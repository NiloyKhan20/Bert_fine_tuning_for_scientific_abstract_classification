0,1.0,"Bremsstrahlung emission of photons during nuclear reactions inside dense
stellar medium is investigated in the paper. For that, a new model of nucleus
is developed, where nuclear forces combine nucleons as bound system in
dependence on deep location inside compact star. A polytropic model of stars at
index $n=3$ with densities characterized from white dwarf to neutron star is
used. Bremsstrahlung formalism and calculations are well tested on existed
experimental information for scattering of protons of light nuclei in Earth. We
find the following. (1) In neutron stars a phenomenon of dissociation of
nucleus is observed --- its disintegration on individual nucleons, starting
from some critical distance between this nucleus and center of star with high
density. We do not observe such a phenomenon in white dwarfs. (2) In the white
dwarfs, influence of stellar medium imperceptibly affects on bremsstrahlung
photons. Also, we have accurate description of bremsstrahlung photons in
nuclear reactions in Sun. (3) For neutron stars, influence of stellar medium is
essentially more intensive and it crucially changes the bremsstrahlung
spectrum. The most intensive emission is from bowel of the star, while the
weakest emission is from periphery.",Astronomy
1,2.0,"We present a detailed systematics for comparing warped brane inflation with
the observations, incorporating the effects of both moduli stabilization and
ultraviolet bulk physics. We explicitly construct an example of the inflaton
potential governing the motion of a mobile D3 brane in the entire warped
deformed conifold. This allows us to precisely identify the corresponding
scales of the cosmic microwave background. The effects due to bulk fluxes or
localized sources are parametrized using gauge/string duality. We next perform
some sample scannings to explore the parameter space of the complete potential,
and first demonstrate that without the bulk effects there can be large
degenerate sets of parameters with observationally consistent predictions. When
the bulk perturbations are included, however, the observational predictions are
generally spoiled. For them to remain consistent, the magnitudes of the bulk
effects need to be highly suppressed via fine tuning.",Astronomy
2,3.0,"The new generation of 8 to 10m class telescope is providing us with
high-quality spectral information on the rest-frame ultraviolet region of
star-forming galaxies at cosmological distances. The data can be used to
address questions such as, e.g., the star-formation histories, the stellar
initial mass function, the dust properties, and the energetics and chemistry of
the interstellar medium. We can tackle these issues from a different angle by
comparing the spectral properties of high-redshift galaxies to those of their
counterparts in the local universe. I give a review of recent developments
related to observations and empirical modeling of the ultraviolet spectra of
local galaxies with recent star formation. The emphasis is on the youngest
stellar populations with ages less than 100 Myr. Current uncertainties will be
discussed, and areas where progress is needed in the future are highlighted.",Astronomy
3,4.0,"The blazar 3C 454.3 was revealed by the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope to be
in an exceptionally high flux state in July 2008. Accordingly, we performed a
multi-wavelength monitoring campaign on this blazar using IR and optical
observations from the SMARTS telescopes, optical, UV and X-ray data from the
Swift satellite, and public-release gamma-ray data from Fermi. We find an
excellent correlation between the IR, optical, UV and gamma-ray light curves,
with a time lag of less than one day. The amplitude of the infrared variability
is comparable to that in gamma-rays, and larger than at optical or UV
wavelengths. The X-ray flux is not strongly correlated with either the
gamma-rays or longer wavelength data. These variability characteristics find a
natural explanation in the external Compton model, in which electrons with
Lorentz factor gamma~10^(3-4) radiate synchrotron emission in the
infrared-optical and also scatter accretion disk or emission line photons to
gamma-ray energies, while much cooler electrons (gamma~10^(1-2)) produce X-rays
by scattering synchrotron or other ambient photons.",Astronomy
4,5.0,"We investigate the biases and uncertainties in estimates of physical
parameters of high-redshift Lyman break galaxies (LBGs), such as stellar mass,
mean stellar population age, and star formation rate (SFR), obtained from
broad-band photometry. By combining LCDM hierarchical structure formation
theory, semi-analytic treatments of baryonic physics, and stellar population
synthesis models, we construct model galaxy catalogs from which we select LBGs
at redshifts z ~ 3.4, 4.0, and 5.0. The broad-band spectral energy
distributions (SEDs) of these model LBGs are then analysed by fitting galaxy
template SEDs derived from stellar population synthesis models with smoothly
declining SFRs. We compare the statistical properties of LBGs' physical
parameters -- such as stellar mass, SFR, and stellar population age -- as
derived from the best-fit galaxy templates with the intrinsic values from the
semi-analytic model. We find some trends in these distributions: first, when
the redshift is known, SED-fitting methods reproduce the input distributions of
LBGs' stellar masses relatively well, with a minor tendency to underestimate
the masses overall, but with substantial scatter. Second, there are large
systematic biases in the distributions of best-fit SFRs and mean ages, in the
sense that single-component SED-fitting methods underestimate SFRs and
overestimate ages. We attribute these trends to the different star formation
histories predicted by the semi-analytic models and assumed in the galaxy
templates used in SED-fitting procedure, and to the fact that light from the
current generation of star-formation can hide older generations of stars. These
biases, which arise from the SED-fitting procedure, can significantly affect
inferences about galaxy evolution from broadband photometry.",Astronomy
5,6.0,"We investigate the effects of neutrino heating and alpha-particle
recombination on the hydrodynamics of core-collapse supernovae. Our focus is on
the non-linear dynamics of the shock wave that forms in the collapse, and the
assembly of positive energy material below it. To this end, we perform
time-dependent hydrodynamic simulations with FLASH2.5 in spherical and axial
symmetry. These generalize our previous calculations by allowing for bulk
neutrino heating and for nuclear statistical equilibrium between n, p and
alpha. The heating rate is freely tunable, as is the starting radius of the
shock relative to the recombination radius of alpha-particles. An explosion in
spherical symmetry involves the excitation of an overstable mode, which may be
viewed as the L=0 version of the `Standing Accretion Shock Instability'. In 2D
simulations, non-spherical deformations of the shock are driven by plumes of
material with positive Bernoulli parameter, which are concentrated well outside
the zone of strong neutrino heating. The non-spherical modes of the shock reach
a large amplitude only when the heating rate is also high enough to excite
convection below the shock. The critical heating rate that causes an explosion
depends sensitively on the initial position of the shock relative to the
recombination radius. Weaker heating is required to drive an explosion in 2D
than in 1D, but the difference also depends on the size of the shock. Forcing
the infalling heavy nuclei to break up into n and p below the shock only causes
a slight increase in the critical heating rate, except when the shock starts
out at a large radius. This shows that heating by neutrinos (or some other
mechanism) must play a significant role in pushing the shock far enough out
that recombination heating takes over.",Astronomy
6,7.0,"Application of concepts like black hole and event horizon in cosmological
context are not trivial, as has been shown in the last decade. We introduce
special solutions of the LTB family representing collapsing over-dense regions
extending to an expanding closed, open, or flat FRW model asymptotically. We
study the dynamics of the collapsing region, and its density profile. The
question of the strength of the central singularity and its nakedness, as well
as the existence of an apparent horizon and an event horizon is dealt with in
detail. Differences to the Schwarzschild black hole are addressed.",Astronomy
7,8.0,"Are black holes elementary particles? Are they fermions or bosons? We
investigate the remarkable possibility that quantum black holes are the
smallest and heaviest elementary particles. We are able to construct various
fundamental quantum black holes: the spin-0, spin 1/2, spin-1, and the
Planck-charge cases, using the results in general relativity. Quantum black
holes in the neighborhood of the Galaxy could resolve the paradox posed by the
Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin limit on the energy of cosmic rays from distant
sources. They could also play a role as dark matter in cosmology.",Astronomy
8,9.0,"The association of an electromagnetic signal with the merger of a pair of
supermassive black holes would have many important implications. For example,
it would provide new information about gas and magnetic field interactions in
dynamical spacetimes as well as a combination of redshift and luminosity
distance that would enable precise cosmological tests. A proposal first made by
Bode &amp; Phinney (2007) is that because radiation of gravitational waves during
the final inspiral and merger of the holes is abrupt and decreases the mass of
the central object by a few percent, there will be waves in the disk that can
steepen into shocks and thus increase the disk luminosity in a characteristic
way. We evaluate this process analytically and numerically. We find that shocks
only occur when the fractional mass loss exceeds the half-thickness (h/r) of
the disk, hence significant energy release only occurs for geometrically thin
disks which are thus at low Eddington ratios. This strongly limits the
effective energy release, and in fact our simulations show that the natural
variations in disk luminosity are likely to obscure this effect entirely.
However, we demonstrate that the reduction of luminosity caused by the retreat
of the inner edge of the disk following mass loss is potentially detectable.
This decrease occurs even if the disk is geometrically thick, and lasts for a
duration on the order of the viscous time of the modified disk.
Observationally, the best prospect for detection would be a sensitive future
X-ray instrument with a field of view of on the order of a square degree, or
possibly a wide-field radio array such as the Square Kilometer Array, if the
disk changes produce or interrupt radio emission from a jet.",Astronomy
9,10.0,"We propose that a nearby gamma-ray burst (GRB) or GRB-like (old, single and
short-lived) pulsar/supernova remnant/microquasar about 10^{5-6} years ago may
be responsible for the excesses of cosmic-ray positrons and electrons recently
observed by the PAMELA, ATIC/PPB-BETS, Fermi and HESS experiments. We can
reproduce the smooth Fermi/HESS spectra as well as the spiky ATIC/PPB-BETS
spectra. The spectra have a sharp cutoff that is similar to the dark matter
predictions, sometimes together with a line (not similar), since higher energy
cosmic-rays cool faster where the cutoff/line energy marks the source age. A
GRB-like astrophysical source is expected to have a small but finite spread in
the cutoff/line as well as anisotropy in the cosmic-ray and diffuse gamma-ray
flux, providing a method for the Fermi and future CALET experiments to
discriminate between dark matter and astrophysical origins.",Astronomy
10,11.0,"We study the impact of catastrophic errors occurring in the photometric
redshifts of galaxies on cosmological parameter estimates with cosmic shear
tomography. We consider a fiducial survey with 9-filter set and perform photo-z
measurement simulations. It is found that a fraction of 1% galaxies at
z_{spec}~0.4 is misidentified to be at z_{phot}~3.5. We then employ both chi^2
fitting method and the extension of Fisher matrix formalism to evaluate the
bias on the equation of state parameters of dark energy, w_0 and w_a, induced
by those catastrophic outliers. By comparing the results from both methods, we
verify that the estimation of w_0 and w_a from the fiducial 5-bin tomographic
analyses can be significantly biased. To minimize the impact of this bias, two
strategies can be followed: (A) the cosmic shear analysis is restricted to
0.5&lt;z&lt;2.5 where catastrophic redshift errors are expected to be insignificant;
(B) a spectroscopic survey is conducted for galaxies with 3&lt;z_{phot}&lt;4. We find
that the number of spectroscopic redshifts needed scales as N_{spec} \propto
f_{cata}\times A where f_{cata}=1% is the fraction of catastrophic redshift
errors (assuming a 9-filter photometric survey) and A is the survey area. For
A=1000 {deg}^2, we find that N_{spec}&gt;320 and 860 respectively in order to
reduce the joint bias in (w_0,w_a) to be smaller than 2\sigma and 1\sigma. This
spectroscopic survey (option B) will improve the Figure of Merit of option A by
a factor \times 1.5 thus making such a survey strongly desirable.",Astronomy
11,12.0,"Our ability to determine stellar ages from measurements of stellar rotation,
hinges on how well we can measure the dependence of rotation on age for stars
of different masses. Rotation periods for stars in open clusters are essential
to determine the relations between stellar age, rotation, and mass (color).
Until recently, ambiguities in vsini data and lack of cluster membership
information, prevented a clear empirical definition of the dependence of
rotation on color. Direct measurements of stellar rotation periods for members
in young clusters have now revealed a well-defined period-color relation. We
show new results for the open clusters M35 and M34. However, rotation periods
based on ground-based observations are limited to young clusters. The Hyades
represent the oldest coeval population of stars with measured rotation periods.
Measurements of rotation periods for older stars are needed to properly
constrain the dependence of stellar rotation on age. We present our plans to
use the Kepler space telescope to measure rotation periods in clusters as old
as and older than the Sun.",Astronomy

the evolutionary model are as follow: $M_{1,i} = 0.88 M_\odot $, $M_{2,i} =
0.85 M_\odot $, $P_i=1.35 $days, $f_1$=0.05, $f_2$=4.65 and Z=0.006

50 per cent of initial total orbital momentum but only 5 per cent of initial
total mass. The less massive component have a small helium core of mass
0.12--0.17$ M_\odot $ and exchange mass in the nuclear time scale.",Astronomy
13,14.0,"The super-storm of November 20, 2003 was associated with a high speed coronal
mass ejection which originated in the NOAA AR 10501 on November 18. This
coronal mass ejection had severe terrestrial consequences leading to a
geomagnetic storm with DST index of -472 nT, the strongest of the current solar
cycle. In this paper, we attempt to understand the factors that led to the
coronal mass ejection on November 18. We have also studied the evolution of the
photospheric magnetic field of NOAA AR 10501, the source region of this coronal
mass ejection. For this purpose, the MDI line-of-sight magnetograms and vector
magnetograms from Solar Flare Telescope, Mitaka, obtained during November,
17-19, 2003 were analysed. In particular, quantitative estimates of the
temporal variation in magnetic flux, energy and magnetic field gradient were
estimated for the source active region. The evolution of these quantities was
studied for the 3-day period with an objective to understand the pre-flare
configuration leading up to the moderate flare which was associated with the
geo-effective coronal mass ejection. We also examined the chromospheric images
recorded in H-alpha from Udaipur Solar Observatory to compare the flare
location with regions of different magnetic field and energy. Our observations
provide evidence that the flare associated with the CME occurred at a location
marked by high magnetic field gradient which led to release of free energy
stored in the active region.",Astronomy

that the hyperon bulk viscosity is suppressed in a superconducting phase. The

us an alternative perspective to understand the universe without the demand of
the elusive cold dark matter. This MONDian paradigm is not only competitive
with the conventional CDM in a large range of scales, but also even more
successful in the galactic scale. Recently, by studying 6 lensing systems,
Ferreras et al. (2008) claimed that MOND still needs dark matter even in
galactic scales. When we study the same systems, however, we yield an opposite
conclusion. In this contribution, we report our result and conclude that MOND

our study to 22 SLACS (Sloan Lens ACS Survey) lenses, and obtain the same

17,18.0,"Europa is believed to have formed near the very end of Jupiter's own
accretion, within a circumplanetary disk of gas and solid particles. We review
the formation of the Galilean satellites in the context of current constraints
and understanding of giant planet formation, focusing on recent models of
satellite growth within a circumjovian accretion disk produced during the final
stages of gas inflow to Jupiter. In such a disk, the Galilean satellites would
have accreted slowly, in more than 10^5 yr, and in a low pressure, low gas
density environment. Gravitational interactions between the satellites and the
gas disk lead to inward orbital migration and loss of satellites to Jupiter.
Such effects tend to select for a maximum satellite mass and a common total
satellite system mass compared to the planet's mass. One implication is that
multiple satellite systems may have formed and been lost during the final
stages of Jupiter's growth, with the Galilean satellites being the last
generation that survived as gas inflow to Jupiter ended. We conclude by
discussing open issues and implications for Europa's conditions of formation.",Astronomy
18,19.0,"The findings of a nine orbit calibration plan carried out during HST Cycle
15, to fully determine the NICMOS camera 2 (2.0 micron) polarization
calibration to high accuracy, are reported. Recently Ueta et al. and Batcheldor

polarization at a level of 1.2-1.5%. This would completely inhibit the data
reduction in a number of GO programs, and hamper the ability of the instrument
to perform high accuracy polarimetry. We obtained polarimetric calibration
observations of three polarimetric standards at three spacecraft roll angles
separated by ~60deg. Combined with archival data, these observations were used
to characterize the residual instrumental polarization in order for NICMOS to
reach its full potential of accurate imaging polarimetry at p~1%. Using these
data, we place an 0.6% upper limit on the instrumental polarization and
calculate values of the parallel transmission coefficients that reproduce the
ground-based results for the polarimetric standards. The uncertainties
associated with the parallel transmission coefficients, a result of the
photometric repeatability of the observations, are seen to dominate the
accuracy of p and theta. However, the updated coefficients do allow imaging
polarimetry of targets with p~1.0% at an accuracy of +/-0.6% and +/-15deg. This

optimization for global minimization problems defined in this context. The
versatility of the framework notably allows introduction of specific prior
information on the signals, which offers the possibility of significant
improvements of reconstruction relative to the standard local matching pursuit
algorithm CLEAN used in radio astronomy. We illustrate the potential of the
approach by studying reconstruction performances on simulations of two
different kinds of signals observed with very generic interferometric

22,23.0,"Radio synchrotron emission, its polarization and its Faraday rotation are
powerful tools to study the strength and structure of interstellar magnetic
fields. The total intensity traces the strength and distribution of total
magnetic fields. Total fields in gas-rich spiral arms and bars of nearby
galaxies have strengths of 20-30 $\mu$Gauss, due to the amplification of
turbulent fields, and are dynamically important. In the Milky Way, the total
field strength is about 6 $\mu$G near the Sun and several 100 $\mu$G in
filaments near the Galactic Center. -- The polarized intensity measures ordered
fields with a preferred orientation, which can be regular or anisotropic
fields. Ordered fields with spiral structure exist in grand-design, barred,
flocculent and even in irregular galaxies. The strongest ordered fields are

optical arms. Halo fields are X-shaped, probably due to outflows. -- The
Faraday rotation of the polarization vectors traces coherent regular fields
which have a preferred direction. In some galaxies Faraday rotation reveals
large-scale patterns which are signatures of dynamo fields. However, in most

  We analyse the spectra of 5 massive clusters in M82, using data acquired with

recent collection of empirical and theoretical spectra of red supergiant stars.
We obtain excellent fits across the near-IR with models at quasi-solar

strong degeneracy between age and extinction in the near-IR colours in the red
supergiant-dominated phase of evolution. The estimated near-IR ages cluster
between 9 and 30 Myr, i.e. the ages at which the molecular bands due to
luminous red supergiants are strongest in the current models. They do not

The outer part of this inner envelope, however, may have a rotation velocity
decreasing toward the center and thus represent a region where an infalling

31,32.0,"Magnetospheres of neutron stars are anchored in the rigid crust and can be
twisted by sudden crustal motions (""starquakes""). The twisted magnetosphere
does not remain static and gradually untwists, dissipating magnetic energy and

solutions are presented. Two distinct regions coexist in untwisting
magnetospheres: a potential region where curl(B)=0 (""cavity"") and a
current-carrying bundle of field lines (""j-bundle""). The cavity has a sharp
boundary, which expands with time and eventually erases all of the twist. In
this process, the electric current of the j-bundle is sucked into the star.
Observational appearance of the untwisting process is discussed. A hot spot
forms at the footprints of the j-bundle. The spot shrinks with time toward the
magnetic dipole axis, and its luminosity and temperature gradually decrease. As
the j-bundle shrinks, the amplitude of its twist can grow to the maximum
possible value ~ 1. The strong twist near the dipole axis increases the
spindown rate of the star and can generate a broad beam of radio emission. The
model explains the puzzling behavior of magnetar XTE J1810-197 -- a canonical

41,42.0,"Collapsars are fast-spinning, massive stars, whose core collapse liberates an
energy, that can be channeled in the form of ultrarelativistic jets. These jets
transport the energy from the collapsed core to large distances, where it is
dissipated in the form of long-duration gamma-ray bursts. In this paper we
study the dynamics of ultrarelativistic jets produced in collapsars. Also we
extrapolate our results to infer the angular energy distribution of the
produced outflows in the afterglow phase. Our main focus is to look for global
energetical properties which can be imprinted by the different structure of
different progenitor stars. Thus, we employ a number of pre-supernova, stellar
models (with distinct masses and metallicities), and inject in all of them jets
with fixed initial conditions. We assume that at the injection nozzle, the jet
is mildly relativistic (Lorentz factor $\sim 5$), has a finite half-opening
angle ($5^\circ$), and carries a power of $10^{51} $erg s$^{-1}$. These jets
arrive intact to the stellar surface and break out of it. A large Lorentz
factor region $\Gamma\simmore 100$ develops well before the jet reaches the
surface of the star, in the unshocked part of the beam, located between the
injection nozzle and the first recollimation shock. These high values of
$\Gamma$ are possible because the finite opening angle of the jet allows for
free expansion towards the radial direction. We find a strong correlation
between the angular energy distribution of the jet, after its eruption from the
progenitor surface, and the mass of the progenitors. The angular energy
distribution of the jets from light progenitor models is steeper than that of
the jets injected in more massive progenitor stars. This trend is also
imprinted in the angular distribution of isotropic equivalent energy.",Astronomy

of an effective first-order equation. Viscosity breaks down the invariance of
the equilibrium conditions for stationary inflow and outflow solutions, and
distinguishes accretion from wind. Under a dynamical systems classification,
the only feasible critical points of this ""quasi-viscous"" flow are saddle
points and spirals. A linearised and radially propagating time-dependent

canonical X-ray afterglow and test them against the closure relations of the
forward shock models for a variety of parameter combinations. The closure
relations are used to identify potential jet breaks with characteristics
including the uniform jet model with and without lateral spreading and energy
injection, and a power-law structured jet model, all with a range of
parameters. With this technique, we survey the X-ray afterglows with strong
evidence for jet breaks (~12% of our sample), and reveal cases of potential jet
breaks that do not appear plainly from the light curve alone (another ~30%),
leading to insight into the missing jet break problem. Those X-ray light curves
that do not show breaks or have breaks that are not consistent with one of the
jet models are explored to place limits on the times of unseen jet breaks. The
distribution of jet break times ranges from a few hours to a few weeks with a
median of ~1 day, similar to what was found pre-Swift. On average Swift GRBs

46,47.0,"Within the context of standard cosmology, an accelerating universe requires
the presence of a third `dark' component of energy, beyond matter and
radiation. The available data, however, are still deemed insufficient to
distinguish between an evolving dark energy component and the simplest model of
a time-independent cosmological constant. In this paper, we examine the
cosmological expansion in terms of observer-dependent coordinates, in addition
to the more conventional co-moving coordinates. This procedure explicitly
reveals the role played by the radius R_h of our cosmic horizon in the
interrogation of the data. (In Rindler's notation, R_h coincides with the
`event horizon' in the case of de Sitter, but changes in time for other
cosmologies that also contain matter and/or radiation.) With this approach, we
show that the interpretation of dark energy as a cosmological constant is
clearly disfavored by the observations. Within the framework of standard
Friedman-Robertson-Walker cosmology, we derive an equation describing the
evolution of R_h, and solve it using the WMAP and Type Ia supernova data. In
particular, we consider the meaning of the observed equality (or near equality)
R_h(t_0) ~ ct_0, where t_0 is the age of the Universe. This empirical result is
far from trivial, for a cosmological constant would drive R_h(t) towards ct
(where t is the cosmic time) only once--and that would have to occur right now.
Though we are not here espousing any particular alternative model of dark
energy, for comparison we also consider scenarios in which dark energy is given
by scaling solutions, which simultaneously eliminate several conundrums in the
standard model, including the `coincidence' and `flatness' problems, and
account very well for the fact that R_h(t_0) ~ ct_0.",Astronomy

the observed fractional rms amplitudes of the twin kHz QPOs. We discuss whether
this displays features that could have a physical meaning in terms of the
proposed QPO models. METHOD: We consider the difference in rms amplitude
between the upper and lower kHz QPOs, as a function of the frequency ratio R.
We compare two data sets. Set I is a collection taken from published data. Set
II has rms amplitude values obtained by automatic fitting of continuous
segments of RXTE-PCA observations. RESULTS: For each of the six sources, we
find that there is a point in the R domain around which the amplitudes of the
two twin kHz QPOs are the same. We find such a point located inside a narrow
interval R=1.5 +-3%. Further investigation is needed in the case of two sources
to explore this finding, since we have not determined this point in Set II.
There is evidence of a similar point close to R = 1.33 or R = 1.25 in the four
sources. We suggest that some of these points may correspond to the documented
clustering of the twin kHz QPO frequency ratios. CONCLUSIONS: For the sources
studied, the rms amplitudes of the two kHz peaks become equal when the
frequencies of the oscillations pass through a certain ratio R, which is
roughly the same for each of the sources. In terms of the orbital QPO models,
with some assumptions concerning the QPO modulation, this finding implies the
existence of a specific orbit at a common value of the dimensionless radius, at
which the oscillations corresponding to the two peaks come into balance. In a
more general context, the amplitude difference behaviour suggests the possible
existence of an energy interchange between the upper and lower QPO modes.",Astronomy
48,49.0,"A new semianalytical model that explains the formation and sizes of the
'great walls' - the largest structures observed in the universe is suggested.
Although the basis of the model is the Zel'dovich approximation it has been
used in a new way very different from the previous studies. Instead of
traditional approach that evaluates the nonlinear density field it has been
utilized for identification of the regions in Lagrangian space that after the
mapping to real or redshift space (depending on the kind of structure is
studied) end up in the regions where shell-crossing occurs. The set of these
regions in Lagrangian space form the progenitor of the structure and after the
mapping it determines the pattern of the structure in real or redshift space.
The particle trajectories have crossed in such regions and the mapping is no
longer unique there. The progenitor after mapping makes only one stream in the
multi-stream flow regions therefore it does not comprise all the mass.
Nevertheless, it approximately retains the shape of the structure. The
progenitor of the structure in redshift space depends on a few non-Gaussian
fields and also it is strongly affected by two anisotropic fields that
determine the pattern of great walls as well as their huge sizes. All the
fields used in the mappings are derived from the linear potential smoothed at
the current scale of nonlinearity which is $R_{nl} = 2.7$ {\hmpc} for the
adopted parameters of the \lcdm universe normalized to $\sigma_8 = 0.8$. The

50,51.0,"Most gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) observed by the Swift satellite show an early
rapid decay phase (RDP) in their X-ray lightcurve, which is usually a smooth
continuation of the prompt gamma-ray emission, strongly suggesting that it is
its tail. However, the mechanism behind it is still not clear. The most popular
model for this RDP is High Latitude Emission (HLE). While HLE is expected in
many models for the prompt GRB emission, such as the popular internal shocks
model, there are models in which it is not expected, such as sporadic magnetic
reconnection events. Therefore, testing whether the RDP is consistent with HLE
can help distinguish between different prompt emission models. We address this
question by modeling the prompt emission as the sum of its individual pulses
with their HLE tails. Analytic expressions for the observed flux density are
obtained for power-law and Band function emission spectra. For internal shocks
the observed instantaneous spectrum is very close to the emitted one, and
should be well described by a Band function also during the RDP. Our model
naturally produces, the observed spectral softening and steepening of the flux
decay. The observed flux during the RDP is initially dominated by the tail of
the last pulse, but the tails of one or more earlier pulses can become dominant
later on. Moreover, modeling several overlapping pulses as a single wider pulse
would over-predict the emission tail. Thus, one should be very careful when
testing the predictions of HLE and do a combined temporal and spectral fit of
the prompt GRB emission and the RDP.",Astronomy
51,52.0,"A new solar burst emission spectral component has been found showing sub-THz
fluxes increasing with frequency, spectrally separated from the well known
microwave component. Rapid pulsations are found present in all events observed
at the two frequencies of the solar submillimeter-wave telescope (SST): 212 and
405 GHz. They were studied in greater detail for three solar bursts exhibiting
the new THz spectral component. The pulse amplitudes are of about 5-8% of the
mean flux throughout the bursts durations, being comparable for both
frequencies. Pulsations range from one pulse every few seconds to 8-10 per
second. The pulse repetition rates (R) are linearly proportional to the mean
burst fluxes (S), following the simple relationship S = k R, suggesting that
the pulsations might be the response to discrete flare particle accelerator
injections quantized in energy. Although this result is consistent with
qualitative trends previously found in the GHz range, the pulse amplitude
relative to the mean fluxes at the sub-THz frequencies appear to be nearly ten
times smaller than expected from the extrapolation of the trends found in the

53,54.0,"We study the details of preheating in an inflationary scenario in which the
Standard Model Higgs, strongly non-minimally coupled to gravity, plays the role
of the inflaton. We find that the Universe does not reheat immediately through
perturbative decays, but rather initiate a complex process in which
perturbative and non-perturbative effects are mixed. The Higgs condesate starts
oscillating around the minimum of its potential, producing W and Z gauge bosons
non-perturbatively, due to violation of the so-called adiabaticity condition.
However, during each semi-oscillation, the created gauge bosons completely
decay (perturbatively) into fermions. This way, the decay of the gauge bosons
prevents the development of parametric resonance, since bosons cannot
accummulate significantly at the beginning. However, the energy transferred to
the decay products of the bosons is not enough to reheat the universe, so after
about a hundred oscillations, the resonance effect will finally dominate over
the perturbative decays. Around the same time (or slightly earlier),
backreaction from the gauge bosons onto the Higgs condensate will also start to
be significant. Soon afterwards, the Universe is filled with the remnant
condensate of the Higgs and a non-thermal distribution of Standard Model
particles which redshift as radiation, while the Higgs continues to oscillate
as a pressureless fluid. We compute the distribution of energy among all the

Vishniac (1999) model of magnetic field reconnection of weakly stochastic
fields. The turbulence in the model is assumed to be subAlfvenic, with the
magnetic field only slightly perturbed. The model predicts that the degree of
magnetic field stochasticity controls the reconnection rate and that the
reconnection can be fast independently on the presence or absence of anomalous
plasma effects. For testing of the model we use 3D MHD simulations. To measure
the reconnection rate we employ both the inflow of magnetic flux and a more
sophisticated measure that we introduce in the paper. Both measures of
reconnection provide consistent results. Our testing successfully reproduces
the dependences predicted by the model, including the variations of the
reconnection speed with the variations of the injection scale of turbulence
driving as well as the intensity of driving. We conclude that, while anomalous
and Hall-MHD effects in particular circumstances may be important for the
initiation of reconnection, the generic astrophysical reconnection is fast due
to turbulence, irrespectively of the microphysical plasma effects involved.

have strong internal relaxation of energy which aligns grain axis of maximum
moment of inertia with respect to grain's angular momentum. In this paper, we
study the alignment by radiative torques for large irregular grains, e.g.,
grains in accretion disks, for which internal relaxation is subdominant. We use
both numerical calculations and the analytical model of a helical grain
introduced by us earlier. We demonstrate that grains in such a regime exhibit
more complex dynamics. In particular, if initially the grain axis of maximum
moment of inertia makes a small angle with angular momentum, then radiative
torques can align the grain axis of maximum moment of inertia with angular
momentum, and both axis of maximum moment of inertia and angular momentum are
aligned with the magnetic field when attractors with high angular momentum
(high-J attractors) are available. For the alignment without high-J attractors,
beside the earlier studied attractors with low angular momentum (low-J
attractors), there appears new low-J attractors. The former and later cases
correspond to the alignment with long axes perpendicular and parallel to the
angular momentum, respectively. In addition, we study the alignment of grains
in the presence of strong internal relaxation, but induced not by a radiation
beam as in earlier studies, instead, induced by a complex radiation field, that
can be decomposed into dipole and quadrupole components. We find that in this

64,65.0,"Phenomena currently attributed to Dark Energy (DE) and Dark Matter (DM) are
merely a result of the interplay between gravitational energy density,
generated by the contraction of space by matter, and the energy density of the
Cosmological Microwave Background (CMB), which causes space dilation. In the
universe, globally, the gravitational energy density equals the CMB energy
density. This leads to the derivation of the Hubble parameter, H, as a function
of the scale factor, a, the time, t, the redshift, z, and to the calculation of
its present value. It also leads to a new understanding of the cosmological
redshift and the Euclidian nature of the universe. From H(t) we conclude that
the time derivative of a is constant. This is in contrast to the consensus of
the last decade. This result is supported by the fit of our theoretically
derived flux from supernovae (SN) as a function of z, with observation. This
flux is derived based on our H(z) that determines DL, the Luminosity Distance.
We obtain this fit without any free parameters, whereas in current cosmology
this fit is obtained by using the dependent free parameters Omega_M and
Omega_Lambda.",Astronomy
65,66.0,"We consider the luminosity and environmental dependence of structural
parameters of lenticular galaxies in the near-infrared K band. Using a
two-dimensional galaxy image decomposition technique, we extract bulge and disk
structural parameters for a sample of 36 lenticular galaxies observed by us in
the K band. By combining data from the literature for field and cluster
lenticulars with our data, we study correlations between parameters that
characterise the bulge and the disk as a function of luminosity and
environment. We find that scaling relations such as the Kormendy relation,
photometric plane and other correlations involving bulge and disk parameters
show a luminosity dependence. This dependence can be explained in terms of
galaxy formation models in which faint lenticulars (M_T &gt; -24.5) formed via
secular formation processes that likely formed the pseudobulges of late-type
disk galaxies, while brighter lenticulars (M_T &lt; -24.5) formed through a
different formation mechanism most likely involving major mergers. On probing
variations in lenticular properties as a function of environment, we find that
faint cluster lenticulars show systematic differences with respect to faint
field lenticulars. These differences support the idea that the bulge and disk
components fade after the galaxy falls into a cluster, while simultaneously
undergoing a transformation from spiral to lenticular morphologies.",Astronomy
66,67.0,"Recently the PAMELA satellite-based experiment reported an excess of galactic
positrons that could be a signal of annihilating dark matter. The PAMELA data
may admit an interpretation as a signal from a wino-like LSP of mass about 200
GeV, normalized to the local relic density, and annihilating mainly into
W-bosons. This possibility requires the current conventional estimate for the
energy loss rate of positrons be too large by roughly a factor of five. Data
from anti-protons and gamma rays also provide tension with this interpretation,
but there are significant astrophysical uncertainties associated with their
propagation. It is not unreasonable to take this well-motivated candidate
seriously, at present, in part because it can be tested in several ways soon.
The forthcoming PAMELA data on higher energy positrons and the FGST (formerly
GLAST) data, should provide important clues as to whether this scenario is
correct. If correct, the wino interpretation implies a cosmological history in
which the dark matter does not originate in thermal equilibrium.",Astronomy

both of these properties are a natural consequence of a few million years'
interaction with an intermediate-mass black hole (IBH), if the latter's orbit
is mildly eccentric and if its mass exceeds approximately 1500 solar masses.
Producing the most tightly-bound S-stars requires an IBH orbit with periastron

69,70.0,"The ACS Survey of Galactic Globular Clusters is a Hubble Space Telescope
(HST) Treasury program designed to provide a new large, deep and homogeneous
photometric database. Based on observations from this program, we have measured
precise relative ages for a sample of 64 Galactic globular clusters by
comparing the relative position of the clusters' main sequence turn offs, using
main-sequence fitting to cross-compare clusters within the sample. This method
provides relative ages to a formal precision of 2-7%. We demonstrate that the
calculated relative ages are independent of the choice of theoretical model. We
find that the Galactic globular cluster sample can be divided into two groups
-- a population of old clusters with an age dispersion of ~5% and no
age-metallicity relation, and a group of younger clusters with an
age-metallicity relation similar to that of the globular clusters associated
with the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy.
  These results are consistent with the Milky Way halo having formed in two
phases or processes. The first one would be compatible with a rapid (&lt;0.8 Gyr)
assembling process of the halo, in which the clusters in the old group were
formed. Also these clusters could have been formed before reionization in dwarf
galaxies that would later merge to build the Milky Way halo as predicted by
Lambda-CDM cosmology. However, the galactocentric metallicity gradient shown by
these clusters seems difficult to reconcile with the latter. As for the younger
clusters, it is very tempting to argue that their origin is related to their
formation within Milky Way satellite galaxies that were later accreted, but the
origin of the age-metallicity relation remains unclear.",Astronomy

possible correlations and find some possible new ones. We use VLT-FORS images
through BVRI filters of 32 Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs) and obtain their colors
after proper reduction and calibration. We study the possible correlations
merging these new measurements with the VLT published results from the ESO

color vs. orbital parameters for the different dynamical groups. We find that
some correlations in the classical group, as well as the (dynamically) cold and

we were able to identify new candidates for light curve studies and found that
~55% of the objects showed variability above 0.15 mags. This is a higher value

smaller TNOs are more elongated than the larger ones.",Astronomy
72,73.0,"The Kozai mechanism often destabilises high inclination orbits. It couples
changes in the eccentricity and inclination, and drives high inclination,
circular orbits to low inclination, eccentric orbits. In a recent study of the
dynamics of planetesimals in the quadruple star system HD98800 (Verrier &amp; Evans
2008), there were significant numbers of stable particles in circumbinary polar
orbits about the inner binary pair which are apparently able to evade the Kozai
instability. Here, we isolate this feature and investigate the dynamics through
numerical and analytical models. The results show that the Kozai mechanism of
the outer star is disrupted by a nodal libration induced by the inner binary
pair on a shorter timescale. By empirically modelling the period of the
libration, a criteria for determining the high inclination stability limits in
general triple systems is derived. The nodal libration feature is interesting
and, although effecting inclination and node only, shows many parallels to the
Kozai mechanism. This raises the possibility that high inclination planets and

holography by the mass of a black hole which just fits in that region, which

proportional to $M_p^2/L^2$, where $M_p$ is the Planck mass and $L$ is the
spatial scale of that region under consideration. Assuming the maximal black
hole in the universe is formed through gravitational collapse of perturbations
in the universe, then the ""Jeans"" scale of the perturbations gives a causal

cosmological dynamics of the corresponding vacuum energy density by choosing
the causal connection scale as the IR cutoff in the UV/IR relation, in the
cases of the vacuum energy density as an independently conserved energy
component and an effective dynamical cosmological constant, respectively. It
turns out that only the case with the choice $R_{\rm CC}^{-2}= \dot H +2H^2$,

nature in the highly non--linear regime. These have a direct impact on the
turnaround, virialisation and collapse times, altering in consequence the
non--linear density contrast and virial radius. We compute halo concentrations
using the Eke, Navarro &amp; Steinmetz algorithm, examining two extreme scenarios:
first, we assume that the quintessence field does not exhibit fluctuations on
cluster scales and below - homogeneous fluid; second, we assume that the field
inside the overdensity collapses along with the dark matter - inhomogeneous
fluid. The Eke, Navarro &amp; Steinmetz prescription reveals, in general, higher
halo concentrations in inhomogeneous dark energy models than in their
homogeneous equivalents. Halo concentrations appear to be controlled by both
changes in formation epochs of the halo cores as well as by differing
virialisation overdensities. We derive physical halo properties in all models

for comparing observations with theoretical predictions. The first method works
on galaxy cluster scales and consists of fitting the observed X-ray cluster gas

the possibility that quark clustering, rather than a color super-conducting

disturbed stars are supplied into the loss cone. Stars of the dwarf galaxy are
also supplied into the loss cone. The gravitational interactions between the
SMBH binary and these stars become very effective. The gravitational
interaction decreases the binding energy of the SMBH binary effectively. As a
result, the shrink of the separation of the SMBH binary is accelerated. Our
numerical results strongly suggest that the minor mergers are one of the
important processes to reduce the coalescence time of the SMBH binary much less

spectral features reported in the total electron-positron (e+e-) flux measured
by ATIC have a very natural explanation in electron-positron pairs produced by
nearby pulsars. While this possibility was pointed out a long time ago, the
greatly improved quality of current data potentially allow to reverse-engineer
the problem: given the regions of pulsar parameter space favored by PAMELA and
by ATIC, are there known pulsars that explain the data with reasonable
assumptions on the injected e+e- pairs? In the context of simple benchmark
models for estimating the e+e- output, we consider all known pulsars, as listed
in the most complete available catalogue. We find that it is unlikely that a
single pulsar be responsible for both the PAMELA e+ fraction anomaly and for
the ATIC excess, although two single sources are in principle enough to explain
both experimental results. The PAMELA excess e+ likely come from a set of
mature pulsars (age ~ 10^6 yr), with a distance of 0.8-1 kpc, or from a single,
younger and closer source like Geminga. The ATIC data require a larger (and
less plausible) energy output, and favor an origin associated to powerful, more
distant (1-2 kpc) and younger (age ~ 10^5$ yr) pulsars. We list several
candidate pulsars that can individually or coherently contribute to explain the
PAMELA and ATIC data. Although generally suppressed, we find that the
contribution of pulsars more distant than 1-2 kpc could contribute for the ATIC
excess. Finally, we stress the multi-faceted and decisive role that Fermi-LAT

83,84.0,"High-frequency twin peak quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) are observed in
four microquasars, i.e., Galactic black hole binary systems, with frequency
ratio very close to 3:2. In the microquasar GRS 1915+105, the structure of QPOs
exhibits additional frequencies, and more than two frequencies are observed in
the Galaxy nuclei Sgr A*, or in some extragalactic sources (NGC 4051,
MCG-6-30-15 and NGC 5408 X-1). The observed QPOs can be explained by a variety
of the orbital resonance model versions assuming resonance of oscillations with
the Keplerian frequency or the vertical epicyclic frequency, and the radial
epicyclic frequency, or some combinations of these frequencies. Generally,
different resonances could arise at different radii of an accretion disc.
However, we have shown that for special values of dimensionless black hole spin
strong resonant phenomena could occur when different resonances can be excited
at the same radius, as cooperative phenomena between the resonances may work in
such situations. The special values of black hole spin are determined for
triple frequency ratio sets \nu_{K} : \nu_{\theta} : \nu_{r} = s:t:u with s, t,

a = 0.866, 0.882 and 0.962. Assuming the extraordinary resonant spin a = 0.983

  Results: The population of elliptical systems analysed here present a
systematic change through time, i.e. evolution, by becoming rounder in general
at z=0 and, at the same time more velocity dispersion supported. This is found
to be primarily due to major dry mergers where only a modest amount of angular
momentum is involved into the merger event. Despite the general trend, in a
significant amount of cases the merger event involves a higher specific angular
momentum, which in general causes the system to acquire a higher rotational

at 2PN order, and spin-spin terms at 2PN order. Restricting ourselves to
quasi-circular orbits, we integrate the linear momentum flux over time to

increase the recoil velocity up to about a factor 3 with respect to the
leading-order PN prediction. Furthermore, we provide expressions valid for

Specializing to quasi-circular orbits we compute the spin-spin terms at 2PN

evolution around the Z-track in GX 5-1 based on high-quality RXTE data. The
Extended ADC emission model provides very good fits to the spectra, the results
pointing clearly to a model for the nature of the Z-track, in agreement with
previous results for the similar source GX 340+0. In this model, at the soft
apex of the Z-track, the mass accretion rate Mdot is minimum and the neutron
star has its lowest temperature; but as the source moves along the normal
branch, the luminosity of the Comptonized emission increases, indicating that
Mdot increases and the neutron star gets hotter. The measured flux f of the
neutron star emission increases by a factor of ten becoming super-Eddington,
and we propose that this disrupts the inner disk so forming jets. In flaring,
the luminosity of the dominant Comptonized emission from the ADC is constant,
while the neutron star emission increases, and we propose for the first time
that flaring consists of unstable nuclear burning on the neutron star, and the
measured mass accretion rate per unit area mdot at the onset of flaring agrees
well with the theoretical critical value at which burning becomes unstable.
There is a striking correlation between the frequencies of the kHz QPO and the
ratio of the flux to the Eddington value: f/f_Edd, suggesting an explanation of
the higher frequency QPO and of its variation along the Z-track. It is well
known that a Keplerian orbit in the disk at this frequency corresponds to a
position some distance from the neutron star; we propose that the oscillation

upper normal and horizontal branches as the measured increasing radiation
pressure increasingly disrupts the inner disk.",Astronomy

intermediate-redshift clusters. New HST observations, Spitzer photometry and
ground-based spectroscopy cover most of a region of the cluster about 10 arcmin
across, corresponding to a clustercentric radial distance of about 1.6 Mpc.
This spatial coverage allows us to confirm the existence of a
morphology-density relation within this cluster, and to identify several large,
presumably infalling, subsystems. We confirm our previous conclusion that a
very large fraction of the starforming galaxies in A851 have recently undergone
starbursts. We argue that starbursts are mostly confined to two kinds of sites:
infalling groups and the cluster center. At the cluster center it appears that
infalling galaxies are undergoing major mergers, resulting in starbursts whose
optical emission lines are completely buried beneath dust. The aftermath of
this process appears to be proto-S0 galaxies devoid of star formation. In
contrast, major mergers do not appear to be the cause of most of the starbursts
in infalling groups, and fewer of these events result in the transformation of
the galaxy into an S0. Some recent theoretical work provides possible
explanations for these two distinct processes, but it is not clear whether they

cosmology: the Baugh et al. (2005) model, which assumes a top-heavy initial
mass function (IMF) in starbursts and superwind feedback, and the Bower et al.
(2006) model, which uses AGN feedback and a standard IMF. The Bower et al model
better reproduces the overall shape of the luminosity function, the
morphology-luminosity relation and the colour bimodality observed in the SDSS
data, but gives a poor match to the size-luminosity relation. The \Baugh et al.
model successfully predicts the size-luminosity relation for late-type
galaxies. Both models fail to reproduce the sizes of bright early-type
galaxies. These problems highlight the need to understand better both the role
of feedback processes in determining galaxy sizes, in particular the treatment
of the angular momentum of gas reheated by supernovae, and the sizes of the

This synchronization eliminates collisions between particles and suppress the
diffusion induced by collisions by orders of magnitude. The minimum of the
diffusion is reached at the center of the synchronization regime corresponding
to the ratio 2:1 between the orbital frequency at the edge of B ring and the

candidate as the main source of short-lived radionuclides in the early solar

stars experience proton captures at the base of the convective envelope (hot
bottom burning), together with high-neutron density nucleosynthesis with 22Ne
as a neutron source in the He shell and efficient dredge-up of the processed
material. A model of a 6.5 solar masses star of solar metallicity can
simultaneously match the abundances of 26Al, 41Ca, 60Fe, and 107Pd inferred to
have been present in the solar nebula by using a dilution factor of 1 part of
AGB material per 300 parts of original solar nebula material, and taking into
account a time interval between injection of the short-lived nuclides and
consolidation of the first meteorites equal to 0.53 Myr. Such a polluting
source does not overproduce 53Mn, as supernova models do, and only marginally
affects isotopic ratios of stable elements. It is usually argued that it is
unlikely that the short-lived radionuclides in the early solar system came from
an AGB star because these stars are rarely found in star forming regions,

distribution will be formed if photons with frequency \sim \nu_0 have undergone
a ten thousand or more times of scattering, which corresponds to the order of
10^3 yrs for neutral hydrogen density of the concordance \Lambda CDM model. The
time evolution of the shape and width of the local Boltzmann distribution

initial conditions very much. However, the intensity of photon flux at the
local Boltzmann distribution is substantially time-dependent. The time scale of
approaching the saturated intensity can be as long as 10^5-10^6 yrs for typical

114,115.0,"The dynamics of infinite, asymptotically uniform, distributions of
self-gravitating particles in one spatial dimension provides a simple toy model
for the analogous three dimensional problem. We focus here on a limitation of
such models as treated so far in the literature: the force, as it has been
specified, is well defined in infinite point distributions only if there is a
centre of symmetry (i.e. the definition requires explicitly the breaking of
statistical translational invariance). The problem arises because naive
background subtraction (due to expansion, or by ""Jeans' swindle"" for the static
case), applied as in three dimensions, leaves an unregulated contribution to
the force due to surface mass fluctuations. Following a discussion by
Kiessling, we show that the problem may be resolved by defining the force in
infinite point distributions as the limit of an exponentially screened pair
interaction. We show that this prescription gives a well defined (finite) force
acting on particles in a class of perturbed infinite lattices, which are the
point processes relevant to cosmological N-body simulations. For identical
particles the dynamics of the simplest toy model is equivalent to that of an
infinite set of points with inverted harmonic oscillator potentials which
bounce elastically when they collide. We discuss previous results in the
literature, and present new results for the specific case of this simplest

neutral alkali metals are observed to show P-Cyg profiles. Particularly
interesting are numerous prominent emission lines of [FeII]. All of them show
practically the same profile, which can be well described by a Lorentzian

for these two microquasars in order to show that the distances of probably all
microquasars in our galaxy are much more uncertain than currently admitted.
Moreover, we show that many confirmations of quantitative results are often
entangled and rely on very uncertain measurements. We also present a new
determination of the maximum distance of GRO J1655-40 using red clump giant

kpc instead of 3.2 kpc. Since it then becomes more likely that GRO J1655-40

review the distance estimations of A0620-00, which is so far the closest black
hole with an average distance of about 1.0 kpc. We show that the distance

evetually reveal more about the interplay of turbulence and the magnetic field
lines. In this work we provide a number of MHD numerical simulations of
turbulent molecular clouds and created their synthetic dust emission
polarization maps, varying the direction of the observer. We determined the
correlation of emission intensity and polarization degree for the simulated

regions without any assumption regarding the properties of the dusty component.
The anti-correlation arises from the simple cancelation of the polarization
vectors along the line of sight. This effect is amplified within denser regions
as the magnetic field configuration becomes more complex. We studied the
probability distribution, the power spectrum and the structure function of the
polarization angles. These statistical analysis revealed strong defferences
depending on the turbulent regime (i.e. sub/supersonic and sub/super-Alfvenic).
Therefore, these methods can be used on polarimetric observations to

can be interpreted as evidence for coronal currents, with values as large as
$2.5 \times 10^9$ Amperes (Spangler 2007). These estimates of currents are used
to develop a model for Joule heating in the corona. It is assumed that the
currents are concentrated in thin current sheets, as suggested by theories of
two dimensional magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. The Spitzer result for the
resistivity is adopted as a lower limit to the true resistivity. The calculated
volumetric heating rate is compared with an independent theoretical estimate by
Cranmer et al (2007). This latter estimate accounts for the dynamic and
thermodynamic properties of the corona at a heliocentric distance of several
solar radii. Our calculated Joule heating rate is less than the Cranmer et al
estimate by at least a factor of $3 \times 10^5$. The currents inferred from
the observations of Spangler (2007) are not relevant to coronal heating unless
the true resistivity is enormously increased relative to the Spitzer value.
However, the same model for turbulent current sheets used to calculate the
heating rate also gives an electron drift speed which can be comparable to the
electron thermal speed, and larger than the ion acoustic speed. It is therefore
possible that the coronal current sheets are unstable to current-driven
instabilities which produce high levels of waves, enhance the resistivity and
thus the heating rate.",Astronomy

spectrum representing the effective photospheric absorption profile modified by
pulsations. Difference spectra were calculated by subtracting rotationally
broadened artificial profiles; these residual spectra were analysed and
non-radial pulsations were detected. A subsequent analysis with two
complementary methods, namely Fourier Parameter Fit (FPF) and Fourier 2D (F2D)
has been performed and first constraints on the pulsation modes have been
derived. In fact, both components of the spectroscopic binary are Herbig Ae

126,127.0,"We argue that we may be able to sort out dark matter models in which
electrons are generated through the annihilation and/or decay of dark matter,
by using a fact that the initial energy spectrum is reflected in the cosmic-ray
electron flux observed at the Earth even after propagation through the galactic
magnetic field. To illustrate our idea we focus on three representative initial
spectra: (i)monochromatic (ii)flat and (iii)double-peak ones. We find that
those three cases result in significantly different energy spectra, which may
be probed by the Fermi satellite in operation or an up-coming cosmic-ray

$-3.54\times10^{-14}$ Hz s$^{-1}$ before 1999. From RXTE observations after
March 2001, the source showed a $\sim 60$% decrease in spin-down magnitude and
INTEGRAL observations after March 2003 showed that source started to spin-up.
We found that the source recently entered a new spin-down episode with a
spin-down rate of $-3.59 \times 10^{-14}$ Hz s$^{-1}$. This spin-down rate is
pretty close to the previous long term spin-down rate of the source measured
before 1999. From the spectral analysis, we showed that Hydrogen column density

Lyr variables of globular cluster Omega Cen.
  Methods: We conducted a systematic frequency analysis of CASE photometry of
Omega Cen RR Lyr stars. We searched for periodicities using Fourier and ANOVA
periodograms, combined with consecutive prewhitening technique.
  Results: We discovered six double mode pulsators, with the first overtone and
a secondary mode of higher frequency simultaneously excited. These are the
first double mode RR Lyr stars identified in Omega Cen. In variable V10 period
ratio of the two modes is 0.80, which corresponds to pulsations in the first
and second radial overtones. In V19 and V105 we found unexpected period ratio
of 0.61. Three other stars display period ratios of either ~0.80 or ~0.61,
depending on the choice of aliases.
  Conclusions: While the period ratio of ~0.80 is easy to interpret in terms of
two lowest radial overtones, the value of ~0.61 cannot be explained by any two
radial modes. Thus, V19 and V105 are the first members of a new class of double

132,133.0,"Over the last decade, X-ray observations unveiled the existence of several
classes of isolated neutron stars (INSs) which are radio-quiet or exhibit radio
emission with properties much at variance with those of ordinary radio pulsars.
The identification of new sources is crucial in order to understand the
relations among the different classes and to compare observational constraints
with theoretical expectations. A recent analysis of the 2XMMp catalogue
provided less than 30 new thermally emitting INS candidates. Among these, the
source 2XMM J104608.7-594306 appears particularly interesting because of the
softness of its X-ray spectrum and of the present upper limits in the optical,
which imply a logarithmic X-ray-to-optical flux ratio greater than 3.1,
corrected for absorption. We present the X-ray and optical properties of 2XMM
J104608.7-594306 and discuss its nature in the light of two possible scenarios
invoked to explain the X-ray thermal emission from INSs: the release of
residual heat in a cooling neutron star, as in the seven radio-quiet
ROSAT-discovered INSs, and accretion from the interstellar medium. We find that
the present observational picture of 2XMM J104608.7-594306 is consistent with a
distant cooling INS with properties in agreement with the most up-to-date
expectations of population synthesis models: it is fainter, hotter and more
absorbed than the seven ROSAT sources and possibly located in the Carina
Nebula, a region likely to harbour unidentified cooling neutron stars. The
accretion scenario, although not entirely ruled out by observations, would
require a very slow (~10 km/s) INS accreting at the Bondi-Hoyle rate.",Astronomy

large-scale properties. The zero-level calibration of all-sky surveys differs
from standard 'relative' measurements, where a source is measured in respect to
its surroundings. All-sky surveys aim to include emission structures of all
angular scales exceeding their angular resolution including isotropic emission
components. Synchrotron radiation is the dominating emission process in the
Galaxy up to frequencies of a few GHz, where numerous ground based surveys of
the total intensity up to 1.4 GHz exist. Its polarization properties were just
recently mapped for the entire sky at 1.4 GHz. All-sky total intensity and
linear polarization maps from WMAP for frequencies of 23 GHz and higher became
available and complement existing sky maps. Galactic plane surveys have higher
angular resolution using large single-dish or synthesis telescopes. Polarized
diffuse emission shows structures with no relation to total intensity emission

134,135.0,"The existence of large-scale dynamos in rigidly rotating turbulent convection
without shear is studied using three-dimensional numerical simulations of
penetrative rotating compressible convection. We demonstrate that rotating
convection in a Cartesian domain can drive a large-scale dynamo even in the
absence of shear. The large-scale field contains a significant fraction of the
total field in the saturated state. The simulation results are compared with
one-dimensional mean-field dynamo models where turbulent transport
coefficients, as determined using the test field method, are used. The reason
for the absence of large-scale dynamo action in earlier studies is shown to be
due to the rotation being too slow: whereas the alpha-effect can change sign,
its magnitude stays approximately constant as a function of rotation, and the
turbulent diffusivity decreases monotonically with increasing rotation. Only
when rotation is rapid enough a large-scale dynamo can be excited. The
one-dimensional mean-field model with dynamo coefficients from the test field
results predicts reasonably well the dynamo excitation in the direct
simulations. This result further validates the test field procedure and
reinforces the interpretation that the observed dynamo is driven by a turbulent
alpha-effect. This result demonstrates the existence of an alpha-effect and an
alpha^2-dynamo with natural forcing.",Astronomy
135,136.0,"We present a complete analysis of the cosmological constraints on decaying
dark matter. Previous analyses have used the cosmic microwave background and
Type Ia supernova. We have updated them with the latest data as well as
extended the analysis with the inclusion of Lyman-$\alpha$ forest, large scale

considered in the present paper. The bounds on the lifetime of decaying dark
matter are dominated by either the late-time integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect for
the scenario with weak reionization, or CMB polarization observations when
there is significant reionization. For the respective scenarios, the lifetimes
for decaying dark matter are $\Gamma^{-1} \gtrsim 100$ Gyr and $ (f \Gamma)
^{-1} \gtrsim 5.3 \times 10^8$ Gyr (at 95.4% confidence level), where the
phenomenological parameter $f$ is the fraction of the decay energy deposited in
baryonic gas. This allows us to constrain particle physics models with dark
matter candidates through investigation of dark matter decays into Standard
Model particles via effective operators. For decaying dark matter of $\sim 100$
GeV mass, we found that the size of the coupling constant in the effective

strengthen rapidly with time. Based on the observed spectral characteristics,
both objects are classified as He/N novae. We have investigated the possibility
of V2491 Cyg being a recurrent nova as has been suggested. By studying the
temporal evolution of the line widths in V2491 Cyg it appears unlikely that the
binary companion is a giant star with heavy wind as in recurrent novae of the

the HI lines, in both novae, are optically thick during the span of our
observations. The slope of the continuum spectra in both cases was found to
have a \lambda^-(3-3.5) dependence which deviates from a Rayleigh-Jeans
spectral distribution. Both novae were detected in the post-outburst super-soft

139,140.0,"After considering the effects of negative feedback on the process of star
formation, we explore the relationship between star formation process and the
associated feedback, by investigating how the mechanical feedback from
supernovae(SNe) and radiative feedback from luminous objects regulate the star
formation rate and therefore affect the cosmic reionization.Based on our
present knowledge of the negative feedback theory and some numerical
simulations, we construct an analytic model in the framework of the Lambda cold
dark matter model. In certain parameter regions, our model can explain some
observational results properly. In large halos(T_vir&gt;10000 K), both mechanical
and radiative feedback have a similar behavior: the relative strength of
negative feedback reduces as the redshift decreases. In contrast, in small
halos (T_vir&lt;10000 K$) that are thought to breed the first stars at early time,
the radiative feedback gets stronger when the redshift decreases. And the star
formation rate in these small halos depends very weakly on the star-formation
efficiency. Our results show that the radiative feedback is important for the
early generation stars. It can suppress the star formation rate considerably.
But the mechanical feedback from the SNe explosions is not able to affect the
early star formation significantly. The early star formation in small-halo
objects is likely to be self-regulated. The radiative and mechanical feedback
dominates the star formation rate of the PopII/I stars all along. The feedback
from first generation stars is very strong and should not be neglected.
However, their effects on the cosmic reionization are not significant, which
results in a small contribution to the optical depth of Thomson scattering.",Astronomy

the system to understand peculiarities of DI UMa, and other active cataclysmic
variables. Based on precise photometric measurements, temporal light curve
behaviour, O-C analysis, and power spectrum analysis, we investigated physical
parameters of the system. We found that the period of the supercycle now equals
31.45 +/-0.3 days. Observations during superoutbursts infer that the period of
superhumps equals P_sh = 0.055318(11) days (79.66 +/- 0.02 min). During
quiescence, the light curve reveals a modulation of period P_orb = 0.054579(6)
days (78.59 +/- 0.01 min), which we interpret as the orbital period of the

excess of 1.35% +/- 0.02%, which is surprisingly small compared to the usual

been transformed into translational kinetic energy. The resulting velocity can
be an order unity fraction of the speed of light. This process results from the

boundary of an accretion disc. Observations indicate that some of the
quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) observed in the luminosities of accreting
compact objects (neutron stars, black holes and white dwarfs) are produced in
the inner-most regions of accretion discs or boundary layers. Two simple models
are considered in this paper: The magnetosphere-disc model consists of a thin
Keplerian disc in contact with a uniformly rotating magnetosphere with and low
plasma density, while the star-disc model involves a Keplerian disc terminated
at the stellar atomosphere with high density and small density scale height. We
find that the interface modes at the magnetosphere-disc boundary are generally
unstable due to Rayleigh-Taylor and/or Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities. However,
differential rotation of the disc tends to suppress Rayleigh-Taylor instability
and a sufficiently high disc sound speed (or temperature) is needed to overcome
this suppression and to attain net mode growth. On the other hand,
Kelvin-Helmholtz instability may be active at low disc sound speeds. We also
find that the interface modes trapped at the boundary between a thin disc and
an unmagnetized star do not suffer Rayleigh-Taylor or Kelvin-Helmholtz
instability, but can become unstable due to wave leakage to large disc radii
and, for sufficiently steep disc density distributions, due to wave absorption
at the corotation resonance in the disc. The non-axisymmetric interface modes

conventionally implemented as an upper cut-off in energy space -- particles are
then permitted to escape from any part of the system, once their energy exceeds
this limit. However, because accelerated particles are responsible for
substantial amplification of the ambient magnetic field in a region upstream of
the shock front, we examine an alternative approach in which particles escape
over a spatial boundary. We use a simple iterative scheme that constructs
stationary numerical solutions to the coupled kinetic and hydrodynamic

stationary solutions with efficient acceleration when the escape boundary is

160,161.0,"If the accelerated expansion of the Universe at the present epoch is driven
by a dark energy scalar field, there may well be a non-trivial coupling between
the dark energy and the cold dark matter (CDM) fluid. Such interactions give
rise to new features in cosmological structure growth, like an additional
long-range attractive force between CDM particles, or variations of the dark
matter particle mass with time. We have implemented these effects in the N-body
code GADGET-2 and present results of a series of high-resolution N-body
simulations where the dark energy component is directly interacting with the
cold dark matter. As a consequence of the new physics, CDM and baryon
distributions evolve differently both in the linear and in the nonlinear regime
of structure formation. Already on large scales a linear bias develops between
these two components, which is further enhanced by the nonlinear evolution. We
also find, in contrast with previous work, that the density profiles of CDM
halos are less concentrated in coupled dark energy cosmologies compared with
LCDM, and that this feature does not depend on the initial conditions setup,
but is a specific consequence of the extra physics induced by the coupling.
Also, the baryon fraction in halos in the coupled models is significantly
reduced below the universal baryon fraction. These features alleviate tensions
between observations and the LCDM model on small scales. Our methodology is
ideally suited to explore the predictions of coupled dark energy models in the
fully non-linear regime, which can provide powerful constraints for the viable
parameter space of such scenarios.",Astronomy

photometer consists of seven photomultiplier tube pixels: a central one to
monitor the target and a surrounding ring of six pixels to veto background
events. The light curves of all pixels were recorded continuously and were
searched offline with a matched-filtering technique for flares with a duration
of 2 us to 100 ms. As expected, many unresolved (&lt;3 us) and many long (&gt;500 us)
background events originating in the earth's atmosphere were detected. In the
time range 3 to 500 us the measurement is essentially background-free, with
only eight events detected in 43 h; five from lightning and three presumably
from a piece of space debris. The detection of flashes of brightness ~ 0.1 Jy

particular focus on black hole luminosities below the Eddington limit as
observed in many local AGN. For such luminosities, up to 20% of high-redshift
black holes can be active quasars. We then discuss the observables of
high-redshift black holes for ALMA and JWST by adopting NGC 1068 as a reference
system. We calculate the expected flux of different fine-structure lines for a
similar system at higher redshift, and provide further predictions for high-J
CO lines. We discuss the expected fluxes from stellar light, the AGN continuum

used to derive detailed properties of high-redshift sources. We suggest two
observational strategies to find potential AGN at high redshift and estimate
the expected number of sources, which is between 1-10 for ALMA with a field of
view of $\sim(1')^2$ searching for line emission and 100-1000 for JWST with a

lensed galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) imaging data. In this

reported by Honma et al., 2003 (hereafter A2003). Independently we checked the
archival data and found the features noted in A2003 were not from the effect of
phase referencing by simultaneous differential VLBI but mainly from a removal
of large phase change by subtracting an arbitrary fitted curve to the phase
variations.
  The differential phase of the observed H2O masers between W49 North (W49N)

sidereal day due to a positional offset from the real celestial positions. We
therefore could not reproduce the results in A2003 by a normal positional
correction estimated from all time data, but could reproduce almost the same
phases only for the first hour by adjusting parameters. Using the parameters,
we could not suppress the large amount of phase variations for the successive
time data that A2003 did not show in their paper.
  It is appropriate to regard the analysis in A2003 as not being proper for
showing the performance of the instrument for phase referencing, which should
be demonstrated by other experiments observing several pairs of continuum

170,171.0,"The measurement of the gravitational lens delay time between light paths has
relied, to date, on the source having sufficient variability to allow
photometric variations from each path to be compared. However, the delay times
of many gravitational lenses cannot be measured because the intrinsic source
amplitude variations are too small to be detectable. At the fundamental quantum
mechanical level, such photometric time stamps allow which-path knowledge,
removing the ability to obtain an interference pattern. However, if the two
paths can be made equal (zero time delay) then interference can occur. We
describe an interferometric approach to measuring gravitational lens delay
times using a quantum-eraser/restorer approach, whereby the time travel along
the two paths may be rendered measurably equal. Energy and time being
non-commuting observables, constraints on the photon energy in the energy-time
uncertainty principle, via adjustments of the width of the radio bandpass,
dictate the uncertainty of the time delay and therefore whether the path taken
along one or the other gravitational lens geodesic is knowable. If one starts
with interference, for example, which-path information returns when the
bandpass is broadened (constraints on the energy are relaxed) to the point
where the uncertainty principle allows a knowledge of the arrival time to
better than the gravitational lens delay time itself, at which point the
interference will disappear. We discuss the near-term feasibility of such
measurements in light of current narrow-band radio detectors and known short
time-delay gravitational lenses.",Astronomy

characteristics of the jets to explore the influence of the nature of jets on
the structure of the supernova ejecta. We evolve the explosions past
shock-breakout and into quasi-homologous expansion of the supernova envelope
into a red supergiant wind. The oppositely-directed, nickel-rich jets give a
large-scale asymmetry that may account for the non-spherical excitation and
substructure of spectral lines such as H$\alpha$ and He I 10830\AA. Jets with a
large fraction of kinetic to thermal energy punch through the progenitor
envelope and give rise to explosions that would be observed to be asymmetric
from the earliest epochs, inconsistent with spectropolarimetric measurements of
Type II supernovae. Jets with higher thermal energy fractions result in
explosions that are roughly spherical at large radii but are significantly
elongated at smaller radii, deep inside the ejecta, in agreement with the
polarimetric observations. We present shock breakout light curves that indicate
that strongly aspherical shock breakouts are incompatible with recent {\it
GALEX} observations of shock breakout from red supergiant stars. Comparison
with observations indicates that jets must deposit their kinetic energy
efficiently throughout the ejecta while in the hydrogen envelope. Thermal

conversion into radiate output. Since their seminal paper, broadband
observations of quasars and black hole X-ray binaries insist that the SS73
prescription cannot wholly describe their behavior. In particular, optically
thick black hole accretion flows are almost universally accompanied by coronae
whose relative power by far exceeds anything seen in studies of stellar
chromospheric and coronal activity. In this note, we briefly discuss the
possible repercussions of freeing accretion models of GRBs from the SS73

174,175.0,"Large-scale radial transport of solids appears to be a fundamental
consequence of protoplanetary disk evolution based on the presence of high

radionuclides were introduced to the terrestrial planet region and the cause of
the variations in oxygen isotope ratios seen in primitive materials. Here, both
outward and inward transport of solids are investigated in the context of a
two-dimensional, viscously evolving protoplanetary disk. The dynamics of solids
are investigated to determine how they depend on particle size and the
particular stage of protoplanetary disk evolution, corresponding to different
rates of mass transport. It is found that the outward flows that arise around
the disk midplane of a protoplanetary disk aid in the outward transport of
solids up to the size of CAIs and can increase the crystallinity fraction of
silicate dust at 10 AU around a solar mass star to as much as $\sim$40% in the
case of rapidly evolving disks, decreasing as the accretion rate onto the star
slows. High velocity, inward flows along the disk surface aid in the rapid
transport of solids from the outer disk to the inner disk, particularly for
small dust. Despite the diffusion that occurs throughout the disk, the
large-scale, meridonal flows associated with mass transport prevent complete
homogenization of the disk, allowing compositional gradients to develop that
vary in intensity for a timescale of one million years.",Astronomy

can lead to a cold dark matter (CDM) dominated, accelerating Universe (Lima et

creation driven cosmological models are capable of accounting for the SNIa

Universe. Here we test the evolution of such models at high redshift using the
constraint on z_eq, the redshift of the epoch of matter radiation equality,
provided by the WMAP constraints on the early Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect.
Since the contribution of baryons and radiation was ignored in the work of LSS,
we include them in our study of this class of models. The parameters of these
more realistic models with continuous creation of CDM is tested and constrained
at widely-separated epochs (z = z_eq and z = 0) in the evolution of the

836 eclipsing binaries that display coronal activity and is the largest sample
of active binary stars assembled to date. By using the (V-I) colors of the ASAS
eclipsing binary catalogue, we are able to determine the distances and thus
bolometric luminosities for the majority of eclipsing binaries that display
significant stellar activity. A typical value for the ratio of soft X-ray to
bolometric luminosity is L_X/L_bol ~ a few x 10^-4, similar to the ratio of
soft X-ray to bolometric flux F_X/F_bol in the most active regions of the Sun.
Unlike rapidly rotating isolated late-type dwarfs -- stars with significant
outer convection zones -- a tight correlation between Rossby number and
activity of eclipsing binaries is absent. We find evidence for the saturation
effect and marginal evidence for the so-called ""super-saturation"" phenomena.
Our work shows that wide-field stellar variability searches can produce a high

177,178.0,"We present a parameter study of the magnetohydrodynamical dynamo driven by
cosmic rays in the interstellar medium (ISM) focusing on the efficiency of
magnetic field amplification and the issue of energy equipartition between
magnetic, kinetic and cosmic ray (CR) energies. We perform numerical CR-MHD
simulations of the ISM using the extended version of ZEUS-3D code in the
shearing box approximation and taking into account the presence of Ohmic
resistivity, tidal forces and vertical disk gravity. CRs are supplied in
randomly distributed supernova (SN) remnants and are described by the
diffusion-advection equation, which incorporates an anisotropic diffusion
tensor. The azimuthal magnetic flux and total magnetic energy are amplified
depending on a particular choice of model parameters. We find that the most
favorable conditions for magnetic field amplification correspond to magnetic
diffusivity of the order of $3\times 10^{25} \cm^2\s^{-1}$, SN rates close to
those observed in the Milky Way, periodic SN activity corresponding to spiral
arms, and highly anisotropic and field-aligned CR diffusion. The rate of
magnetic field amplification is relatively insensitive to the magnitude of SN
rates in a rage of spanning 10% up to 100% of realistic values. The timescale
of magnetic field amplification in the most favorable conditions is 150 Myr, at
galactocentric radius equal to 5 kpc. The final magnetic field energies
fluctuate near equipartition with the gas kinetic energy. In all models CR
energy exceeds the equipartition values by a least an order of magnitude, in
contrary to the expected equipartition. We suggest that the excess of cosmic

178,179.0,"We use dissipationless N-body simulations to investigate the evolution of the
true coarse-grained phase-space density distribution f(x,v) in equal-mass
mergers between dark matter (DM) halos. The halo models are constructed with
various asymptotic power-law indices ranging from steep cusps to core-like
profiles and we employ the phase-space density estimator ``Enbid'' developed by
Sharma &amp; Steinmetz to compute f(x,v). The adopted force resolution allows
robust phase-space density profile estimates in the inner ~1% of the virial
radii of the simulated systems. We confirm that mergers result in a decrease of
the coarse-grained phase-space density in accordance with expectations from
Mixing Theorems for collisionless systems. We demonstrate that binary mergers
between identical DM halos produce remnants that retain excellent memories of
the inner slopes and overall shapes of the phase-space density distribution of
their progenitors. The robustness of the phase-space density profiles holds for
a range of orbital energies, and a variety of encounter configurations
including sequences of several consecutive merger events, designed to mimic
hierarchical merging, and collisions occurring at different cosmological
epochs. If the progenitor halos are constructed with appreciably different
asymptotic power-law indices, we find that the inner slope and overall shape of
the phase-space density distribution of the remnant are substantially closer to
that of the initial system with the steepest central density cusp. These
results explicitly demonstrate that mixing is incomplete in equal-mass mergers

179,180.0,"The possibility of explaining the positron and electron excess recently found
by the PAMELA and ATIC collaborations in terms of dark matter (DM) annihilation
has attracted considerable attention. Models surviving bounds from, e.g,
antiproton production generally fall into two classes, where either DM
annihilates directly with a large branching fraction into light leptons, or, as
in the recent models of Arkani-Hamed et al., and of Nomura and Thaler, the
annihilation gives low-mass (pseudo)scalars or vectors $\phi$ which then decay
into $\mu^+\mu^-$ or $e^+e^-$. While the constraints on the first kind of
models have recently been treated by several authors, we study here
specifically models of the second type which rely on an efficient Sommerfeld
enhancement in order to obtain the necessary boost in the annihilation cross
section. We compute the photon flux generated by QED radiative corrections to
the decay of $\phi$ and show that this indeed gives a rather spectacular broad
peak in $E^2d\sigma/dE$, that for these extreme values of the cross section
violate gamma-ray observations of the Galactic center for DM density profiles
steeper than that of Navarro, Frenk and White. The most stringent constraint
comes from the comparison of the predicted synchrotron radiation in the central
part of the Galaxy with radio observations of Sgr A*. For the most commonly

been analyzed. The ionized region is clearly detected in the optical and in the
radio continuum images. The analysis of the HI data shows a region of low
emissivity that has an excellent morphological correlation with the radio
continuum emission. The HII region is partially bordered by a photodissociation
region, which, in turn, is encircled by a molecular structure. Taking into
account the presence of noncircular motions in the Perseus spiral arm, together
with previous distance estimates for the region, we adopt a distance of 2.5 +-
0.5 kpc for Sh2-173. Seven hot stars were identified in the field of Sh2-173,
being only one an O-type star. The amount of energetic photons emitted by this
star is enough to keep the region ionized and heat the dust. Given that an
expanding HII region may trigger star formation, a search for YSO candidates
was made using different infrared point source catalogues. A population of 46
YSO candidates was identified projected onto the molecular clouds. On the other
hand, Sh2-173 is located in a dense edge of a large HI shell. The possibility
for Sh2-173 of being part of a hierarchical system of three generations is
suggested. The ages of both, the HII region and the large shell, were estimated
and compared. We concluded that Sh2-173 is a young HII region of about 0.6 -
1.0 Myr old. As for the large shell we obtained a dynamical age of 5 +- 1 Myr.
These age estimates, together with the relative location of the different

five other publicly available photo-z codes (HyperZ, SDSS, Le PHARE, BPZ and
ZEBRA) for ~1.5 million Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs) in SDSS DR6. This allows
us to identify how reliable codes are relative to each other if used as
described in their public release. We compare and contrast the relative merits
of each code using ~13000 spectroscopic redshifts from the 2SLAQ sample. We
find that the performance of each code depends on the figure of merit used to
assess it. As expected, the availability of a complete training set means that
the training method performs best in the intermediate redshift bins where there
are plenty of training objects. Codes such as Le PHARE, which use new observed
templates perform best in the lower redshift bins. All codes produce reasonable
photometric redshifts, the 1-sigma scatters ranging from 0.057 to 0.097 if
averaged over the entire redshift range. We also perform tests to check whether
a training set from a small region of the sky such as 2SLAQ produces biases if
used to train over a larger area of the sky. We conclude that this is not

at least up to mm sizes in their circumstellar disks. CS Cha has similar
indications for grain growth in its circumbinary disk. The T Tauri stars WW Cha

ATCA. The new ATCA 7 mm system was also used to observe CS Cha. WW Cha was

Cha at 3 cm and upper limits only at 6 cm. The emission at 16 mm was stable
over days, months and years, but the emission at 3 cm is found to be variable.
RU Lup was detected at 7 mm. It was observed at 16 mm 3 times and at 3 and 6 cm
4 times and found to be variable in all 3 wavebands. CS Cha was detected at 7
mm, but the S/N was too low to resolve the gap in the circumbinary disk. The
emission at 3, 7 and 16 mm for WW Cha is well explained by thermal emission
from mm and cm-sized pebbles. The cm spectral index is consistent with the
emission from an optically-thick ionised wind, but the high variability of the
cm emission points to a non-thermal contribution. The SEDs of RU Lup and CS Cha

affected by the convection treatment, extending any calibration to
metallicities different from solar one is very artificial, in the absence of
any calibrators for the convective parameters. For solar abundance, Mixing
Lenght Theory models have been calibrated by using the results of 2D

187,188.0,"Context. The IUE database provides a large number of UV high and
low-resolution spectra of RS CVn-type stars from 1978 to 1996. In particular,
many of these stars were monitored continuously during several seasons by IUE.
Aims. Our main purpose is to study the short and long-term chromospheric
activity of the RS CVn systems most observed by IUE: HD 22468 (V711 Tau, HR
1099, K1IV+G5V), HD 21242 (UX Ari, K0IV+G5V) and HD 224085 (II Peg, K2IV).
Methods. We first obtain the Mount Wilson index S from the IUE high and
low-resolution spectra. Secondly, we analyse with the Lomb-Scargle periodogram
the mean annual index S and the amplitude of its rotational modulation.
Results. For HD 22468 (V711 Tau, HR 1099), we found a possible chromospheric
cycle with a period of 18 years and a shorter cycle with a period of 3 years,
which could be associated to a chromospheric ""flip-flop"" cycle. The data of HD
224085 (II Peg) also suggest a chromospheric cycle of 21 years and a flip-flop
cycle of 9 years. Finally, we obtained a possible chromospheric cycle of 7
years for HD 21242 (UX Ari).",Astronomy
188,189.0,"We present calculations of the heliospheric SWCX emission spectra and their
contributions in the ROSAT 1/4 keV band. We compare our results with the soft
X-ray diffuse background (SXRB) emission detected in front of 378 identified
shadowing regions during the ROSAT All-Sky Survey (Snowden et al. 2000). This
foreground component is principally attributed to the hot gas of the so-called
Local Bubble (LB), an irregularly shaped cavity of ~50-150 pc around the Sun,
which is supposed to contain ~10^6 K plasma. Our results suggest that the SWCX
emission from the heliosphere is bright enough to account for most of the
foreground emission towards the majority of low galactic latitude directions,
where the LB is the least extended. In a large part of directions with galactic
latitude above 30deg the heliospheric SWCX intensity is significantly smaller
than the measured one. However, the SWCX R2/R1 band ratio differs slightly from
the data in the galactic center direction, and more significantly in the
galactic anti-centre direction where the observed ratio is the smallest.
Assuming that both SWCX and hot gas emission are present and their relative
contributions vary with direction, we tested a series of thermal plasma spectra
for temperatures ranging from 10^5 to 10^6.5 K and searched for a combination
of SWCX spectra and thermal emission matching the observed intensities and band
ratios, while simultaneously being compatible with O VI emission measurements.
In the frame of collisional equilibrium models and for solar abundances, the
range we derive for hot gas temperature and emission measure cannot reproduce
the Wisconsin C/B band ratio. We emphasize the need for additional atomic data,
describing consistently EUV and X-ray photon spectra of the charge-exchange
emission of heavier solar wind ions.",Astronomy

Remarkably, notwithstanding the absence of energetically-important envelope
convection, we observe very strong (from 300 G to 30 kG) and organised (mainly
dipolar) magnetic fields in a few percent of the A and B-type stars on the MS,

the opposite hemisphere consistent with the previously detected direction of

Besides, spectrum extraction requires regions with large statistics while maps
in energy bands allow only qualitative interpretation. The two main competing
mechanisms in the VHE domain are the Inverse-Compton emission from accelerated
electrons radiating through synchrotron in the X-ray domain and the
interactions between accelerated hadrons and the surrounding medium, leading to
the production and subsequent decay of Pi0 mesons. The spectrum of the VHE
emission from leptons is predicted to steepen with increasing distance from the
acceleration zone, owing to synchrotron losses (i.e. cooled population). It
would remain approximately constant for hadrons. Ideally, spectro-imaging
analysis would have the same spatial scale in the TeV and X-ray domains, to
distinguish the local emission mechanisms. More realistically, we investigate

available, which makes a detailed abundance analysis both more interesting and
more precise than for isolated stars. We have reconstructed the spectra of the
individual components of V453 Cyg from the observed composite spectra using the
technique of spectral disentangling. From these disentangled spectra we have
obtained improved effective temperature measurements of 27900 +/- 400 K and
26200 +/- 500 K, for the primary and secondary stars respectively, by fitting
non-LTE theoretical line profiles to the hydrogen Balmer lines. Armed with
these high-precision effective temperatures and the accurately known surface
gravities of the stars we have obtained the abundances of helium and metallic
elements. A detailed abundance analysis of the primary star shows a normal
(solar) helium abundance if the microturbulence velocity derived from metallic
lines is used. The elemental abundances show no indication that CNO-processed
material is present in the photosphere of this high-mass terminal age main

results. We have attempted to constrain the physical properties of the binary

period of the system slowly changes though we are unable to discriminate
between several possible explanations of this trend. The best fit solution of
the continuum light curve reveals a contact configuration with the secondary
star being significantly brighter and hotter on its leading side facing the
primary. The mean temperature of the secondary star turns out to be only
slightly lower than that of the primary, whilst the bolometric luminosity ratio
is found to be 3.1. The solution of the light curve yields a distance of 925
+/- 25 pc much lower than the usually assumed distance of the Cyg OB2
association. Whilst we confirm the existence of episodes of higher X-ray
fluxes, the data reveal no phase-locked modulation with the 6.6 day period of
the eclipsing binary nor any clear relation between the X-ray flux and the 6.7
yr radio cycle. The bright region of the secondary star is probably heated by
energy transfer in a common envelope in this contact binary system as well as
by the collision with the primary's wind. The existence of a common photosphere
probably also explains the odd mass-luminosity relation of the stars in this

of Cyg OB2 #5 is likely to arise from the interaction of the combined wind of

cores or extended emission. The H2 jets are widely distributed and randomly
orientated; the jets do not appear to be orthogonal to large-scale filaments or
even to the small-scale cores. Moreover, H2 jet lengths and opening angles are
not obviously correlated with indicators of outflow source age - source
spectral index or (sub)millimetre core flux. We demonstrate that H2 jet sources
are predominantly protostellar with flat or positive spectral indices, rather
than disk-excess (or T Tauri) stars. Most protostars in molecular cores drive
H2 outflows. However, not all molecular cores are associated with protostars or
H2 jets. On statistical grounds, the H2 jet phase may be marginally shorter
than the protostellar phase, though must be considerably shorter than the
prestellar phase. In terms of their spectral index, H2 jet sources are
indistinguishable from protostars. The few true protostars without H2 jets are
almost certainly more evolved than their H2-jet-driving counterparts. We also
find that protostars that power molecular outflows are no more (nor no less)
clustered than protostars that do not. The H2 emission regions in outflows from
young stars clearly weaken and fade very quickly, before the source evolves

Parker instability. We have carried out global three-dimensional
magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of the gas disk in the Galactic center. The
gravitational potential is approximated by the axisymmetric potential proposed
by Miyamoto &amp; Nagai (1975). At the initial state, we assume a warm (~ 10^4 K)
gas torus threaded by azimuthal magnetic fields. Self-gravity and radiative
cooling of the gas are ignored. We found that buoyantly rising magnetic loops
are formed above the differentially rotating, magnetically turbulent disk. By
analyzing the results of global MHD simulations, we have identified individual
loops, about 180 in the upper half of the disk, and studied their statistical
properties such as their length, width, height, and velocity distributions
along the loops. Typical length and height of a loop are 1kpc and 200pc,
respectively. The line of sight velocity changes linearly along a loop and

case where the neutron superfluid and normal fluid are decoupled, and with each
fluid modeled by a polytropic equation of state. We find that the $f_{\rm

orindary-fluid stars. However, the oscillation frequency of the $f_{\rm

a homogenous two-fluid stellar model in Newtonian gravity. Next the coupling
effect between the two fluids is studied via a parameterized model of
entrainment. We find that the coupling in general breaks the universal behavior

216,217.0,"A white dwarf (WD) approaching the Chandrasekhar mass may in several cases
undergo accretion-induced collapse (AIC) to a neutron star (NS) before a
thermonuclear explosion ensues. It has generally been assumed that AIC does not
produce a detectable supernova (SN). If, however, the progenitor WD is rapidly
rotating (as may be expected due to its prior accretion), a centrifugally
supported disk forms around the NS upon collapse. We calculate the subsequent
evolution of this accretion disk using time-dependent height-integrated
simulations with initial conditions taken from the AIC calculations of Dessart
et al. (2006). Initially, the disk is cooled by neutrinos and its composition
is driven neutron-rich (electron fraction Ye ~ 0.1) by electron captures.
However, as the disk viscously spreads, it is irradiated by neutrinos from the
central proto-NS, which dramatically alters its neutron-to-proton ratio. We
find that electron neutrino captures increase Ye to ~ 0.5 by the time that weak
interactions in the disk freeze out. Because the disk becomes radiatively
inefficient and begins forming alpha-particles soon after freeze out, powerful
winds blow away most of the disk's remaining mass. These Ye ~ 0.5 outflows
synthesize up to a few times 1e-2 Msun in 56Ni. As a result, AIC may be
accompanied by a radioactively powered SN-like transient that peaks on a
timescale of ~ 1 day. Since few intermediate mass elements are likely
synthesized, these Ni-rich explosions should be spectroscopically distinct from
other SNe. PanSTARRs and the Palomar Transient Factory should detect a few AIC
transients per year if their true rate is ~1/100 of the Type Ia rate, and LSST
should detect hundreds per year. High cadence observations (&lt; 1 day) are
optimal for the detection and follow-up of AIC (abridged).",Astronomy

calculations to determine the relationship between reionization history and
local environment in a volume 1 Gpc/h across and a resolution of about 1 Mpc.
We resolve the formation of about 2x10^6 halos of mass greater than ~10^12 Msun
at z=0, allowing us to determine the relationship between halo mass and
reionization epoch for galaxies and clusters. For our fiducial reionization
model, in which reionization begins at z~15 and ends by z~6, we find a strong
bias for cluster-size halos to be in the regions which reionized first, at
redshifts 10&lt;z&lt;15. Consequently, material in clusters was reionized within
relatively small regions, on the order of a few Mpc, implying that all clusters
in our calculation were reionized by their own progenitors. Milky Way mass
halos were on average reionized later and by larger regions, with a
distribution similar to the global one, indicating that low mass halos are
relatively uncorrelated with reionization when only their mass is taken as a
prior. On average, we find that most halos with mass less than 10^13 Msun were
reionized internally, while almost all halos with masses greater than 10^14
Msun were reionized by their own progenitors. We briefly discuss the
implications of this work in light of the ""missing satellites"" problem and how
this new approach may be extended further.",Astronomy

obtaining the evolution of \delta_e for comoving wavenumbers smaller than
1Mpc^{-1}. We calculate rigorously the perturbations to the Ly\alpha escape
probability and show that to a good approximation it is governed by the local
baryon velocity divergence. For modes shorter than the photon diffusion scale,
we find that \delta_e is enhanced during recombination by a factor of roughly 5

that 9 of the objects have spiral arms that extend to the outer Lindblad

ellipsoidal variations by means of measuring brightness of the star distorted

discussed by Phafl et al. (2008) and earlier by Loeb and Gaudi (2003). The
effect is well known in the case of binary stars where it can produce light
curves with amplitutudes of ellipsoidal variations of about 0.1 mag for
distorted stars. For planets the effect is very small and usually less than
0.0001 mag. The detection of an exoplanet, by searching for small amplitude
ellipsoidal variations, will be very difficult and affected by other
photometric effects; however, it maybe possible for some extreme cases.
Observations of ellipsoidal variations can provide additional constraints on
the model of the system. Light curves for few star/planet systems have been
calculated using PHOEBE eclipsing binary software based on Wilson-Devinney

222,223.0,"We perform SPH simulations of the collapse and fragmentation of low-mass
cores having different initial levels of turbulence
(alpha_turb=0.05,0.10,0.25). We use a new treatment of the energy equation
which captures the transport of cooling radiation against opacity due to both
dust and gas (including the effects of dust sublimation, molecules, and H^-
ions). We also perform comparison simulations using a standard barotropic
equation of state. We find that -- when compared with the barotropic equation
of state -- our more realistic treatment of the energy equation results in more
protostellar objects being formed, and a higher proportion of brown dwarfs; the
multiplicity frequency is essentially unchanged, but the multiple systems tend
to have shorter periods (by a factor ~3), higher eccentricities, and higher
mass ratios. The reason for this is that small fragments are able to cool more
effectively with the new treatment, as compared with the barotropic equation of
state. We find that the process of fragmentation is often bimodal. The first
protostar to form is usually, at the end, the most massive, i.e. the primary.
However, frequently a disc-like structure subsequently forms round this
primary, and then, once it has accumulated sufficient mass, quickly fragments
to produce several secondaries. We believe that this delayed fragmentation of a
disc-like structure is likely to be an important source of very low-mass
hydrogen-burning stars and brown dwarfs.",Astronomy

observed by Chandra/HETG and resulted in high signal-to-noise grating spectra,

outflows. Using a novel scheme to model the physics and spectral signatures of
gaseous winds from these objects, we are able to estimate the mass loss rates
and kinetic luminosities associated with the highly ionized gas and investigate
its physical properties. Our conclusions are as follows: 1) There is a strong
indication that the outflowing gas in those objects is multi-phase with similar
kinematics for the different phases. 2) The X-ray spectrum is consistent with
such flows being thermally driven from ~pc scales, and are therefore unlikely
to be associated with the inner accretion disk. 3) The underlying X-ray
spectrum consists of a hard X-ray powerlaw which is similar for all objects
shining below their Eddington rate and a soft excess whose contribution becomes
more prominent for objects shining close to their Eddington limit. 4) The
physical properties of the outflow are similar in all cases and a coherent
picture emerges concerning its physical properties. 5) The deduced mass loss
rates are, roughly, of the order of the mass accretion rate in those objects so
that the kinetic luminosity carried by such winds is only a tiny fraction

cluster. Our observations do not show significant radio emission from the
mini-halo, hence we present upper limits to the integrated, diffuse non-thermal
radio emission of the core of the Ophiuchus cluster. The XMM-Newton
observations can be well explained by a two-temperature thermal model with
temperatures of ~=1.8 keV and ~=9.0 keV, respectively, which confirms previous
results that suggest that the innermost central region of the Ophiuchus cluster
is a cooling core. We also used the XMM-Newton data to set up an upper limit to
the (non-thermal) X-ray emission from the cluster.
  The combination of available radio and X-ray data has strong implications for
the currently proposed models of the spectral energy distribution (SED) from
the Ophiuchus cluster. In particular, a synchrotron+IC model is in agreement
with the currently available data, if the average magnetic field is in the
range (0.02-0.3) microG. A pure WIMP annihilation scenario can in principle
reproduce both radio and X-ray emission, but at the expense of postulating very
large boost factors from dark matter substructures, jointly with extremely low
values of the average magnetic field. Finally, a scenario where synchrotron and
inverse Compton emission arise from PeV electron-positron pairs (via

a response to the Lorentz force that naturally occurs as bipolar magnetic
fields emerge and expand in a gravitationally stratified atmosphere. It will be
shown that shearing motions transport axial flux, and magnetic energy from the

solar interior to the corona. This physical process explains active region
shear flows and why the magnetic field is found to be nearly parallel to
photospheric polarity inversion lines where prominences form. Finally, shear

directly measure the Universe expansion history, and to set limits to space
curvature when combined to the angular BAO signal. In addition to spectroscopic
surveys, radial BAO might be measured from accurate enough photometric
redshifts obtained with narrow-band filters. We explore the requirements for a
photometric survey using Luminous Red Galaxies (LRG) to competitively measure
the radial BAO signal and discuss the possible systematic errors of this
approach. If LRG were a highly homogeneous population, we show that the photo-z
accuracy would not substantially improve by increasing the number of filters
beyond $\sim 10$, except for a small fraction of the sources detected at high
signal-to-noise, and broad-band filters would suffice to achieve the target
$\sigma_z = 0.003 (1+z)$ for measuring radial BAO. Using the LRG spectra
obtained from SDSS, we find that the spectral variability of LRG substantially
worsens the achievable photometric redshift errors, and that the optimal system
consists of $\sim$ 30 filters of width $\Delta \lambda / \lambda \sim 0.02$. A
$S/N &gt; 20$ is generally necessary at the filters on the red side of the
$H\alpha$ break to reach the target photometric accuracy. We estimate that a
5-year survey in a dedicated telescope with etendue in excess of 60 ${\rm m}^2
{\rm deg}^2$ would be necessary to obtain a high enough density of galaxies to
measure radial BAO with sufficiently low shot noise up to $z= 0.85$. We

We consider perturbations of Newtonian axisymmetric background configurations

evolutions for uniformly rotating stars up to the mass-shedding limit. This
leads to the first detailed analysis of superfluid neutron star oscillations in
the fast rotation regime, where the star is significantly deformed by the
centrifugal force. For simplicity, we focus on background models where the two
fluids (superfluid neutrons and protons) co-rotate, are in beta-equilibrium and
coexist throughout the volume of the star. We construct sequences of rotating
stars for two analytical model equations of state. These models represent
relatively simple generalisations of single fluid, polytropic stars. We study
the effects of entrainment, rotation and symmetry energy on non-radial

233,234.0,"In the next years, several cosmological surveys will rely on imaging data to
estimate the redshift of galaxies, using traditional filter systems with 4-5
optical broad bands; narrower filters improve the spectral resolution, but
strongly reduce the total system throughput. We explore how photometric
redshift performance depends on the number of filters n_f, characterizing the
survey depth through the fraction of galaxies with unambiguous redshift
estimates. For a combination of total exposure time and telescope imaging area
of 270 hrs m^2, 4-5 filter systems perform significantly worse, both in
completeness depth and precision, than systems with n_f &gt;= 8 filters. Our
results suggest that for low n_f, the color-redshift degeneracies overwhelm the
improvements in photometric depth, and that even at higher n_f, the effective
photometric redshift depth decreases much more slowly with filter width than
naively expected from the reduction in S/N. Adding near-IR observations
improves the performance of low n_f systems, but still the system which
maximizes the photometric redshift completeness is formed by 9 filters with
logarithmically increasing bandwidth (constant resolution) and half-band

This estimate is typically derived assuming a standard recombination scheme;
additional radiation sources can delay recombination altering the cosmic
ionization history and the cosmological inferences drawn from CMB and BAO data.
In this paper we quantify the effect of delayed recombination on the
determination of dark energy parameters from future BAO surveys such as BOSS
and WFMOS. We find the impact to be small but still not negligible. In
particular, if recombination is non-standard (to a level still allowed by CMB
data), but this is ignored, future surveys may incorrectly suggest the presence
of a redshift dependent dark energy component. On the other hand, in the case
of delayed recombination, adding to the analysis one extra parameter describing
deviations from standard recombination, does not significantly degrade the
error-bars on dark energy parameters and yields unbiased estimates.",Astronomy

strongly between competing models of perturbation generation in the early

spectrum as deviating slightly from scale invariance with a spectral tilt
parameter of n_s ~ 0.96. Nonetheless, many attempts have been made to isolate
further features such as breaks and cutoffs using a variety of methods, some
employing more than ~ 10 varying parameters. In this paper we apply the robust
technique of Bayesian model selection to reconstruct the optimal degree of
structure in the spectrum. We model the spectrum simply and generically as
piecewise linear in ln k between `nodes' in k-space whose amplitudes are
allowed to vary. The number of nodes and their k-space positions are chosen by
the Bayesian evidence so that we can identify both the complexity and location
of any detected features. Our optimal reconstruction contains, perhaps,
surprisingly few features, the data preferring just three nodes. This
reconstruction allows for a degree of scale dependence of the tilt with the
`turn-over' scale occuring around k ~ 0.016 Mpc^{-1}. More structure is
penalised by the evidence as over-fitting the data, so there is currently
little point in attempting reconstructions that are more complex.",Astronomy

simulations are carried out with the specially developed $\phi$GRAPE code
providing models of clusters of different initial masses, Galactocentric
distances and rotation velocities. The comparison of models and observations of
about 150 clusters reveals ellipticities of observed clusters which are too low
(0.2 vs. 0.3), and offers the basis to find the main reason for this

oblate shape with an axes ratio of $1.65:1.35:1$, and with the major axis
tilted by an angle of $q_{XY} \approx 30^\circ$ with respect to the
Galactocentric radius due to differential rotation of the Galaxy. Unbiased
estimates of cluster shape parameters require reliable membership determination
in large cluster areas up to 2-3 tidal radii where the density of cluster stars
is considerably lower than the background. Although dynamically bound stars
outside the tidal radius contribute insignificantly to the cluster mass, their
distribution is essential for a correct determination of cluster shape

such a dramatic role, though deep surveys allow to identify more cluster

function of local overdensity using the 5th, 10th and 20th nearest neighbors
that cover a range of physical scales (~1-4 Mpc). Overall, we find that AGNs
prefer to reside in environments equivalent to massive galaxies with
substantial levels of star formation. Specifically, AGNs with host masses
between 0.25-1x10^11 Msun span the full range of environments (i.e.,
field-to-group) exhibited by galaxies of the same mass and rest-frame color or
specific star formation rate. Host galaxies having M_*&gt;10^11 Msun clearly
illustrate the association with star formation since they are predominantly
bluer than the underlying galaxy population and exhibit a preference for lower
density regions analogous to SDSS studies of narrow-line AGN. To probe the
environment on smaller physical scales, we determine the fraction of galaxies
(M_*&gt;2.5x10^10 Msun) hosting AGNs inside optically-selected groups, and find no
significant difference with field galaxies. We interpret our results as
evidence that AGN activity requires a sufficient fuel supply; the probability

allowing anti-proton excess due to the absence of the SU(2) singlet quarks. We

modeling in a well-known 3D hydrodynamical model of the solar photosphere shows
remarkable agreement with the empirical data, significantly better than that

that the above-mentioned 3D model was indeed a suitable choice for our

we have paid some attention also to other (more familiar) observables, like the
center-limb variation of the continuum intensity, which we have calculated
taking into account the scattering contribution to the continuum source

out to be impressive, but we find a hint that the model's temperature gradients

244,245.0,"A four-dimensional statistical description of electromagnetic radiation is
developed and applied to the analysis of radio pulsar polarization. The new
formalism provides an elementary statistical explanation of the modal
broadening phenomenon in single pulse observations. It is also used to argue
that the degree of polarization of giant pulses has been poorly defined in past
studies. Single and giant pulse polarimetry typically involves sources with
large flux densities and observations with high time resolution, factors that
necessitate consideration of source-intrinsic noise and small-number
statistics. Self noise is shown to fully explain the excess polarization
dispersion previously noted in single pulse observations of bright pulsars,
obviating the need for additional randomly polarized radiation. Rather, these
observations are more simply interpreted as an incoherent sum of covariant,
orthogonal, partially polarized modes. Based on this premise, the
four-dimensional covariance matrix of the Stokes parameters may be used to
derive mode-separated pulse profiles without any assumptions about the
intrinsic degrees of mode polarization. Finally, utilizing the small-number
statistics of the Stokes parameters, it is established that the degree of
polarization of an unresolved pulse is fundamentally undefined; therefore,
previous claims of highly polarized giant pulses are unsubstantiated.

246,247.0,"We investigate shattering and coagulation of dust grains in turbulent
interstellar medium (ISM). The typical velocity of dust grain as a function of
grain size has been calculated for various ISM phases based on a theory of
grain dynamics in compressible magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. In this paper,
we develop a scheme of grain shattering and coagulation and apply it to
turbulent ISM by using the grain velocities predicted by the above turbulence
theory. Since large grains tend to acquire large velocity dispersions as shown
by earlier studies, large grains tend to be shattered. Large shattering effects
are indeed seen in warm ionized medium (WIM) within a few Myr for grains with
radius $a\ga 10^{-6}$ cm. We also show that shattering in warm neutral medium
(WNM) can limit the largest grain size in ISM ($a\sim 2\times 10^{-5}
\mathrm{cm}$). On the other hand, coagulation tends to modify small grains
since it only occurs when the grain velocity is small enough. Coagulation
significantly modifies the grain size distribution in dense clouds (DC), where
a large fraction of the grains with $a&lt;10^{-6}$ cm coagulate in 10 Myr. In
fact, the correlation among $R_V$, the carbon bump strength, and the
ultraviolet slope in the observed Milky Way extinction curves can be explained
by the coagulation in DC. It is possible that the grain size distribution in
the Milky Way is determined by a combination of all the above effects of
shattering and coagulation. Considering that shattering and coagulation in
turbulence are effective if dust-to-gas ratio is typically more than $\sim
1/10$ of the Galactic value, the regulation mechanism of grain size
distribution should be different between metal-poor and metal-rich
environments.",Astronomy

Imaged dust continuum emission at 870 micron reveals significant linear
polarization. The position angles (PAs) of the polarization vary enormously but
smoothly in a region of 2x10^4 AU. Based on the distribution of the PAs and the
associated structures, the polarized emission can be separated roughly into two
components. The component ""x"" is associated with a well defined dust ridge at

located at the periphery of the dust ridge and is probably from the original B
field associated with a pre-existing extended structure. The global B field
morphology in G5.89, as inferred from the PAs, is clearly disturbed by the
expansion of the HII region and the molecular outflows. Using the
Chandrasekhar-Fermi method, we estimate from the smoothness of the field
structures that the B field strength in the plane of sky can be no more than
2-3 mG. We then compare the energy densities in the radiation, the B field, and
the mechanical motions as deduced from the C^17O 3-2 line emission. We conclude

model-fitted optically thin jet components. Physical parameters of the compact

the radio core to the jet origin (r_core), can be calculated from these

during and after helium reionization, because the attenuation length of such
photons is relatively short (&lt;40 Mpc) and because the ionizing sources

examine these fluctuations, including, for the first time, those during the
reionization era itself. In agreement with detailed numerical simulations, our
analytic model for the post-reionization Universe predicts order-of-magnitude
fluctuations in the HeII ionization rate. Observations of the hardness ratio
between HeII/HI show even larger fluctuations, which may be due to more
complicated radiative transfer effects. During reionization, the fluctuations
are even stronger. In contrast to hydrogen reionization, our model predicts
that regions with strong HeII Lyman-alpha forest transmission should be
reasonably common even during the beginning stages of reionization, because of
strong illumination from bright quasars. Partly due to this, the mean ionizing
background does not evolve strongly during and after helium reionization; it is
roughly proportional to the filling fraction of HeIII regions. On the other

SMGs, SMMJ163555 and SMMJ163541, at z=1.034 and z=3.187 with unlensed submm
fluxes of 0.4mJy and 6.0mJy. Both SMGs are gravitationally lensed by the

observations at 3mm were obtained for the lines CO(2-1) for SMMJ163555 and
CO(3-2) for SMMJ163541. Additionally we obtained CO(4-3) for the candidate
z=4.048 SMMJ163556 with an unlensed submm flux of 2.7mJy. Results: CO(2-1) was

a precession time-scale. This physics is relevant for the Galactic center,
where massive stars are likely to form in eccentric disks around the SgrA*
black hole. We show that the observed bimodal eccentricity distribution of disk
stars in the Galactic center is in good agreement with the distribution
resulting from the eccentricity instability and demonstrate how the dynamical
evolution of such a disk results in several of its stars acquiring high (1-e &lt;

CMEs. The Aly-Sturrock conjecture states that the magnetic energy of a given

problematic for CME initiation because it leaves little or no magnetic energy
to drive the eruption, unless reconnection is present to allow some of the
field to escape without opening. Thus, it has been thought that reconnection
must be present to initiate CMEs. This theory has not been subject to rigorous
numerical testing because conventional MHD numerical models contain numerical
diffusion, which introduces uncontrolled numerical reconnection. We use a
quasi-Lagrangian simulation technique to run the first controlled experiments
of CME initiation in the complete lack of reconnection. We find that a flux
rope confined by an arcade, when twisted beyond a critical amount, can escape
to an open state, allowing some of the surrounding arcade to shrink and
releasing magnetic energy from the global field. This mechanism includes a true
ideal MHD instability. We conclude that reconnection is not a necessary trigger

rich envelopes. Near the systemic velocity, the hollow shell is fragmented into
several large blobs or arcs with missing portions correspond spatially to
locations of previously reported high--velocity outlows in the Egg nebula. This
provides direct evidence for the disruption of the slowly--expanding envelope

separate shells of HC$_3$N J=5--4 emission: (i) a faint outer shell that is
nearly spherical which has a radius of 8\arcsec; and (ii) a thick and
incomplete inner shell that resembles a one-arm spiral starting at or close to
the central star and extending out to a radius of about 5\arcsec. Our
observations therefore suggest that the mass loss from CIT 6 is strongly
modulated with time and highly anisotropic. Furthermore, a comparison between
the data and our excitation modelling results suggests an unusually high
abundance of HC$_3$N in its envelope. We discuss the possibility that the

shows a minimum at orbital phase ~ 0.1, close to the so-called superior
conjunction of the compact object, and a maximum at phase ~0.7, very close to
the inferior conjunction of the compact object. The X-ray spectral data up to
70 keV are described by a hard power-law with a phase-dependent photon index

a factor of 2.5, but is significantly less than that of the factor ~8 variation

Although periodic X-ray emission has been found from many galactic binary

be linked to very-high-energy electrons which are also responsible for the TeV

scattering by electrons on optical stellar photons, X-rays are produced via
synchrotron radiation. Yet, while the modulation of the TeV gamma-ray signal

spectral energy distributions (SEDs) at the lower redshift is larger and we
detect a significant AGN contribution in the sample. The distribution of the
equivalent widths is narrower than at z ~ 3, with only a few candidates with
rest-frame equivalent width above the predicted limit of 240 A. The star
formation rates derived from the Ly-alpha emission compared to that derived
from the UV emission are lower by on average a factor of ~ 1.8, indicating a
large absorption of dust. Conclusion: LAEs at redshift z = 2.25 may be more
evolved than LAEs at higher redshift. The red SEDs imply more massive, older
and/or more dusty galaxies at lower redshift than observed at higher redshifts.
The decrease in equivalent widths and star formation rates indicate more
quiescent galaxies, with in general less star formation than in higher redshift
galaxies. At z = 2.25, AGN appear to be more abundant and also to contribute
more to the LAE population. [Abridged]",Astronomy

depends on the frequency dependence of the absorption coefficient, in contrast
to the distribution obtained by methods based on entropy maximization. The
calculated mean absorption coefficients are not only correct in the limit of
optically thick and thin media, but even provide a reasonable interpolation in
the cross-over regime between these limits, notably without introducing any fit

simple example of non-grey matter with a two-band absorption spectrum. The
method is also briefly compared with the maximum entropy concept.",Astronomy
272,273.0,"There is a robust upper limit on the energy of synchrotron radiation in
high-energy astrophysics: $ \sim m_{\rm e} c^2 /\alpha$, where $\alpha = 1/137$

the fluid. This is the maximal energy of synchrotron photons which can be
emitted by an electron having an arbitrarily high initial energy after it turns
by angle $\sim \pi$ in the magnetic field. This upper limit can be naturally
reached if the converter mechanism contributes to the jet radiation and can be
imprinted in spectra of some blazars as a cutoff or a dip in the GeV range. We
use numerical simulations to probe the range of parameters of a radiating jet
where the ultimate synchrotron cutoff appears. We reproduce the variety of
spectra depending on the source luminosity and on the scale of the emission
site. We also compare our results with the EGRET blazar spectra in order to
illustrate that agreement is possible but still not statistically significant.
The predicted feature, if it exists, should be observed by {\it Fermi} in

tree approach previously developed to include the presence of star-forming
minihaloes, and an heuristic prescription for radiative feedback. The model

different XRBs follow different anti-correlations between $\Gamma$ and $\xi$
when $\xi$ is less than a critical value, while they follow the same positive
correlation when $\xi$ is larger than the critical value. This anti-correlation
and positive correlation are also found in LLAGNs and QSOs respectively, and
the anti-correlation and positive correlation of different XRBs roughly
converge to the same point ($\log \xi=-2.1, \Gamma=1.5$), which may correspond
to the accretion mode transition, since that the anti-correlation and positive
correlation are consistent with the prediction of ADAFs and standard
disk/corona system respectively. The traditional low/hard state are divided
into two parts by the cross point $\log \xi\sim-2.1$, i.e., faint-hard state in
the anti-correlation part and bright-hard state in the positive correlation
part. The accretion process in the bright-hard state may be still the standard
accretion disk as that in the high/soft state, which is consistent with that

properties of the ULXs to that of XRBs, we then constrain the BH masses for
seven luminous ULXs assuming that their X-ray spectral evolution is similar to
that of XRBs. We find that the BH masses of these seven ULXs are around
$10^{4}M_sun$, which are typical intermediate mass BHs (IMBHs). Our results are
roughly consistent with the BH masses constrained from the model fitting with a

(GRBs) in early 90's, the mathematical formulation of this process has stayed
at phenomenological level. One of the reasons for the slow development of
theoretical works in this domain has been the simple power-law behaviour of the
afterglows hours or days after the prompt gamma-ray emission. Nowadays with the
launch of the Swift satellite, gamma-ray bursts can be observed in
multi-wavelength from a few tens of seconds after trigger onward. These
observations have leaded to the discovery of features unexplainable by the
simple formulation of the shocks and emission processes used up to now. But
""devil is in details"" and some of these features may be explained with a more
detailed formulation of phenomena and without adhoc addition of new processes.
Such a formulation is the goal of this work. We present a consistent
formulation of the collision between two spherical relativistic shells. The
model can be applied to both internal and external shocks. Notably, we propose
two phenomenological models for the evolution of the emitting region during the
collision. One of these models is more suitable for the internal shocks and the
other for the external collisions. We calculate radiation flux, lags, and
hardness ratios. One of our aims has been a formulation enough complex to
include the essential processes, but enough simple such that the data can be
directly compared with the theory to extract the value and evolution of
physical quantities. To accomplish this goal, we also suggest a procedure for
extracting parameters of the model from data. In a following paper we

crucial for understanding galaxy evolution. Here, in the first paper of the

bright representatives of the dE/dS0 class ($M_B = -18.0 ... -16.0$ mag) look
very similar to intermediate-mass and giant lenticulars and ellipticals: (1)
their nuclear regions often harbour young metal-rich stellar populations always
associated with the drops in the velocity dispersion profiles; (2) metallicity

better than 1% for \sum m_\nu \lesssim 0.5 eV at z = 0. This error scales
approximately as (\sum m_\nu)^2, making the new linear neutrino method
extremely accurate for a total neutrino mass in the range 0.05 - 0.3 eV. At z =

f_m=0.13+/-0.01. We explore several fitting formalisms for parameterising the
merger fraction, and compare our results to other structural studies and pair
methods within the DEEP2, VVDS, and COSMOS fields. We also re-examine our
method for selecting mergers, and the inherent error budget and systematics
associated with identifying mergers using structure. For galaxies selected by
M_*&gt;10^{10} M_0, the merger fraction can be parameterised by f_m = f_0*(1+z)^m
with the power-law slope m=2.3+/-0.4. By using the best available z = 0 prior
the slope increases to m=3.8+/-0.2, showing how critical the measurement of

We furthermore show that the merger fraction derived through structure is
roughly a factor of 3-6 higher than pair fractions. Based on the latest
cosmological simulations of mergers we show that this ratio is predicted, and
that both methods are likely tracing the merger fraction and rate properly. We
calculate, utilising merger time scales from simulations, and previously

292,293.0,"In order to get astrometric parameters achieving the precision permitted by
the the forthcoming generation of astrometri cmeasurements, it will be
necessary to take into account effects that were neglected until the present

due to the variation of the distance and of the orientation of the orbital
plane during the observation time span. The latter effect is the light--travel
time (LTT), which is also related to the orientation of the orbital plane.
Taking these effects into account would allow to find the ascending nodes of
the orbits, and lead to orbital elements more accurate than when they are
ignored. It is derived from simulations that, at a distance of 5 pc, and
assuming velocities typical of Pop.I stars, the position of the right ascending
node could be derived for a few simulated unresolved binaries when the
astrometric measurements have errors around 1 microas. For the resolved brown
dwarf binary 2MASS J07464256 +2000321, it appears that ignoring the LP effect
would result in underestimating the masses of the components by 14 per cent of
the errors as soon as the astrometric errors are around 20 microas for each
measurement. However, a `degenerate LP solution', taking into account the
variation of the semi-major axis when the distance is varying, should provide
reliable masses when the measurement errors are larger than 1 or 2 microas. A

due to the shear and thermal instabilities. In both 2-D and 3-D simulations,
gas rotation increases the outflow thermal energy flux, but reduces the outflow
mass and kinetic energy fluxes. Rotation also leads to time variability and
fragmentation of the outflow in the radial and latitudinal directions. The
collimation of the outflow is reduced in the models with gas rotation. The time
variability in the mass and energy fluxes is reduced in the 3-D case because of
the outflow fragmentation in the azimuthal direction. The virial mass estimated

301,302.0,"The Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background (DSNB) provides an immediate
opportunity to study the emission of MeV thermal neutrinos from core-collapse
supernovae. The DSNB is a powerful probe of stellar and neutrino physics,
provided that the core-collapse rate is large enough and that its uncertainty
is small enough. To assess the important physics enabled by the DSNB, we start
with the cosmic star formation history of Hopkins &amp; Beacom (2006) and confirm
its normalization and evolution by cross-checks with the supernova rate,
extragalactic background light, and stellar mass density. We find a sufficient
core-collapse rate with small uncertainties that translate into a variation of
+/- 40% in the DSNB event spectrum. Considering thermal neutrino spectra with
effective temperatures between 4-6 MeV, the predicted DSNB is within a factor
4-2 below the upper limit obtained by Super-Kamiokande in 2003. Furthermore,
detection prospects would be dramatically improved with a gadolinium-enhanced
Super-Kamiokande: the backgrounds would be significantly reduced, the fluxes
and uncertainties converge at the lower threshold energy, and the predicted
event rate is 1.2-5.6 events /yr in the energy range 10-26 MeV. These results
demonstrate the imminent detection of the DSNB by Super-Kamiokande and its
exciting prospects for studying stellar and neutrino physics.",Astronomy
302,303.0,"We developed a new method to extract halo merger rates from the Millennium
Simulation. First, by removing superfluous mergers that are artifacts of the
FOF halo finder, we find a lower merger rate compared to previous work. The
reductions are more significant at lower redshifts, lower halo masses, and
minor mergers. Our approach agrees better with predictions from the EPS model.
Second, we find that the FOF halo finder overestimates the halo mass by up to
50% for halos that are about to merge, which leads to an additional ~20%
overestimate of the merger rate. Therefore, we define halo masses by including
only gravitationally bound particles. We provide new best-fitting parameters
for a global formula to account for these improvements. In addition, we extract
the merger rate per progenitor halo, as well as per descendant halo. The former
is the quantity that is related to observed galaxy merger fractions when they
are measured via pair counting. At low mass/redshift the merger rate increases
with mass and redshift. At high mass/redshift (for halos with masses a few
times the ""knee"" of the mass function) these trends break down, and the merger
rate per progenitor halo decreases with mass and increases only moderately with
redshift. Defining the merger rate per progenitor halo also allows us to
quantify the rate at which halos are being accreted onto larger halos. We
provide an analytic formula to convert given merger rates per descendant halo
into merger rates per progenitor halo. Finally, we perform a comparison between
observed merger fractions and the fraction of halos that have undergone a major
merger during the recent dynamical friction time, and find a fair agreement,
within the large uncertainties of the observations. Our new halo merger trees
are available at http://www.mpe.mpg.de/ir/MillenniumMergerTrees/.",Astronomy
303,304.0,"Our heuristic understanding of the abundance of dark matter halos centers
around the concept of a density threshold, or ""barrier"", for gravitational
collapse. If one adopts the ansatz that regions of the linearly evolved density
field smoothed on mass scale M with an overdensity that exceeds the barrier
will undergo gravitational collapse into halos of mass M, the corresponding
abundance of such halos can be estimated simply as a fraction of the mass
density satisfying the collapse criterion divided by the mass M. The key
ingredient of this ansatz is therefore the functional form of the collapse
barrier as a function of mass M or, equivalently, of the variance sigma^2(M).
Several such barriers based on the spherical, Zel'dovich, and ellipsoidal
collapse models have been extensively discussed. Using large scale cosmological
simulations, we show that the relation between the linear overdensity and the
mass variance for regions that collapse to form halos by the present epoch
resembles expectations from dynamical models of ellipsoidal collapse. However,
we also show that using such a collapse barrier with the excursion set ansatz
predicts a halo mass function inconsistent with that measured directly in
cosmological simulations. This inconsistency demonstrates a failure of the
excursion set ansatz as a physical model for halo collapse. We discuss
implications of our results for understanding the collapse epoch for halos as a
function of mass, and avenues for improving consistency between analytical
models for the collapse epoch and the results of cosmological simulations.",Astronomy

near-infrared Wide Field Camera (WFCAM) on the United Kingdom Infrared

analysis of spatial systematics in the photometric calibration, both inter- and
intra-detector and show that these are present at up to the 5 per cent level in
WFCAM. Although the causes of these systematics are not yet fully understood, a
method for their removal is developed and tested. Following application of the
correction procedure the photometric calibration of WFCAM is found to be
accurate to approximately 1.5 per cent for the JHK bands and 2 per cent for the
ZY bands, meeting the survey requirements. We investigate the transformations
between the 2MASS and WFCAM systems and find that the Z and Y calibration is
sensitive to the effects of interstellar reddening for large values of E(B-V)',
but that the JHK filters remain largely unaffected. We measure a small
correction to the WFCAM Y-band photometry required to place WFCAM on a Vega

305,306.0,"We have tested the two main theoretical models of bubbles around massive star
clusters, Castor et al. and Chevalier &amp; Clegg, against observations of the well
studied Carina Nebula. The Castor et al. theory over-predicts the X-ray
luminosity in the Carina bubble by a factor of 60 and expands too rapidly, by a
factor of 4; if the correct radius and age are used, the predicted X-ray
luminosity is even larger. In contrast, the Chevalier &amp; Clegg model
under-predicts the X-ray luminosity by a factor of 10. We modify the Castor et
al. theory to take into account lower stellar wind mass loss rates, radiation
pressure, gravity, and escape of or energy loss from the hot shocked gas. We
argue that energy is advected rather than radiated from the bubble. We
undertake a parameter study for reduced stellar mass loss rates and for various
leakage rates and are able to find viable models. The X-ray surface brightness
in Carina is highest close to the bubble wall, which is consistent with
conductive evaporation from cold clouds. The picture that emerges is one in
which the hot gas pressure is far below that found by dividing the
time-integrated wind luminosity by the bubble volume; rather, the pressure in
the hot gas is set by pressure equilibrium with the photoionized gas at T=10^4

6x10^4 galaxies spanning the mass range from 10^5 to 10^12 Msun. We measure the
stellar mass dependence of the two point correlation using angular measurements
to largely bypass the errors, approximately 0.02 in the median, of the
photometric redshifts. Inverting the power-law fits with Limber's equation we
find that the auto-correlation length increases from a very low 0.4hMpc at
10^5.5 Msun to the conventional 4.5hMpc at 10^10.5 Msun. The power law fit to
the correlation function has a slope which increases from gamma approximately
1.6 at high mass to gamma approximately 2.3 at low mass. The spatial
cross-correlation of dwarf galaxies with more massive galaxies shows fairly
similar trends, with a steeper radial dependence at low mass than predicted in
numerical simulations of sub-halos within galaxy halos. To examine the issue of
missing satellites we combine the cross-correlation measurements with our
estimates of the low mass galaxy number density. We find on the average there
are 60+/-20 dwarfs in sub-halos with M(total) &gt; 10^7 Msun for a typical Local
Group M(total)/M(stars)=30, corresponding to M/L_V approximately 100 for a
galaxy with no recent star formation. The number of dwarfs per galaxy is about
a factor of two larger than currently found for the Milky Way. Nevertheless,
the average dwarf counts are about a factor of 30 below LCDM simulation
results. The divergence from LCDM predictions is one of slope of the relation,
approximately dN/dlnM approximately -0.5 rather than the predicted -0.9, not
sudden onset at some characteristic scale. The dwarf galaxy star formation

307,308.0,"Recently, it was argued that the log(z)-m_{v} plot of 106,000 AGN galaxies
could be interpreted as an evolutionary path followed by local AGN galaxies as
they age. It was suggested that these objects are born as quasars with a high
intrinsic redshift component that decreases with time. When the intrinsic
component is large it causes them to be pushed above the standard candle line
for brightest radio galaxies on a log(z)-m_{v} plot. In the jets of radio loud
AGN galaxies, Beta_(app) is the apparent transverse velocity of the ejected
material relative to the speed of light. In the cosmological redshift (CR)
model the Beta_(app) vs z distribution has a peculiar shape, and there have
been several attempts to explain it. In agreement with the model proposed to
explain the log(z)-m_{v} plot, it is shown here that the peculiar shape of the
Beta_(app)-z distribution in the CR model is exactly what is expected if the
sources are local but their large intrinsic redshifts are assumed to be
cosmological in the calculation of Beta_(app). This result not only supports
our previous interpretation of the log(z)-m_{v} plot, it further implies that
if a large component of the redshift is intrinsic a similar effect should be
visible when other parameters are plotted vs z. Examining this it is also found
that the results are consistent with the local model.",Astronomy
308,309.0,"We use three-dimensional direct numerical simulations of the helically forced
magnetohydrodynamic equations in spherical shell segments in order to study the
effects of changes in the geometrical shape and size of the domain on the

along with kinetic helicity in spherical domains via helical forcing using
Chandrasekhar-Kendall functions. We take perfect conductor boundary conditions
for the magnetic field to ensure that no magnetic helicity escapes the domain
boundaries. We find dynamo action giving rise to magnetic fields at scales
larger than the characteristic scale of the forcing. The magnetic energy
exceeds the kinetic energy over dissipative time scales, similar to that seen
earlier in Cartesian simulations in periodic boxes. As we increase the size of
the domain in the azimuthal direction we find that the nonlinearly saturated
magnetic field organizes itself in long-lived cellular structures with aspect
ratios close to unity. These structures tile the domain along the azimuthal
direction, thus resulting in very small longitudinally averaged magnetic fields
for large domain sizes. The scales of these structures are determined by the
smallest scales of the domain, which in our simulations is usually the radial
scale. We also find that increasing the meridional extent of the domains
produces little qualitative change, except a marginal increase in the
large-scale field. We obtain qualitatively similar results in Cartesian domains

with the prediction of full network stellar models of low mass AGB stars. These
models also reproduce the $s$-process elements distribution in the sampled

convention) and of the 3-coordinates inside them. As a particular case we get
the extension of the inertial rest-frame instant form of dynamics to the
non-inertial rest-frame one. We show that every isolated system can be
described as an external decoupled non-covariant canonical center of mass

early [WO] for PB6 and NGC2867 and [WC 5-6] in the case of PB8. Our aim is to
study the behavior of the abundance discrepancy problem (ADF) in this type of
PNe. We measured a large number of optical recombination (ORL) and
collisionally excited lines (CEL), from different ionization stages (many more

from many different diagnostic procedures. We determined ionic abundances from
the available collisionally excited lines and recombination lines. Based on

the chemical composition of the wind of the central star, indicating that there

analytic approximation of the mode which allows us to write down a closed
expression for the mutual friction damping timescale. The analytic result is in
good agreement with previous numerical results obtained using an energy
integral argument. We extend previous work by considering the full range of
permissible values for the vortex drag, e.g. the friction between each
individual vortex and the electron fluid. This leads to the first ever results
for the f-mode in the strong drag regime. Our estimates provide useful insight
into the dependence on, and relevance of, various equation of state parameters.
In the case of the (axial) r-modes, we confirm the existence of two classes of

companion studies of the mutual friction damping of the r-modes at second order

reach similar field strengths (approximately 2-3 10^{13} G) at late times.
Irrespectively of the initial magnetic field strength, after $10^6$ years the
temperature becomes so low that the magnetic diffusion timescale becomes longer
than the typical ages of radio--pulsars, thus resulting in apparently no
dissipation of the field in old NS. We also confirm the strong correlation
between the magnetic field and the surface temperature of relatively young NSs
discussed in preliminary works. The effective temperature of models with strong
internal toroidal components are systematically higher than those of models
with purely poloidal fields, due to the additional energy reservoir stored in
the toroidal field that is gradually released as the field dissipates.",Astronomy
327,328.0,"In the framework of the braneworld models, rotating black holes can be
described by the Kerr metric with a tidal charge representing the influence of
the non-local gravitational (tidal) effects of the bulk space Weyl tensor onto
the black hole spacetime. We study the influence of the tidal charge onto
profiled spectral lines generated by radiating tori orbiting in vicinity of a
rotating black hole. We show that with lowering the negative tidal charge of
the black hole, the profiled line becomes to be flatter and wider keeping their
standard character with flux stronger at the blue edge of the profiled line.
The extension of the line grows with radius falling and inclination angle
growing. With growing inclination angle a small hump appears in the profiled
lines due to the strong lensing effect of photons coming from regions behind
the black hole. For positive tidal charge ($b&gt;0$) and high inclination angles
two small humps appear in the profiled lines close to the red and blue edge of
the lines due to the strong lensing effect. We can conclude that for all values
of $b$, the strongest effect on the profiled lines shape (extension) is caused
by the changes of the inclination angle.",Astronomy

Thomas-Fermi-Dirac model in presence of strong quantizing magnetic field a
formalism is developed to investigate this specific problem. The equation of
state of such low density crustal matter is obtained by replacing the

South 1.4 and 5 GHz VLA survey. The radio population is studied by using a
wealth of multi-wavelength information in the radio, optical, and X-ray bands.
The availability of redshifts for ~ 80% of the sources in our complete sample
allows us to derive reliable luminosity estimates for the majority of the
objects. X-ray data, including upper limits, for all our sources turn out to be
a key factor in establishing the nature of faint radio sources. Due to the
faint optical levels probed by this study, we have uncovered a population of
distant Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) systematically missing from many previous
studies of sub-millijansky radio source identifications. We find that, while
the well-known flattening of the radio number counts below 1 mJy is mostly due
to star forming galaxies, these sources and AGN make up an approximately equal
fraction of the sub-millijansky sky, contrary to some previous results. The AGN
include radio galaxies, mostly of the low-power, Fanaroff-Riley I type, and a
significant radio-quiet component, which amounts to approximately one fifth of
the total sample. The ratio of radio to optical luminosity depends more on
radio luminosity, rather than being due to optical absorption.",Astronomy

the angular CCF for direct comparison with observations. Finally, we calculate
the auto-correlation functions of LBGs and DLAs, and their bias against the
dark matter distribution. For these different approaches, we consistently find
that there is good agreement between our simulations and observational

that the spatial distribution of LBGs and DLAs can be well described within the

alone are well matched to those when additional mid-infrared spectroscopic and
longer wavelength photometric data is used for galaxies having z &lt; 1.4 and
24um-derived IR luminosities typically &gt; 3x10^12 L_sun. However, for galaxies

luminosities &gt; 3x10^12 L_sun, IR luminosities are overestimated by an average
factor of ~5 when SED fitting with 24um photometry alone. This result arises
partly due to the fact that high redshift galaxies exhibit PAH EQWs that are

estimates for the IR luminosities of these sources, we investigate whether
their IR emission is found to be in excess relative to that expected based on
extinction corrected UV SFRs, possibly suggesting the presence of an obscured

on the interstellar medium (ISM) of 10 Virgo cluster spiral galaxies using {\it
Spitzer} far-infrared (FIR) and VLA radio continuum imaging. Relying on the
FIR-radio correlation within normal galaxies, we use our infrared data to
create model radio maps which we compare to the observed radio images. For 6 of
our sample galaxies we find regions along their outer edges that are highly
deficient in the radio compared with our models. We believe these observations
are the signatures of ICM ram pressure. For NGC 4522 we find the radio deficit
region to lie just exterior to a region of high radio polarization and flat
radio spectral index, although the total 20 cm radio continuum in this region
does not appear strongly enhanced. These characteristics seem consistent for
other galaxies with radio polarization data in the literature. The strength of
the radio deficit is inversely correlated with the time since peak pressure as
inferred from stellar population studies and gas stripping simulations,
suggesting the strength of the radio deficit is good indicator of the strength
of the current ram pressure. We also find that galaxies having {\it local}
radio {\it deficits} appear to have {\it enhanced global} radio fluxes. Our
preferred physical picture is that the observed radio deficit regions arise
from the ICM wind sweeping away cosmic-ray (CR) electrons and the associated
magnetic field, thereby creating synchrotron tails as observed for some of our

in major mergers: a large fraction of the galaxy must be converted to new bulge
mass in a dynamical time or less. Low-luminosity AGN, in contrast, require
little bulge growth and small gas supplies, and could be triggered in more
common non-merger events. This predicts a transition to merger-induced fueling
around the traditional quasar-Seyfert luminosity divide (growth of BH masses
above/below 10^7 M_sun). We compile observations to test several predictions of
such a division, including: (1) A transition to bulge-dominated hosts. (2) A
transition between 'pseudobulges' and 'classical' bulges hosting the remnant
BHs: pseudobulges are formed in secular processes and minor mergers, whereas
classical bulges are relics of major mergers. (3) An increase in the amplitude
of small-scale clustering where mergers are more efficient. (4) Different
redshift evolution, with gas-rich merger rates rising to redshifts z&gt;2 while

peculiar chemical patterns with strong abundance variations in light elements

to rotational induced mixing. If the rotation of the stars is fast enough this
matter is ejected at low velocity through a mechanical wind at the equator. It
then pollutes the ISM from which a second generation of chemically anomalous
stars can be formed. The proportion of anomalous to normal star observed today
depends on at least two quantities : (1) the number of polluter stars; (2) the
dynamical history of the cluster which may lose during its lifetime first and
second generation stars in different proportions. Here we estimate these
proportions based on dynamical models for globular clusters. When internal
dynamical evolution and dissolution due to tidal forces are accounted for,
starting from an initial fraction of anomalous stars of 10% produces a present
day fraction of about 25%, still too small with respect to the observed 70-85%.

Interstellar lines of HI, NI, OI, SiII, PII, ArI, and FeII are detected. Column
densities are derived directly from the observed line profiles except for HI,
whose lines are contaminated by stellar absorption. We used the TLUSTY models
to remove the stellar continuum and isolate the interstellar component. The
best fit indicates that the dominant stellar population is B0. The fit of the
interstellar HI line gives a column density of 10^{20.3\pm0.4} cm-2. Chemical
abundances were then computed from the column densities using the dominant
ionization stage in the neutral gas. Our abundances are compared to those
measured from emission-line spectra in the optical. Our results suggest that
the neutral gas of Pox 36 is metal-deficient by a factor ~7 as compared to the
ionized gas, and they agree with a metallicity of ~1/35 Z$_\odot$. Conclusions:
The abundance discontinuity between the neutral and ionized phases implies that
most of the metals released by consecutive star-formation episodes mixes with
the HI gas. The volume extent of the enrichment is so large that the
metallicity of the neutral gas increases only slightly. The star-forming
regions could be enriched only by a small fraction (~1%), but it would greatly

358,359.0,"The proto-planetary Red Rectangle nebula is powered by HD 44179, a
spectroscopic binary (P = 318 d), in which a luminous post-AGB component is the
primary source of both luminosity and current mass loss. Here, we present the
results of a seven-year, eight-orbit spectroscopic monitoring program of HD
44179, designed to uncover new information about the source of the
Lyman/far-ultraviolet continuum in the system as well as the driving mechanism
for the bipolar outflow producing the current nebula. Our observations of the
H-alpha line profile around the orbital phase of superior conjunction reveal
the secondary component to be the origin of the fast (max. v~560$ km s$^{-1}$)
bipolar outflow in the Red Rectangle. The variation of total H-alpha flux from
the central H II region with orbital phase also identifies the secondary or its
surroundings as the source of the far-ultraviolet ionizing radiation in the
system. The estimated mass of the secondary (~0.94 M$\sun$) and the speed of
the outflow suggest that this component is a main sequence star and not a white
dwarf, as previously suggested. We identify the source of the
Lyman/far-ultraviolet continuum in the system as the hot, inner region
(T$_{max} \ge 17,000$ K) of an accretion disk surrounding the secondary, fed by
Roche lobe overflow from the post-AGB primary at a rate of about $2 -
5\times10^{-5}$ M$\sun$ yr$^{-1}$. The total luminosity of the accretion disk
around the secondary is estimated to be at least 300 L$\sun$, about 5% of the
luminosity of the entire system. (abridged)",Astronomy

which determines the location of the magnetospheric radius of the star for a
given stellar magnetic field. We introduce a classification of accreting
neutron stars as a function of the accretion rate and show the corresponding
stages obtained from our global 3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations and
from our axisymmetric MHD simulations. We discuss the expected variability
features in each stage of accretion, both periodic and quasi-periodic (QPOs).

362,363.0,"(Abridged) We use 8 micron Spitzer GLIMPSE images to make extinction maps of
10 IRDCs, selected to be relatively nearby and massive. The extinction mapping
technique requires modeling the IR background intensity behind the cloud, which
is achieved by correcting for foreground emission and then interpolating from
the surrounding regions. The correction for foreground emission can be quite
large, thus restricting the utility of this technique to relatively nearby
clouds. We investigate three methods for the interpolation, finding systematic
differences at about the 10% level, which, for fiducial dust models,
corresponds to a mass surface density Sigma = 0.013 g cm^-2, above which we
conclude this extinction mapping technique attains validity. We examine the
probability distribution function of Sigma in IRDCs. From a qualitative
comparison with numerical simulations of astrophysical turbulence, many clouds
appear to have relatively narrow distributions suggesting relatively low (&lt;5)
Mach numbers and/or dynamically strong magnetic fields. Given cloud kinematic
distances, we derive cloud masses. Rathborne, Jackson &amp; Simon identified cores
within the clouds and measured their masses via mm dust emission. For 43 cores,
we compare these mass estimates with those derived from our extinction mapping,
finding good agreement: typically factors of &lt;~2 difference for individual
cores and an average systematic offset of &lt;~10% for the adopted fiducial
assumptions of each method. We find tentative evidence for a systematic

366,367.0,"This is the first paper of a series aimed to understand the formation and
evolution of bars in early-type spirals and their influence in the evolution of
the galaxy. Optical long-slit spectra along the major axis of the bar of a
sample of 20 galaxies are analyzed. Line-strength indices in the bar region are
measured to derive stellar mean-age and metallicity distributions along the
bars using stellar population models. We find three different types of bars
according to their metallicity and age distribution along the radius: 1) Bars
with negative metallicity gradients. They show mean young/intermediate
population (&lt; 2 Gyr), and have amongst the lowest stellar maximum central
velocity dispersion of the sample. 2) Bars with null metallicity gradients.
These galaxies tend to have negative age gradients. 3) Bars with positive
metallicity gradients. These galaxies are predominantly those with higher
velocity dispersion and older mean population. We found no significant
correlation between the age and metallicity distribution, and bar/galaxy
parameters such as the AGN presence, size or the bar strength. From the
kinematics, we find that all the galaxies show a disk-like central component.
The results from the metallicity and age gradients indicate that most galaxies
with high central stellar velocity dispersion host bars that could have been
formed more than 3 Gyrs ago, while galaxies with lower central velocity
dispersions show a wider distribution in their population and age gradients. A
few bars show characteristics compatible with having been formed less than &lt;2
Gy ago. These results place strong constrains to models of bar formation and

these redshifts, being 50% complete at column densities log(N_{CIV})=13.4. We
find no C IV systems in any of the four sightlines. Taking into account our
completeness, this translates into a decline in the number density of C IV
absorbers in the range 13.0 &lt; log(N_{CIV}) &lt; 15.0 of at least a factor 4.4 (95%
confidence) from z~2-4.5, where the number density is relatively constant. We
use our lack of detections to set limits on the slope and normalization of the
column density distribution at z=5.3-6.0. The rapid evolution of C IV at these
redshifts suggests that the decrease in the number density may largely be due
to ionization effects, in which case many of the metals in the z~4.5 IGM could
already be in place at z~5.3, but in a lower ionization state. The lack of weak
systems in our data, combined with the presence of strong C IV absorbers along

quintessence field we show that the coupling to the inflaton causes the
quintessence field to be attracted towards the minimum of the effective
potential. If the coupling is large enough, the field is heavy and is located
at the minimum. We show how this affects the expansion rate and the slow-roll

scenarios include an annihilation of two WIMPs into two gamma-rays. If the
WIMPs are assumed to be non-relativistic, the resulting photons will both have
an energy equal to the mass of the WIMP and manifest themselves as a
monochromatic spectral line in the energy spectrum. This type of signal would

gravitational constant is a constant and there is no direct exchange of energy
between DE and dark matter (DM), knowledge of the expansion history suffices to
reconstruct the growth factor of linearized density perturbations in the
non-relativistic matter component on scales much smaller than the Hubble
distance. In this paper we develop a non-parametric method for extracting
information about the perturbative growth factor from data pertaining to the
luminosity or angular size distances. A comparison of the reconstructed density
contrast with observations of large scale structure and gravitational lensing
can help distinguish DE models such as the cosmological constant and
quintessence from models based on modified gravity theories as well as models
in which DE and DM are either unified, or interact directly. We show that for
current SNe data, the linear growth factor at z = 0.3 can be constrained to 5%,

the JDEM mission, we may be able to constrain the growth factor to 2-3% and the
growth rate to 3-4% at z = 0.3 with this unbiased, model-independent
reconstruction method. For future BAO data which would deliver measurements of
both the angular diameter distance and Hubble parameter, it should be possible
to constrain the growth factor at z = 2.5 to 9%. These constraints grow tighter
with the errors on the datasets. With a large quantity of data expected in the
next few years, this method can emerge as a competitive tool for distinguishing
between different models of dark energy.",Astronomy

mid- and far-IR wavelengths, identifying the first debris disk systems, but was
unable to detect a statistically significant sample of warm debris disks due to
its limited sensitivity at 12 microns. Using Tycho-2 Spectral Catalog stars
previously shown to exhibit 8 micron mid-infrared circumstellar excesses
confirmed at 24 microns in the Spitzer GLIMPSE survey, we investigate the
frequency of mid-IR excesses among intermediate-mass (2--4 solar mass) stars in

We find that 0.3+-0.3% of intermediate-mass stars exhibit a signature of a
possible terrestrial-temperature debris disks at wavelengths of 8 microns and
greater. We also find that 1.2+-0.6% of intermediate-mass stars exhibit
evidence for circumstellar disks undergoing inner disk clearing, i.e.,
candidate transition disk systems. Using stellar lifetimes and the frequency of

pre-main-sequence disks around intermediate-mass stars dissipate in 5+-2 Myr,

a heavy boson, such as neutrinos interacting via the $Z^0$, the condensate has
the same quantum numbers as the vierbein of General Relativity. Because there
exists an enhanced global symmetry $SO(3,1)_{space}\times SO(3,1)_{spin}$ among
the fermion's self-interactions broken only by its kinetic term, the long

rotation as a function of two dimensionless parameters, W(=Vrot/Vorb) and 'wind
magnetic confinement', $\eta_\ast$ defined below. We compare and contrast the
2-D, time variable angular momentum loss of this dipole model of a hot-star
wind with the classical 1-D steady-state analysis by Weber and Davis (WD), who
used an idealized monopole field to model the angular momentum loss in the
solar wind. Despite the differences, we find that the total angular momentum
loss averaged over both solid angle and time follows closely the general WD
scaling $\dot {J} \sim \dot {M} \Omega R_A^2$. The key distinction is that for
a dipole field Alfv\`en radius $R_A$ is significantly smaller than for the

8-m Gemini South Telescope. The binary, containing an accretion-powered
millisecond pulsar, appears to have a large periodic modulation in its
quiescent optical emission. In order to clarify the origin of this modulation,
we obtained three time-resolved $r'$-band light curves (LCs) of the source in
five days. The LCs can be described by a sinusoid, and the long time-span
between them allows us to determine optical period P=7251.9 s and phase 0.671
at MJD 54599.0 (TDB; phase 0.0 corresponds to the ascending node of the pulsar
orbit), with uncertainties of 2.8 s and 0.008 (90 % confidence), respectively.
This periodicity is highly consistent with the X-ray orbital ephemeris. By
considering this consistency and the sinusoidal shape of the LCs, we rule out
the possibility of the modulation arising from the accretion disk. Our study
supports the previous suggestion that the X-ray pulsar becomes rotationally
powered in quiescence, with its energy output irradiating the companion star,
causing the optical modulation. While it has also been suggested that the
accretion disk would be evaporated by the pulsar, we argue that the disk exists
and gives rise to the persistent optical emission. The existence of the disk
can be verified by long-term, multi-wavelength optical monitoring of the source

varied from a low state to respectively intermediate states. These transitions
are interpreted as eclipse ingress and egresses of a compact object in a high
mass X-ray binary system. The phase of mid eclipse is given by HJD
2453997.476+-0.006, the eclipse half angle is 30.6+-1.2 degree. Adding
XMM-Newton observations of [PMH2004] 47 in 2001 we determine the binary period
to be 1.732479+-0.000027 d. This period is also consistent with ROSAT HRI
observations of the source in 1994. No short term periodicity compatible with a
rotation period of the compact object is detected. There are indications for a
long term variability similar to that detected for Her X-1. During the high
state the spectrum of the source is hard (power law spectrum with photon index
~0.85) with an unabsorbed luminosity of 2E37 erg/cm2/s (0.2-4.5 keV). We

387,388.0,"We consider the polarization arising from scattering in an envelope
illuminated by a central anisotropic source. Spherical harmonics are used to
describe both the light source anisotropy and the envelope density distribution
functions of the scattering particles. This framework demonstrates how the net
resultant polarization arises from a superposition of three basic ""shape""
functions: the distribution of source illumination, the distribution of
envelope scatterers, and the phase function for dipole scattering. Specific
expressions for the Stokes parameters and scattered flux are derived for the
case of an ellipsoidal light source inside an ellipsoidal envelope, with
principal axes that are generally not aligned. Two illustrative examples are
considered: (a) axisymmetric mass loss from a rapidly rotating star, such as
may apply to some Luminous Blue Variables, and (b) a Roche-lobe filling star in
a binary system with a circumstellar envelope. As a general conclusion, the
combination of source anisotropy with distorted scattering envelopes leads to
more complex polarimetric behavior such that the source characteristics should
be carefully considered when interpreting polarimetric data.",Astronomy

selfinteraction mediated by vector mesons are studied within the mean-field

interaction strengths which results in an universal mass-radius relation. The
radius remains nearly constant for a wide range of compact star masses. The
maximum stable mass and radius of boson stars are determined by the interaction
strength and scale with the Landau mass and radius. Both, the maximum mass and
the corresponding radius increase linearly with the interaction strength so

from star formation to the endpoints. The main effects are briefly reviewed. We
also show that O-type stars have large convective envelopes, where convective
dynamo could work. There, fields in magnetostatic balance have intensities of
the order of 100 G. A few OB stars with strong polar fields (Henrichs et al.
2003a) show large N-enhancements indicating a strong internal mixing. We
suggest that the meridional circulation enhanced by an internal rotation law
close to uniform in these magnetic stars is responsible for the observed
mixing. Thus, it is not the magnetic field itself which makes the mixing, but
the strong thermal instability associated to solid body rotation. A critical
question for evolution is whether a dynamo is at work in radiative zones of
rotating stars. The Tayler-Spruit (TS) dynamo is the best candidate. We derive
some basic relations for dynamos in radiative layers. Evolutionary models with
TS dynamo show important effects: internal rotation coupling and enhanced
mixing, all model outputs being affected.",Astronomy

correctly reproduced if the conservative 1PN and 2PN terms are included. The
orbital eccentricities of the massive binaries in our simulations are often
found to remain large until shortly before coalescence. This directly affects
not only their orbital evolution rates, but has important consequences as well
for the gravitational waveforms emitted during the relativistic inspiral. We

subsequent star formation in nearby protogalaxies. Here we study the radiative
feedback from the first, short-lived stars using hydrodynamical simulations
with transient UV backgrounds (UVBs) and persistent Lyman-Werner backgrounds
(LWBs) of varying intensity. We extend our prior work in Mesinger et al.
(2006), by studying a more typical region whose proto-galaxies form at lower
redshifts, z~13-20, in the epoch likely preceding the bulk of reionization. We
confirm our previous results that feedback in the relic HII regions resulting
from such transient radiation, is itself transient. Feedback effects dwindle
away after ~30% of the Hubble time, and the same critical specific intensity of
J_UV~0.1 x 10^{-21} ergs/s/cm^2/Hz/sr separates positive and negative feedback
regimes. Additionally, we discover a second episode of eventual positive
feedback in halos which have not yet collapsed when their progenitor regions
were exposed to the transient UVB. This eventual positive feedback appears in
all runs, regardless of the strength of the UVB. However, this feedback regime
is very sensitive to the presence of Lyman-Werner radiation, and notable
effects disappear under fairly modest background intensities of J_LW&gt;10^{-3} x
10^{-21} ergs/s/cm^2/Hz/sr. We conclude that UV radiative feedback in relic HII
regions, although a complicated process, seems unlikely to have a major impact
on the progress of cosmological reionization, provided that present estimates
of the lifetime and luminosity of a PopIII star are accurate. More likely is
that the build-up of the LWB ultimately governs the feedback strength until a
persistent UV background can be established. [abridged]",Astronomy

emission from E galaxies is a combination of circumstellar or interstellar
emission from local mass-losing red giant stars, dust buoyantly transported
from the galactic cores into distant hot interstellar gas and dust accreted
from the environment. The source of mid and far-IR emission in S0 galaxies is
quite different and is consistent with low levels of star formation, 0.02 - 0.2
Msol/yr, in cold, dusty gaseous disks. The infrared 24micron-70micron color is
systematically lower for (mostly S0) galaxies with known molecular disks. Our
observations support the conjecture that cold dusty gas in some S0 galaxies is
created by stellar mass loss at approximately the same rate that it is consumed
by star formation, so the mass depletion of these disks by star formation will
be slow. Unlike E galaxies, the infrared luminosities of S0 galaxies correlate
with both the mass of molecular gas and the stellar Hbeta spectral index, and
all are related to the recent star formation rate. However, star formation
rates estimated from the Hbeta emission line luminosities L_{Hbeta} in SAURON
S0 galaxies are generally much smaller. Since L_{Hbeta} does not correlate with
24 microns emission from dust heated by young stars, optical emission lines

maximum of 9.9 +/- 2.3 mas (~ 6 Rstar). This flux contribution is in good
agreement with the photometric IR excess of 10-20% measured by fitting the
spectral energy distribution. Due to our limited azimuth coverage, we can only
establish an upper limit of 5-10% for the equatorial envelope. We compare the
observed properties of the envelope with an existing model of this star
computed with the SIMECA code.
  Conclusions: The observed extended emission in the thermal IR along the polar
direction of Achernar is well reproduced by the existing SIMECA model. Already
detected at 2.2mic, this polar envelope is most probably an observational
signature of the fast wind ejected by the hot polar caps of the star.",Astronomy
418,419.0,"We present the first results from two-dimensional simulations of
radiatively-efficient accretion of metal-free gas onto intermediate-mass black
holes. We fix the shape of the spectral energy distribution of the radiation
produced near the event horizon and study the structure of the irradiated
low-angular-momentum accretion flow over three orders of magnitude in radius
from the black hole, 10^{14}-10^{17} cm for a 100 M_sun black hole. The
luminosity of the central source is made to be proportional to the rate at
which gas accretes across the inner boundary, which we set just inside the
sonic radius. We find that photoionization heating and radiation pressure
modify the structure of the flow. When the ambient gas density is 10^7 cm^{-3},
accretion is intermittent and on average reduced to 32% of the
Eddington-limited rate, two orders of magnitude below the ""Bondi"" rate
evaluated ignoring radiation, in agreement with simplified theoretical models.
Even if the vicinity of the black hole is supplied with high density gas,
accretion is rendered inefficient through heating and radiation pressure.",Astronomy
419,420.0,"Upper limits on the shock speeds in supernova remnants can be combined with
post-shock temperatures to obtain upper limits on the ratio of cosmic ray to
gas pressure (P_CR / P_G) behind the shocks. We constrain shock speeds from
proper motions and distance estimates, and we derive temperatures from X-ray
spectra. The shock waves are observed as faint H-alpha filaments stretching
around the Cygnus Loop supernova remnant in two epochs of the Palomar
Observatory Sky Survey (POSS) separated by 39.1 years. We measured proper
motions of 18 non-radiative filaments and derived shock velocity limits based
on a limit to the Cygnus Loop distance of 576 +/- 61 pc given by Blair et al.
for a background star. The PSPC instrument on-board ROSAT observed the X-ray
emission of the post-shock gas along the perimeter of the Cygnus Loop, and we
measure post-shock electron temperature from spectral fits. Proper motions
range from 2.7 arcseconds to 5.4 arcseconds over the POSS epochs and post-shock
temperatures range from kT ~ 100-200 eV. Our analysis suggests a cosmic ray to
post-shock gas pressure consistent with zero, and in some positions P_CR is
formally smaller than zero. We conclude that the distance to the Cygnus Loop is
close to the upper limit given by the distance to the background star and that
either the electron temperatures are lower than those measured from ROSAT PSPC

to thermal conduction, is required.",Astronomy

parameters and also introduce modified cosmological distances, analyzing in
particular the case of the luminosity distance.
  Our kinematical conformal cosmology is then able to explain the anomalous
acceleration of the Pioneer spacecraft, as due to a local region of
gravitational blueshift. From the reported values of the Pioneer anomaly we
also compute the current value of our first fundamental parameter, gamma_{0} =

this quantity.
  Our second fundamental parameter, delta_{0} = 3.83 x 10^{-5}, interpreted as
the current value of a cosmological time variable, is derived from a detailed
fitting of type Ia Supernovae ""gold-silver"" data, producing Hubble plots of the
same quality of those obtained by standard cosmology, but without requiring any
dark matter or dark energy contribution.
  If further experiments will confirm the presence of an anomalous frequency

formation of clumps in a marginally-gravitationally unstable protoplanetary
disk, which must lose thermal energy through a combination of convection and

protoplanets. While there is good observational support for forming at least
some giant planets by disk instability, the mechanism has become theoretically
contentious, with different three dimensional radiative hydrodynamics codes
often yielding different results. Rigorous code testing is required to make
further progress. Here we present two new analytical solutions for radiative
transfer in spherical coordinates, suitable for testing the code employed in
all of the Boss disk instability calculations. The testing shows that the Boss
code radiative transfer routines do an excellent job of relaxing to and
maintaining the analytical results for the radial temperature and radiative
flux profiles for a spherical cloud with high or moderate optical depths,
including the transition from optically thick to optically thin regions. These
radial test results are independent of whether the Eddington approximation,
diffusion approximation, or flux-limited diffusion approximation routines are
employed. The Boss code does an equally excellent job of relaxing to and
maintaining the analytical results for the vertical (theta) temperature and
radiative flux profiles for a disk with a height proportional to the radial
distance. These tests strongly support the disk instability mechanism for
forming giant planets.",Astronomy

concerning the nature of the central engine of GRBs. In spite of extensive

or even impossible to infer with the spectral and lightcurve information
currently collected. Polarization measurements will lead to unambiguous answers
to several of these questions. Recent developments in X-ray and gamma-ray
polarimetry techniques have demonstrated a significant increase in sensitivity
enabling several new mission concepts, e.g. POET (Polarimeters for Energetic
Transients), providing wide field of view and broadband polarimetry
measurements. If launched, missions of this kind would finally provide
definitive measurements of GRB polarizations. We perform Monte Carlo
simulations to derive the distribution of GRB polarizations in three emission

have developed models for the planet migration and mass growth (Alibert et al.
2006) and the replenishment of warm grains (Wyatt et al. 2007). We perform
n-body integrations in order to explore the implications of these models for:
1) the excitation of planetary eccentricity, 2) the accretion and clearing of a
putative planetesimal disk, 3) the distribution of planetesimal orbits
following migration, and 4) the implications for the origin of the IR emission.
We find that: i) It is not possible to explain the observed planetary
eccentricities (e~0.1) purely as the result of planetary perturbations during
migration unless the planetary system is nearly face-on. ii) The rate of
accretion of planetesimals onto planets in our n-body simulations is
significantly different to that assumed in the semi-analytic models, suggesting
that one cannot successfully treat planetesimal accretion in the simplified
manner of Alibert et al. (2006). iii) Eccentricity damping of planetesimals
does not act as an insurmountable obstacle to the existence of an excited
eccentric disk: All simulations result in at least 25 Earth-masses of material
remaining bound in the region ~1-9 AU, even after all three planets have
migrated through the region. iv) Gas drag works to size-sort the planetesimals,
with the largest bodies preferentially occupying the highest eccentricity and
longest-lived orbits. Further work will be required to understand whether these
eccentricity distributions are high enough to explain the level of dust
emission observed despite mass loss via steady state collisional evolution.

structure of M33's neutral hydrogen. Over 18% of the HI mass of M33 (M_HI(tot)
=1.4 x 10^9 Msun) is found beyond the star forming disk as traced in the
far-ultraviolet (FUV). The most distinct features are extended warps, an arc
from the northern warp to the disk, diffuse gas surrounding the galaxy, and a
southern cloud with a filament back to the galaxy. The features extend out to
22 kpc from the galaxy center (18 kpc from the edge of the FUV disk) and the
gas is directly connected to M33's disk. Only five discrete clouds (i.e., gas
not directly connected to M33 in position-velocity space) are catalogued in the
vicinity of M33, and these clouds show similar properties to Galactic and M31
halo clouds. M33's gaseous features most likely originate from the tidal
disruption of M33 by M31 1-3 Gyr ago as shown from an orbit analysis which
results in a tidal radius &lt; 15 kpc in the majority of M33's possible orbits.
M33 is now beyond the disruptive gravitational influence of M31 and the gas
appears to be returning to M33's disk and redistributing its star formation
fuel. M33's high mean velocity dispersion in the disk (~18.5 km/s) may also be
consistent with the previous interaction and high rate of star formation. M33

both sides of the thermal dust peak. This allows us to estimate the dust
properties, including the far--IR luminosity, dust temperature, and dust mass.
We find that our sample is similar to other high-z and intermediate-z ULIRGs,

submillimeter-selected galaxies. Finally, we use existing 20cm radio continuum

430,431.0,"We present fully three-dimensional local MRI simulations with the object of
studying the excitation of non-axisymmetric spiral density waves that are
observed to always be present in such simulations. They are potentially
important for affecting protoplanetary migration through the action of
associated stochastic gravitational forces and producing residual transport in
MHD inactive regions. The simulations we perform are with zero net flux and
produce mean activity levels of alpha ~ 0.005. We reveal the nature of the
mechanism responsible for the excitation of these waves by determining the time
dependent evolution of the Fourier transforms of the participating state
variables. The dominant waves are found to have no vertical structure and to be
excited during periodically repeating swings in which they change from leading
to trailing. The initial phase of the evolution of such a swing is found to be
in excellent agreement with that expected from the WKBJ theory developed in a
preceding paper by Heinemann &amp; Papaloizou.
  We demonstrate that the important source terms causing excitation of the
waves are related to a quantity that reduces to the potential vorticity for
small perturbations from the background state with no vertical dependence. We
find that the root mean square density fluctuations associated with the waves
are positively correlated with both this quantity and the general level of
hydromagnetic turbulence. The mean angular momentum transport associated with
spiral density waves generated in our simulations is estimated to be a
significant fraction of that associated with the turbulent Reynolds stress.",Astronomy

population synthesis studies of the formation and evolution of early stars, and
calculate the resulting formation rates of short and long-duration GRBs at high

non-zero metallicity) are the most likely progenitors for both long GRBs

the predicted intrinsic rates of long and short GRBs are similar at these high

gravitational physics on cosmological scales. The excess of power seen in the
Lyman-alpha forest and small-scale CMB experiments, the anomalously large bulk

ISW cross-correlation all indicate that structure may be more evolved than
expected from LCDM. We argue that these observations find a natural explanation
in models with infinite-volume (or, at least, cosmological-size) extra
dimensions, where the graviton is a resonance with a tiny width. The
longitudinal mode of the graviton mediates an extra scalar force which speeds
up structure formation at late times, thereby accounting for the above
anomalies. The required graviton Compton wavelength is relatively small
compared to the present Hubble radius, of order 300-600 Mpc. Moreover, with
certain assumptions about the behavior of the longitudinal mode on super-Hubble
scales, our modified gravity framework can also alleviate the tension with the
low quadrupole and the peculiar vanishing of the CMB correlation function on
large angular scales, seen both in COBE and WMAP. This relies on a novel

considered, we assume that the water abundance remains homogeneous whatever the
heliocentric distance in the nebula and directly derives from a gas phase of
solar composition. Planetesimals then form in the feeding zones of Jupiter and
Saturn from the agglomeration of clathrates and pure condensates in proportions
fixed by the clathration efficiency. A fraction of Kr and Xe may have been
sequestrated by the H3+ ion in the form of stable XeH3+ and KrH3+ complexes in
the solar nebula gas phase, thus implying the formation of at least partly Xe-

range 0.6 to 0.85 Msun with that measured by Mazeh et al. for binaries in the
Carney-Latham high proper motion survey, we estimate that the frequency of
twins in a large sample of spectroscopic binaries is about 3%. Current
theoretical understanding indicates that accretion of high specific angular
momentum material by a protobinary tends to equalize its masses. We speculate
that the excess of twins is produced in those star forming regions where the
accretion processes were able to proceed to completion for a minority of
protobinaries. This predicts that the components of a young twin may appear to
differ in age and that, in a sample of spectroscopic binaries in a star
formation region, the twins are, on average, older than the binaries with mass
ratios much smaller than 1.",Astronomy
446,447.0,"We investigate the role of neutron star superfluidity for magnetar
oscillations. Using a plane-wave analysis we estimate the effects of a neutron
superfluid in the elastic crust region. We demonstrate that the superfluid
imprint is likely to be more significant than the effects of the crustal
magnetic field. We also consider the region immediately beneath the crust,
where superfluid neutrons are thought to coexist with a type II proton
superconductor. Since the magnetic field in the latter is carried by an array
of fluxtubes, the dynamics of this region differs from standard
magnetohydrodynamics. We show that the presence of the neutron superfluid
(again) leaves a clear imprint on the oscillations of the system. Taken
together, our estimates show that the superfluid components cannot be ignored
in efforts to carry out ""magnetar seismology"". This increases the level of
complexity of the modelling problem, but also points to the possibility of
using observations to probe the superfluid nature of supranuclear matter.",Astronomy

448,449.0,"(abridged) We study photoelectric heating throughout the Large Magellanic
Cloud. We quantify the importance of the [CII] cooling line and the
photoelectric heating process of various environments in the LMC and
investigate which parameters control the extent of photoelectric heating. We
use the BICE [CII] map and the Spitzer/SAGE infrared maps. We examine the
spatial variations in the efficiency of photoelectric heating: photoelectric
heating rate over power absorbed by grains. We correlate the photoelectric
heating efficiency and the emission from various dust constituents and study
the variations as a function of H\alpha emission, dust temperatures, and the
total infrared luminosity. From this we estimate radiation field, gas
temperature, and electron density. We find systematic variations in
photoelectric efficiency. The highest efficiencies are found in the diffuse
medium, while the lowest coincide with bright star-forming regions (~1.4 times
lower). The [CII] line emission constitutes 1.32% of the far infrared
luminosity across the whole of the LMC. We find correlations between the [CII]
emission and ratios of the mid infrared and far infrared bands, which comprise
various dust constituents. The correlations are interpreted in light of the
spatial variations of the dust abundance and by the local environmental
conditions that affect the dust emission properties. As a function of the total
infrared surface brightness, S_{TIR}, the [CII] surface brightness can be
described as: S_{[CII]}=1.25 S_{TIR}^{0.69} [10^{-3} erg s^{-1} cm^{-2}
sr^{-1}]. The [CII] emission is well-correlation with the 8 micrometer
emission, suggesting that the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons play a dominant
role in the photoelectric heating process.",Astronomy
449,450.0,"The source 4U 2206+54 is one of the most enigmatic high-mass X-ray binaries.
In spite of intensive searches, X-ray pulsations have not been detected in the
time range 0.001-1000 s. A cyclotron line at ~30 keV has been suggested by
various authors but never detected with significance. The stellar wind of the
optical companion is abnormally slow. The orbital period, initially reported to
be 9.6 days, disappeared and a new periodicity of 19.25 days emerged. Our new
long and uninterrupted RXTE observations allow us to search for long (~1 hr)
pulsations for the first time. We have discovered 5560-s pulsations in the
light curve of 4U 2206+54. Initially detected in RXTE data, these pulsations
are also present in INTEGRAL and EXOSAT observations. The average X-ray
luminosity in the energy range 2-10 keV is 1.5 x 10^{35} erg s^{-1} with a
ratio Fmax/Fmin ~ 5. This ratio implies an eccentricity of ~0.4, somewhat
higher than previously suggested. The source also shows a soft excess at low
energies. If the soft excess is modelled with a blackbody component, then the
size and temperature of the emitting region agrees with its interpretation in
terms of a hot spot on the neutron star surface. The source displays
variability on time scales of days, presumably due to changes in the mass
accretion rate as the neutron star moves around the optical companion in a
moderately eccentric orbit.",Astronomy

on the global scales of an interacting system of gas-rich galaxies, as well as

Small and Large Magellanic Clouds and their connecting bridge, span a range in
(low) metallicities and gas density. This allows us to study star formation
near the critical density and gain an understanding of how tidal dwarfs might
form; the low metallicity of the SMC in particular is typical of galaxies

the different environments encountered in the Magellanic System and compare
these with the Schmidt-Kennicutt law and the predicted efficiencies of various

were picked up in two-colour diagrams, in a very similar manner to candidates
extracted from the UKIDSS Large Area Survey (LAS) but taking advantage of the Z
filter employed by the GCS. Both candidates exhibit near-infrared J-band
spectra with strong methane and water absorption bands characteristic of late-T

photometric distances less than 50 pc for UGCS J030013.86+490142.5 and UGCS

GCS seems consistent with discoveries in the larger areal coverage of the
UKIDSS Large Area Survey, indicating one T dwarf in 6-11 square degrees. The
final area surveyed by the GCS, 1000 square degrees in five passbands, will
allow expansion of the LAS search area by 25%, increase the probability of

close to the hole will show a variety of strong field effects. To compute the
intensity and timing of pulses that have passed close to a nonrotating black
hole we introduce here a simple formalism based on two ""universal functions,""
one for the bending of photon trajectories and the other for the photon travel
time on these trajectories. We apply this simple formalism to the case of a
pulsar in circular orbit that beams its pulses into the orbital plane. In
addition to the ""primary"" pulses that reach the receiver by a more-or-less
direct path, we find that there are secondary and higher order pulses. These
are usually much dimmer than the primary pulses, but they can be of comparable
or even greater intensity if they are emitted when pulsar is on the side of the
hole furthest from the receiver. We show that there is a phase relationship of
the primary and secondary pulses that is a probe of the strongly curved

We study various collapse scenarios with ""arbitrary"" angular momentum for a
variety of geometric configurations, including anti-de Sitter, de Sitter, and
flat spaces. We find that the collapsing shells can form a BTZ black hole, a
three-dimensional Kerr-dS spacetime, and an horizonless geometry of point
masses under certain initial conditions. For pressureless dust shells, the
curvature singularity is ""not"" formed due to the angular momentum barrier near
the origin. However when the shell pressure is nonvanishing, we find that for
all types of shells with polytropic-type equations of state (including the

existence of light sterile neutrinos, a few anomalies persist in oscillation
data, and the possibility of extra light species contributing as a subdominant

temperature as active neutrinos, but this is not necessarily the case. In this
work, we fit up-to-date cosmological data with an extended LambdaCDM model,
including light relics with a mass typically in the range 0.1 -10 eV. We
provide, first, some nearly model-independent constraints on their current
density and velocity dispersion, and second, some constraints on their mass,
assuming that they consist either in early decoupled thermal relics, or in
non-resonantly produced sterile neutrinos. Our results can be used for
constraining most particle-physics-motivated models with three active neutrinos

with the data provided that it is thermally distributed with (T_s/T_nu) &lt; 0.8,

Fe I at \lambda5233\AA since this latter line has a broad shape with a profile
that is nearly linear over a large portion of its wings. The present study uses
five pairs of sampling points on the $\lambda5233$\AA line. We recommend
adoption of the field determined with a line bisector method with a sampling

with sources that are only non-zero in the presence of turbulent fluctuations.
We solve these in a shearing box domain using a WKBJ method. It is found that,
for a particular azimuthal wave length, the wave excitation occurs through a
sequence of regularly spaced swings during which the wave changes from leading
to trailing form. This is a generic process that is expected to occur in
shearing discs with turbulence. Trailing waves of equal amplitude propagating
in opposite directions are produced, both of which produce an outward angular
momentum flux that we give expressions for as functions of the disc parameters
and azimuthal wave length.
  By solving the wave amplitude equations numerically we justify the WKBJ
approach for a Keplerian rotation law for all parameter regimes of interest. In
order to quantify the wave excitation completely the important wave source
terms need to be specified. Assuming conditions of weak nonlinearity, these can
be identified and are associated with a quantity related to the potential
vorticity, being the only survivors in the linear regime. Under the additional

for a fairly broad range of accretion rates and stellar rotation rates and
magnetic fields. It produces tall, thin tongues of plasma that penetrate the
magnetosphere in the equatorial plane. The shape and number of the tongues
changes with time on the inner-disk dynamical timescale. In contrast with
funnel flows, which deposit matter mainly in the polar region, the tongues
deposit matter much closer to the stellar equator. The instability appears for
relatively small misalignment angles, $\Theta\lesssim30^\circ$, between the
star's rotation and magnetic axes, and is associated with higher accretion
rates. The hot spots and light curves during accretion through instability are
generally much more chaotic than during stable accretion. The unstable state of

intermittent pulsations from accreting systems.",Astronomy
474,475.0,"Although quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) have been discovered in different
X-ray sources, their origin is still a matter of debate. Analytical studies of
hydrodynamic accretion disks have shown three types of trapped global modes
with properties that appear to agree with the observations. However, these
studies take only linear effects into account and do not address the issues of
mode excitation and decay. Moreover, observations suggest that resonances
between modes play a crucial role. A systematic, numerical study of this
problem is therefore needed. In this paper, we use a pseudo-spectral algorithm
to perform a parameter study of the inner regions of hydrodynamic disks. By
assuming alpha-viscosity, we show that steady state solutions rarely exist. The
inner edges of the disks oscillate and excite axisymmetric waves. In addition,
the flows inside the inner edges are sometimes unstable to non-axisymmetric
perturbations. One-armed, or even two-armed, spirals are developed, which
provides a plausible explanation for the high-frequency QPOs observed from
accreting black holes. When the Reynolds numbers are above certain critical
values, the inner disks go through some transient turbulent states
characterized by strong trailing spirals; while large-scale leading spirals
developed in the outer disks. We compared our numerical results with standard

476,477.0,"Spectroscopy of planetary nebulae (PNe) provides the means to investigate
s-process enrichments of neutron(n)-capture elements that cannot be detected in
asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. However, accurate abundance determinations
of these elements present a challenge. Corrections for unobserved ions can be
large and uncertain, since in many PNe only one ion of a given n-capture
element has been detected. Furthermore, the atomic data governing the
ionization balance of these species are not well-determined, inhibiting the
derivation of accurate ionization corrections. We present initial results of a
program that addresses these challenges. Deep high resolution optical
spectroscopy of ~20 PNe has been performed to detect emission lines from
trans-iron species including Se, Br, Kr, Rb, and Xe. The optical spectral
region provides access to multiple ions of these elements, which reduces the
magnitude and importance of uncertainties in the ionization corrections. In
addition, experimental and theoretical efforts are providing determinations of
the photoionization cross-sections and recombination rate coefficients of Se,
Kr, and Xe ions. These new atomic data will make it possible to derive robust
ionization corrections for these elements. Together, our observational and
atomic data results will enable n-capture element abundances to be determined

the proton and its branching modes. We point out that several astrophysical

lifetime ~ 10^26 sec. Interestingly, this timescale is now being investigated
in several experiments including ATIC, PAMELA, HESS, and Fermi. Positive
evidence for such decays may be opening our first direct window to physics at
the supersymmetric unification scale of M_GUT ~ 10^16 GeV, as well as the TeV
scale. Moreover, in the same supersymmetric unified theories, dimension five
operators can lead a weak-scale superparticle to decay with a lifetime of ~ 100
sec. Such decays are recorded by a change in the primordial light element
abundances and may well explain the present discord between the measured Li

of Higgs fields that break the B-L around one TeV. The dominant mode of dark
matter annihilation is to the lightest of the new Higgs fields, which has a

the interstellar (IS) dust by a hot star passing through a diffuse IS cloud.
This model is applied to six lambda Bootis stars with infrared excesses.
Plausible values for the IS medium (ISM) density and relative velocity between
the cloud and the star yield fits to the excess emission. This result is
consistent with the diffusion/accretion hypothesis that lambda Bootis stars (A-
to F-type stars with large underabundances of Fe-peak elements) owe their
characteristics to interactions with the ISM. This proposal invokes radiation
pressure from the star to repel the IS dust and excavate a paraboloidal dust
cavity in the IS cloud, while the metal-poor gas is accreted onto the stellar
photosphere. However, the measurements of the infrared excesses can also be fit
by planetary debris disk models. A more detailed consideration of the
conditions to produce lambda Bootis characteristics indicates that the majority
of infrared-excess stars within the Local Bubble probably have debris disks.
Nevertheless, more distant stars may often have excesses due to heating of

turbulent at the core centre. SMM1 North has no infrared counterparts and shows
lower levels of turbulence, but also drives an outflow. Both outflows appear

three-dimensional numerical simulations. This is the first attempt to test a
model of fast magnetic reconnection proposed by Lazarian &amp; Vishniac (1999),
which assumes the presence of weak, small-scale magnetic field structure near
the current sheet. This affects the rate of reconnection by reducing the
transverse scale for reconnection flows and by allowing many independent flux
reconnection events to occur simultaneously. We performed a number of
simulations to test the dependencies of the reconnection speed, defined as the
ratio of the inflow velocity to the Alfven speed, on the turbulence power, the
injection scale and resistivity. Our results show that turbulence significantly
affects the topology of magnetic field near the diffusion region and increases
the thickness of the outflow region. We confirm the predictions of the Lazarian

proportional to ~ V^2, where V is the amplitude of velocity at the injection
scale. It depends on the injection scale l as ~ (l/L)^(2/3), where L is the
size of the system, which is somewhat faster but still roughly consistent with

Our major findings are as follows. First, we find that magnetohydrodynamic
(MHD) turbulence in the Galaxy can indeed explain diffuse synchrotron emission
from high galactic latitude. Our model calculation suggests that either a
one-component extended halo model or a two-component model, an extended halo
component (scale height &gt; 1kpc) plus a local component, can explain the
observed angular spectrum of the synchrotron emission. However, discrete
sources seem to dominate the spectrum for regions near the Galactic plane.
Second, we study how star-light polarization is related with polarized emission
from thermal dust. We also discuss the expected angular spectrum of polarized
emission from thermal dust. Our model calculations suggest that C_l\propto

relaxed regions but spans four orders of magnitude in the outskirts, both
because of the presence of subhaloes as well as of underdense regions and holes

ellipsoid is aligned with the shape ellipsoid of the halo. This is not true in
the outer parts where the orientation becomes more isotropic. The clumpy

have been measured or will have been measured in the next several years. And
the set must be large enough to accurately approximate the large set of
candidate EOSs. We find that a parameterized EOS based on piecewise polytropes
with 3 free parameters matches to about 4% rms error an extensive set of
candidate EOSs at densities below the central density of 1.4 solar mass stars.
Adding observations of more massive stars constrains the higher density part of
the EOS and requires an additional parameter. We obtain constraints on the
allowed parameter space set by causality and by present and near-future
astronomical observations. In particular, we emphasize potentially stringent
constraints on the EOS parameter space associated with two measured properties
of a single star; and we find that a measurement of the moment of inertia of

the range in which 3D-atmosphere treatment is necessary and where 1D-atmosphere

orbital motion of RS Gru with a semi-amplitude of ~6.5 km/s and 11.5 days

amplitude of the secondary frequency is variable on the time-scale of a few

Hinode observations, we study effects of turbulence on measuring the solar
magnetic field outside active regions. Firstly, from synthetic Stokes V
profiles for the FeI lines at 630.1 and 630.2 nm, we show that a peaked
probability distribution function (PDF) for observationally-derived field
estimates is consistent with a monotonic PDF for actual vertical field
strengths. Hence, the prevalence of weak fields is greater than would be
naively inferred from observations. Secondly, we employ the fractal
self-similar geometry of the turbulent solar magnetic field to derive two
estimates (numerical and observational) of the true mean vertical unsigned flux
density. We also find observational evidence that the scales of magnetic
structuring in the photosphere extend at least down to an order of magnitude
smaller than 200 km: the self-similar power-law scaling in the signed measure
from a Hinode magnetogram ranges (over two decades in length scales and
including the granulation scale) down to the 200 km resolution limit. From the
self-similar scaling, we determine a lower bound for the true quiet-Sun mean
vertical unsigned flux density of ~50 G. This is consistent with our
numerically-based estimates that 80% or more of the vertical unsigned flux
should be invisible to Stokes-V observations at a resolution of 200 km owing to
the cancellation of signal from opposite magnetic polarities. Our estimates

find that most pairs can survive for the situations obtained in our previous

the environment attributed to the nearest neighbor galaxy using the SDSS

characteristic scale where the properties of galaxies suddenly start to depend
on the clustercentric radius at fixed neighbor environment. The characteristic
scale is $1\sim 3$ times the cluster virial radius depending on galaxy
luminosity. Existence of the characteristic scale means that the local galaxy
number density is not directly responsible for the morphology-density relation
in clusters because the local density varies smoothly with the clustercentric
radius and has no discontinuity in general. What is really working in clusters
is the morphology-clustercentric radius-neighbor environment relation, where
the neighbor environment means both neighbor morphology and the local mass
density attributed to the neighbor. The morphology-density relation appears
working only because of the statistical correlation between the nearest
neighbor distance and the local galaxy number density. We find strong evidence
that the hydrodynamic interactions with nearby early-type galaxies is the main
drive to quenching star formation activity of late-type galaxies in clusters.
The hot cluster gas seems to play at most a minor role down to one tenth of the
cluster virial radius. We also find that the viable mechanisms which can
account for the clustercentric radius dependence of the structural and internal
kinematics parameters are harassment and interaction of galaxies with the

J0152.7-1357. We use the colors of galaxies, assembled from a D~12 Mpc region
centered on the cluster, to investigate the properties of the red-sequence as a
function of density and clustercentric radius. Our wide-field multi-slit survey
with a low-dispersion prism in the IMACS spectrograph at Magellan allowed us to
identify 475 new members of the cluster and its surrounding large scale
structure with a redshift accuracy of dz/(1+z)~1% and a contamination rate of
~2% for galaxies with i&lt;23.75 mag. We combine these new members with the 279
previously known spectroscopic members to give a total of 754 galaxies from
which we obtain a mass-limited sample of 300 galaxies with stellar masses
M&gt;4x10^{10} M_sun. We find that the red galaxy fraction is 93+/-3% in the two
merging cores of the cluster and declines to a level of 64+/-3% at projected
clustercentric radii R&gt;~3 Mpc. At these large projected distances, the
correlation between clustercentric radius and local density is nonexistent.
This allows an assessment of the influence of the local environment on galaxy
evolution, as opposed to mechanisms that operate on cluster scales. Even beyond
R&gt;3 Mpc we find an increasing fraction of red galaxies with increasing local
density. The red fraction at the highest local densities in two groups at R&gt;3
Mpc matches the red fraction found in the two cores. Strikingly, galaxies at
intermediate densities at R&gt;3 Mpc, that are not group members, also show signs
of an enhanced red fraction. Our results point to such intermediate density
regions and the groups in the outskirts of the cluster, as sites where the
local environment influences the transition of galaxies onto the red-sequence.",Astronomy
511,512.0,"Concurrent observations of Lyman continuum (LyC) and Lyman-alpha (Lya)
emission escaping from star-forming systems at low redshift are essential to
understanding the physics of reionization at high redshift (z &gt;~ 6). Some have
suggested reionization is dominated by numerous small galaxies with LyC escape
fractions f_e ~ 10%, while others suggest mini-quasars with higher f_e might
also play a role. At z &gt; 3, direct observation of LyC leakage becomes
progressively more improbable due to the increase of intervening Ly limit
systems, leaving Lya as the primary diagnostic available to the James Webb
Space Telescope for exploring the epoch of reionization. If a quantitative
relationship between escaping LyC and Lya emission can be established at low z,
then the diagnostic power of Lya as a LyC proxy at high z can be fully
realized. Past efforts to detect f_e near z ~ 3 have been fruitful but
observations at low redshift have been less so. We discuss the sensitivity
requirements for detecting LyC leak in the far- and near-UV as a function of
redshift 0.02 &lt; z ~&lt; 3 and f_e &gt;= 0.01 as estimated from UV luminosity
functions. UV observations are essential to understanding of the physics of LyC
escape and the ultimate goal of identifying the source(s) responsible for
reionization.",Astronomy
512,513.0,"Based on deep imaging from the Advanced Camera for Surveys aboard the Hubble
Space Telescope, we present new evidence that stellar feedback created a ~ 1
kpc supergiant HI shell (SGS) and triggered star formation (SF) around its rim
in the M81 Group dwarf irregular galaxy IC 2574. Using photometry of the
resolved stars from the HST images, we measure the star formation history of a
region including the SGS, focusing on the past 500 Myr, and employ the unique
properties of blue helium burning stars to create a movie of SF in the SGS. We
find two significant episodes of SF inside the SGS from 200 - 300 Myr and ~ 25
Myr ago. Comparing the timing of the SF events to the dynamic age of the SGS

feedback is responsible for creating the SGS and triggering secondary SF around
its rim.",Astronomy
513,514.0,"We use photometric data from Spitzer to explore the mid- and far-IR
properties of 10 red QSOs (J-K&gt;2, R-K&gt;5) selected by combining the 2MASS in the
NIR with the SDSS at optical wavelengths. Optical and/or near-infrared spectra
are available for 8/10 sources. Modeling the SED from UV to far-IR shows that
moderate dust reddening (A_V=1.3-3.2) can explain the red optical and near-IR
colours of the sources in the sample. There is also evidence that red QSOs have
60/12micron luminosity ratio higher than PG QSOs (97% significance). This can
be interpreted as a higher level of star-formation in these systems (measured
by the 60micron luminosity) for a given AGN power (approximated by the 12micron
luminosity). This is consistent with a picture where red QSOs represent an
early phase of AGN evolution, when the supermassive black hole is enshrouded in
dust and gas clouds, which will eventually be blown out (possibly by AGN driven
outflows) and the system will appear as typical optically luminous QSO. There
is also tentative evidence significant at the 96% level that red 2MASS QSOs are
more often associated with radio emission than optically selected SDSS QSOs.
This may indicate outflows, also consistent with the young AGN interpretation.
We also estimate the space density of red QSOs relative to optically selected
SDSS QSOs, taking into account the effect of dust extinction and the intrinsic
luminosity of the sources. We estimate that the fraction of red QSOs in the
overall population increases from 3% at M_K=-27.5mag to 12% at M_K=-29.5mag.
This suggests that reddened QSOs become more important at the bright end of the
Luminosity Function. If red QSOs are transition objects on the way to becoming
typical optically luminous QSOs, the low fractions above suggest that these
systems spent &lt;12% of their lifetime at the ""reddened"" stage.",Astronomy
514,515.0,"(Abridged) We study the stellar populations of 14 elliptical galaxies in the
Virgo cluster. We propose an alternative approach to the standard side-band
method to measure equivalent widths (EWs). Our Boosted Median Continuum maps
the EWs more robustly than the side-band method, minimising the effect from
neighbouring absorption lines and reducing the age-metallicity degeneracy. We
concentrate on Balmer lines (Hbeta,Hgamma,Hdelta), the G band and the 4000A
break as age-sensitive indicators, and on the combination [MgFe] as the main
metallicity indicator. We go beyond the standard comparison of the observations
with simple stellar populations (SSP) and consider various models to describe
the star formation histories, either with a continuous star formation rate or
with a mixture of two different SSPs. Composite models are found to give more
consistent fits among individual line strengths and agree with an independent
estimate using the spectral energy distribution. Our age and metallicity
estimates correlate well with stellar mass or velocity dispersion, with a
significant threshold around 5E10 Msun above which galaxies are uniformly old
and metal rich. In a more speculative way, our models suggest that it is
formation **epoch** and not formation timescale what drives the Mass-Age

516,517.0,"We present a pair of high-resolution smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH)
simulations that explore the evolution and cooling behavior of hot gas around
Milky-Way size galaxies. The simulations contain the same total baryonic mass
and are identical other than their initial gas density distributions. The first
is initialised with a low entropy hot gas halo that traces the cuspy profile of
the dark matter, and the second is initialised with a high-entropy hot halo
with a cored density profile as might be expected in models with pre-heating
feedback. Galaxy formation proceeds in dramatically different fashion depending
on the initial setup. While the low-entropy halo cools rapidly, primarily from
the central region, the high-entropy halo is quasi-stable for ~4 Gyr and
eventually cools via the fragmentation and infall of clouds from ~100 kpc
distances. The low-entropy halo's X-ray surface brightness is ~100 times
brighter than current limits and the resultant disc galaxy contains more than
half of the system's baryons. The high-entropy halo has an X-ray brightness
that is in line with observations, an extended distribution of
pressure-confined clouds reminiscent of observed populations, and a final disc
galaxy that has half the mass and ~50% more specific angular momentum than the
disc formed in the low-entropy simulation. The final high-entropy system
retains the majority of its baryons in a low-density hot halo. The hot halo
harbours a trace population of cool, mostly ionised, pressure-confined clouds
that contain ~10% of the halo's baryons after 10 Gyr of cooling. The covering
fraction for HI and MgII absorption clouds in the high-entropy halo is ~0.4 and
~0.6, respectively, although most of the mass that fuels disc growth is

517,518.0,"Aims. We present the results from a comprehensive spectroscopic survey of the
WINGS (WIde-field Nearby Galaxy-cluster Survey) clusters, a program called
WINGS-SPE. The WINGS-SPE sample consists of 48 clusters, 22 of which are in the
southern sky and 26 in the north. The main goals of this spectroscopic survey
are: (1) to study the dynamics and kinematics of the WINGS clusters and their
constituent galaxies, (2) to explore the link between the spectral properties
and the morphological evolution in different density environments and across a
wide range in cluster X-ray luminosities and optical properties. Methods. Using
multi object fiber fed spectrographs, we observed our sample of WINGS cluster
galaxies at an intermediate resolu- tion of 6-9 A and, using a
cross-correlation technique, we measured redshifts with a mean accuracy of
about 45 km/s. Results. We present redshift measurements for 6137 galaxies and
their first analyses. Details of the spectroscopic observations are reported.
The WINGS-SPE has about 30% overlap with previously published data sets,
allowing us to do both a complete comparison with the literature and to extend
the catalogs. Conclusions. Using our redshifts, we calculate the velocity
dispersion for all the clusters in the WINGS-SPE sample. We almost trip- licate
the number of member galaxies known in each cluster with respect to previous
works. We also investigate the X-ray luminosity vs. velocity dispersion
relation for our WINGS-SPE clusters, and find it to be consistent with the form
Lx proportional to sigma^4.",Astronomy
518,519.0,"The observed intergalactic OVI absorbers at z&gt;0 have been regarded as a
significant reservoir of the ``missing baryons''. However, to fully understand
how these absorbers contribute to the baryon inventory, it is crucial to
determine whether the systems are collisionally ionized or photoionized (or
both). Using the identified intergalactic OVI absorbers as tracers, we search
for the corresponding X-ray absorption lines, which are useful for finding the
missing baryons and for revealing the nature of the OVI absorbers. Stacking the
Chandra grating spectra along six AGN sight lines, we obtain three spectra with
signal-to-noise ratios of 32, 28, and 10 per 12.5 mA spectral bin around the
expected OVII Kalpha wavelength. These spectra correspond to OVI absorbers with
various dynamic properties. We find no detectable NeIX, OVII, OVIII, NVII, or
CVI absorption lines in the spectra, but the high counting statistics allows us
to obtain firm upper limits on the corresponding ionic column densities (in
particular N(OVII)&lt;=10 N(OVI) on average at the 95% confidence level). Jointly
analyzing these non-detected X-ray lines with the averaged OVI column density,
we further limit the average temperature of the OVI-bearing gas to be

time-series light curves and an analysis of the period-color plane for stars in
the field of the open cluster NGC2301. One hundred thirty-eight periodic
variables were discovered, of which five are eclipsing binary candidates with
unequal minima. The remaining 133 periodic variables appear to consist mainly
of late-type stars whose variation is due to rotation modulated by star spot
activity. The determined periods range from less than a day to over 14 days and
have nearly unreddened B-R colors in the range of 0.8 to 2.8. The Barnes (2003)
interpretation of the period-color plane of late type stars is tested with our

field stars contaminating in the background, as we estimate the total
contamination to be 43%. Using different assumptions, the gyrochronological age
of the cluster is calculated to be 210+/-25 Myr, which falls in the range of

522,523.0,"(abridged) Aims: To study turbulent transport coefficients that describe the
evolution of large-scale magnetic fields in turbulent convection. Methods: We
use the test field method together with 3D numerical simulations of turbulent
convection with shear and rotation to compute turbulent transport coefficients
describing the evolution of large-scale magnetic fields in mean-field theory in
the kinematic regime. 1D mean-field models are used with the derived turbulent
transport coefficients to compare with direct simulations. Results: The
alpha-effect increases monotonically as rotation increases. Turbulent
diffusivity, eta_t, is proportional to the square of the turbulent vertical
velocity. Whereas eta_t decreases approximately inversely proportional to the
wavenumber of the field, the alpha-effect and turbulent pumping show a more
complex behaviour. In the presence of shear and no rotation a small
alpha-effect is induced which does not seem to show any consistent trend as a
function of shear. If the shear is large enough, this small alpha is able to
excite a dynamo in the mean-field model. The coefficient responsible for
driving the shear-current effect shows several sign changes as a function of
depth but is also able to contribute to dynamo action in the mean-field model.
The growth rates in these cases are well below those in direct simulations
suggesting that an incoherent alpha-shear dynamo may also act in them. If both
rotation and shear are present, the alpha-effect is more pronounced. The
combination of the shear-current and Omega x J-effects is also stronger than in
the case of shear only, but subdominant to the alpha-shear dynamo. The results
of direct simulations are consistent with mean-field models where all of these
effects are taken into account without the need to invoke incoherent effects.",Astronomy

micron image indicates that L328 consists of three subcores of which the
smallest one may harbor a source, L328-IRS while two other subcores remain
starless. L328-IRS is a Class 0 protostar according to its bolometric
temperature (44 K) and the high fraction ~72 % of its luminosity emitted at
sub-millimeter wavelengths. Its inferred ""internal luminosity"" (0.04 - 0.06
Lsun) using a radiative transfer model under the most plausible assumption of
its distance as 200 pc is much fainter than for a typical protostar, and even
fainter than other VeLLOs studied previously. Note, however, that its inferred
luminosity may be uncertain by a factor of 2-3 if we consider two extreme
values of the distance of L328-IRS (125 or 310 pc). Low angular resolution
observations of CO do not show any clear evidence of a molecular outflow
activity. But broad line widths toward L328, and Spitzer and near-infrared
images showing nebulosity possibly tracing an outflow cavity, strongly suggest
the existence of outflow activity. Provided that an envelope of at most ~0.1
Msunis the only mass accretion reservoir for L328-IRS, and the star formation

often misrepresented as statistical effects and the approach of marginalising
over extra nuisance systematic parameters is used to gauge the effect of the
systematic. In this article we argue that such an approach is risky at best
since the key choice of function can have a large effect on the resultant
cosmological errors. As an alternative we present a functional form filling
technique in which an unknown, residual, systematic is treated as such. Since
the underlying function is unknown we evaluate the effect of every functional
form allowed by the information available (either a hard boundary or some
data). Using a simple toy model we introduce the formalism of functional form
filling. We show that parameter errors can be dramatically affected by the
choice of function in the case of marginalising over a systematic, but that in
contrast the functional form filling approach is independent of the choice of
basis set. We then apply the technique to cosmic shear shape measurement

overview, we will summarize basic concepts from the Langevin theory of

electromagnetism. We show that a temporal electromagnetic field on cosmological
scales generates an effective cosmological constant and that primordial
electromagnetic quantum fluctuations produced during electroweak scale
inflation could naturally explain, not only the presence of this field, but
also the measured value of the dark energy density. The theory is compatible
with all the local gravity tests, and is free from classical or quantum

quiet Sun regions the supergranular structures are tracked, while in the
regions with the magnetic field the structures of the magnetic field are
dominant. This observation seems obvious, because the nature of Doppler
structures is different in the magnetic regions and in the quiet Sun. We show

radial structure of nearby AGN tori. These putative tori have been studied with
long-baseline infrared (IR) interferometry, but the spatial scales probed are
different for different objects. They are at various distances and also have
different physical sizes which apparently scale with the luminosity of the
central engine. Here we look at interferometric visibilities as a function of
spatial scales normalized by the size of the inner torus radius R_in. This
approximately eliminates luminosity and distance dependence and, thus, provides
a way to uniformly view the visibilities observed for various objects and at
different wavelengths. We can construct a composite visibility curve over a
large range of spatial scales if different tori share a common radial
structure. The currently available observations do suggest model-independently
a common radial surface brightness distribution in the mid-IR that is roughly
of a power-law form r^-2 as a function of radius r, and extends to ~100 times
R_in. Taking into account the temperature decrease toward outer radii with a

irregular variability caused by the star's circumstellar dust disk. The two

538,539.0,"Motivated by the possibility of inflation in the cosmic landscape, which may
be approximated by a complicated potential, we study the density perturbations
in multi-field inflation with a random potential. The random potential causes
the inflaton to undergo a Brownian motion with a drift in the D-dimensional
field space. To quantify such an effect, we employ a stochastic approach to
evaluate the two-point and three-point functions of primordial perturbations.
We find that in the weakly random scenario the resulting power spectrum
resembles that of the single field slow-roll case, with up to 2% more red tilt.
The strongly random scenario, leads to rich phenomenologies, such as primordial
fluctuations in the power spectrum on all angular scales. Such features may
already be hiding in the error bars of observed CMB TT (as well as TE and EE)
power spectrum and can be detected or falsified with more data coming in the
future. The tensor power spectrum itself is free of fluctuations and the tensor
to scalar ratio is enhanced. In addition a large negative running of the power
spectral index is possible. Non-Gaussianity is generically suppressed by the
growth of adiabatic perturbations on super-horizon scales, but can possibly be
enhanced by resonant effects or arise from the entropic perturbations during
the onset of (p)reheating. The formalism developed in this paper can be applied
to a wide class of multi-field inflation models including, e.g. the N-flation
scenario.",Astronomy

540,541.0,"In this paper we report a possible GeV counterpart observed at ground level
as muons (or ""photo-muons"") of two Fermi gamma burst monitor (GBM) events,
trigger bn081120618 and trigger bn081124060. In both cases, the trigger
coordinates are within the field of view of the vertical Tupi telescope located
at sea level and inside the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) region. We show that
despite the first trigger being classified as GRB (due to a gamma ray burst),
with an 100% probability assigned by GBM Flight Software, the trigger time
14:49:31 UT happened during particle precipitations in the SAA, which in most
cases is $\sim 12h$ UT to $\sim 22h$ UT, and the probability of the trigger
being attributed to particle precipitation, according to our analysis is 25%.
The second Fermi trigger is also classified as GRB, with a 100% probability
assigned by GBM Flight Software. The trigger time is 01:26:07 UT, which is
outside the schedule of precipitation of particles. Another important observed
characteristic is the existence of a ground level enhancement (GLE) with a
sharp peak ($5.1\sigma$) coinciding with the Fermi trigger within the 10-second
counting interval (raw data) of the vertical Tupi telescope. In addition it is
possible to identify other GLEs before and after the trigger occurrence. In

542,543.0,"The DAMA collaboration have claimed to detect particle dark matter (DM) via
an annual modulation in their observed recoil event rate. This appears to be in
strong disagreement with the null results of other experiments if interpreted
in terms of elastic DM scattering, while agreement for a small region of
parameter space is possible for inelastic DM (iDM) due to the altered
kinematics of the collision. To date most analyses assume a simple galactic
halo DM velocity distribution, the Standard Halo Model, but direct experimental
support for the SHM is severely lacking and theoretical studies indicate
possible significant differences. We investigate the dependence of DAMA and the
other direct detection experiments on the local DM velocity distribution,
utilizing the results of the Via Lactea and Dark Disc numerical simulations. We
also investigate effects of varying the solar circular velocity, the DM escape
velocity, and the DAMA quenching factor within experimental limits. Our data
set includes the latest ZEPLIN-III results, as well as full publicly available
data sets. Due to the more sensitive dependence of the inelastic cross section
on the velocity distribution, we find that with Via Lactea the DAMA results can
be consistent with all other experiments over an enlarged region of iDM
parameter space, with higher mass particles being preferred, while Dark Disc
does not lead to an improvement. A definitive test of DAMA for iDM requires
heavy element detectors.",Astronomy
543,544.0,"Gaseous H2O has been detected in several cold astrophysical environments,
where the observed abundances cannot be explained by thermal desorption of H2O
ice or by H2O gas phase formation. These observations hence suggest an
efficient non-thermal ice desorption mechanism. Here, we present experimentally
determined UV photodesorption yields of H2O and D2O ice and deduce their
photodesorption mechanism. The ice photodesorption is studied under ultra high
vacuum conditions and at astrochemically relevant temperatures (18-100 K) using
a hydrogen discharge lamp (7-10.5 eV), which simulates the interstellar UV
field. The ice desorption during irradiation is monitored using reflection
absorption infrared spectroscopy of the ice and simultaneous mass spectrometry
of the desorbed species. The photodesorption yield per incident photon is
identical for H2O and D2O and depends on both ice thickness and temperature.
For ices thicker than 8 monolayers the photodesorption yield Y is linearly
dependent on temperature due to increased diffusion of ice species such that
Y(T) = 1E-3(1.3+0.032*T) UV photon-1, with a 60% uncertainty for the absolute
yield. The increased diffusion also results in an increasing H2O:OH desorption
product ratio with temperature. The yield does not depend on the substrate, the
UV photon flux or the UV fluence. The yield is also independent on the initial
ice structure since UV photons efficiently amorphize H2O ice. The results are
consistent with theoretical predictions of H2O photodesorption and partly in
agreement with a previous experimental study. Applying the experimentally
determined yield to a Herbig Ae/Be star+disk model shows that UV
photodesorption of ices increases the H2O content by orders of magnitude in the
disk surface region compared to models where non-thermal desorption is ignored.",Astronomy

central point is hidden inside of an event horizon independently on the mass
and charge of the object. We obtained the relationships between the non-minimal
coupling constants, for which this requirement is satisfied. As explicit

loops taking into account the azimuthal magnetic fields. We neglect stellar
rotation and assume axisymmetry and a purely radial flow. As the magnetic loops
expand, the initial dipole magnetic field is stretched into the radial
direction. When the expansion speed approaches the light speed, the
displacement current reduces the toroidal current and modifies the distribution
of the plasma lifted up from the central star. Since these self-similar
solutions describe the free expansion of the magnetic loops, i.e., $Dv/Dt=0$,
the equations of motion are similar to those of the static relativistic
magnetohydrodynamics. This allows us to estimate the total energy stored in the
magnetic loops by applying the virial theorem. This energy is comparable to
that of the giant flares observed in magnetars.",Astronomy
546,547.0,"Cosmic rays accelerated by a shock form a streaming distribution of outgoing
particles in the foreshock region. If the ambient fields are negligible
compared to the shock and cosmic ray energetics, a stronger magnetic field can
be generated in the shock upstream via the streaming (Weibel-type) instability.
Here we develop a self-similar model of the foreshock region and calculate its
structure, e.g., the magnetic field strength, its coherence scale, etc., as a
function of the distance from the shock. Our model indicates that the entire
foreshock region of thickness $\sim R/(2\Gamma_{\rm sh}^2)$, being comparable
to the shock radius in the late afterglow phase when $\Gamma_{\rm sh}\sim1$,
can be populated with large-scale and rather strong magnetic fields (of
sub-gauss strengths with the coherence length of order $10^{17} {\rm cm}$)
compared to the typical interstellar medium magnetic fields. The presence of
such fields in the foreshock region is important for high efficiency of Fermi
acceleration at the shock. Radiation from accelerated electrons in the
foreshock fields can constitute a separate emission region radiating in the
UV/optical through radio band, depending on time and shock parameters. We also
speculate that these fields being eventually transported into the shock
downstream can greatly increase radiative efficiency of a gamma-ray burst

548,549.0,"The hard X-ray emission of active galactic nuclei (AGN) is believed to
originate from the hot coronae above the cold accretion discs. The hard X-ray
spectral index is found to be correlated with the Eddington ratio, and the hard
X-ray bolometric correction factor L_bol/L_x increases with the Eddington
ratio. The Compton reflection is also found to be correlated with the hard
X-ray spectral index. These observational features provide very useful
constraints on the accretion disc-corona model for AGN. We construct an
accretion disc-corona model and calculate the spectra with different magnetic
stress tensors in the cold discs, in which the corona is assumed to be heated
by the reconnection of the magnetic fields generated by buoyancy instability in
the cold accretion disc. Our calculations show that the magnetic stress tensor
\alpha p_gas fails to explain all these observational features, while \alpha
p_tot always leads to constant L_bol/L_x independent of the Eddington ratio.
The resulted spectra of the disc-corona systems with \alpha (p_gas p_tot)^1/2
show that both the hard X-ray spectral index and the hard X-ray bolometric
correction factor L_bol/L_x increase with the Eddington ratio, which are
qualitatively consistent with the observations. We find that the disc-corona
model is unable to reproduce the observed very hard X-ray continuum emission
from the sources accreting at low rates, which may imply the different
accretion mode in these low luminosity sources. We suggest that the disc-corona
system transits to an advection-dominated accretion flow+disc corona system at
low accretion rates, which may be able to explain all the above-mentioned
correlations.",Astronomy

White Dwarf component. The dust content of the system was severely affected by

geometry of the dust envelope. We test our previous spectro-interferometric
study of this system with new interferometric configurations, increasing the uv

that the data can be reproduced well by an optically thick dust shell of
amorphous silicate, typical of those encountered around Mira stars, whose
measured dimension increases from 8 to 13micron. We confirm that the envelope

The first class has been previously investigated, but we define new variables

shock-cloud interaction features. We chose three representative regions, and
analyzed their IRC emissions through comparison with H2 line emissions of
several shock models. The IRC colors are well explained by the thermal
admixture model of H2 gas--whose infinitesimal H2 column density has a
power-law relation with the temperature T, dN ~ T^-b dT--with n(H2) ~ 10^3
cm^-3, b ~ 3, and N(H2 ;T &gt; 100K) ~ 3x10^20 cm^-2. The derived b value may be
understood by a bow shock picture, whose shape is cycloidal (cuspy) rather than
paraboloidal. However, this picture raises another issue that the bow shocks
must reside within ~0.01 pc size-scale, smaller than the theoretically
expected. Instead, we conjectured a shocked clumpy interstellar medium picture,
which may avoid the sizescale issue while explaining the similar model
parameters. The observed H2 v = 1 -&gt; 0 S(1) intensities are a factor of ~17 -
33 greater than the prediction from the power-law admixture model. This excess
may be attributed to either an extra component of hot H2 gas or to the effects
of collisions with hydrogen atoms, omitted in our power-law admixture model,
both of which would increase the population in the v = 1 level of H2.",Astronomy
554,555.0,"We present a new prediction of GeV $\gamma$-ray emission from radio lobes of
young AGN jets. In the previous work of Kino et al. (2007), MeV $\gamma$-ray
bremsstrahlung emission was predicted from young cocoons/radio-lobes in the
regime of no coolings. In this study, we include cooling effects of
bremsstrahlung emission and adiabatic loss. With the initial conditions
determined by observed young radio lobes, we solve a set of equations
describing the expanding lobe evolution. Then we find that the lobes initially
have electron temperature of $\sim$GeV, and they cool down to $\sim$MeV by the
adiabatic loss. Correspondingly, the lobes initially yield bright
bremsstrahlung luminosity in $\sim$GeV range and they fade out. We estimate
these $\gamma$-ray emissions and show that nearby young radio lobes could be

555,556.0,"We use numerical simulations of turbulent, multiphase, self-gravitating gas
orbiting in model disk galaxies to study the relationships among pressure, the
vertical gas distribution, and the ratio of dense to diffuse gas. We show that
the disk height and mean midplane pressure are consistent with effective
hydrostatic equilibrium, provided that the turbulent vertical velocity
dispersion and gas self-gravity are included. Mass-weighted pressures are an
order of magnitude higher than the midplane pressure because self-gravity
concentrates gas and increases the pressure in clouds. We also investigate the
ratio Rmol=M(H2)/M(HI) for our simulations. Blitz and Rosolowsky (2006) showed
that Rmol is proportional to the estimated midplane pressure. For model series
in which the epicyclic frequency, kappa, and gas surface density, Sigma, are
proportional, we recover the empirical relation. For other model series in
which kappa and Sigma are independent, the midplane pressure and Rmol are not
well correlated. We conclude that the molecular fraction -- and star formation
rate -- of a galactic disk inherently depends on its rotational state, not just
the local values of Sigma and the stellar density rho*. The empirical
correlation between Rmol and midplane pressure implies that the ""environmental
parameters"" kappa, Sigma, and rho* are interdependent in real galaxies,
presumably as a consequence of evolution toward states with Toomre Q near
unity. We note that Rmol in static models far exceeds both the values in our
turbulent simulations and observed values, implying that turbulence is crucial
to obtaining a realistic molecular fraction in the ISM.",Astronomy
556,557.0,"A full particle simulation study is carried out on the electron acceleration
at a collisionless, relatively low Alfven Mach number (M_A=5), perpendicular
shock. Recent self-consistent hybrid shock simulations have demonstrated that
the shock front of perpendicular shocks has a dynamic rippled character along
the shock surface of low-Mach-number perpendicular shocks. In this paper, the
effect of the rippling of perpendicular shocks on the electron acceleration is
examined by means of large-scale (ion-scale) two-dimensional full particle
simulations. It has been shown that a large-amplitude electric field is excited
at the shock front in association with the ion-scale rippling, and that
reflected ions are accelerated upstream at a localized region where the
shock-normal electric field of the rippled structure is polarized upstream. The
current-driven instability caused by the highly-accelerated reflected ions has
a high growth rate to large-amplitude electrostatic waves. Energetic electrons
are then generated by the large-amplitude electrostatic waves via electron
surfing acceleration at the leading edge of the shock transition region. The
present result suggests that the electron surfing acceleration is also a common
feature at low-Mach-number perpendicular collisionless shocks.",Astronomy
557,558.0,"Using numerical simulations of galactic disks resolving scales from ~1 to
several hundred pc, we investigate dynamical properties of the multiphase ISM
with turbulence driven by star formation feedback. We focus on HII region
effects by applying intense heating in dense, self-gravitating regions. Our
models are two-dimensional radial-vertical slices through the disk, and include
sheared background rotation, vertical stratification, heating and cooling to
yield temperatures T~10-10^4K, and thermal conduction. We separately vary the
gas surface density Sigma, the stellar volume density rho_*, and the local
angular rotation rate Omega to explore environmental dependencies, and analyze
the steady-state properties of each model. Among other statistics, we evaluate
turbulent amplitudes, virial ratios, Toomre Q parameters including turbulence,
and the mass fractions at different densities. We find that the dense gas
(n&gt;100 cm^-3) has turbulence levels similar to observed GMCs and virial ratios
~1-2. The Toomre Q parameter in dense gas reaches near unity, demonstrating
self-regulation via turbulent feedback. We also test how the star formation
rate Sigma_SFR depends on Sigma, rho_*, and Omega. Under the assumption that
the star formation rate is proportional to the mass at densities above n_th
divided by the free-fall time at that threshold, we find that Sigma_SFR varies
as Sigma^(1+p) with 1+p ~ 1.2-1.4 when n_th=10^2 or 10^3 cm^-3, consistent with
observations. Estimated star formation rates based on large-scale properties
(the orbital time, the Jeans time, or the free-fall time at the

neutrinos provided positive ions are accelerated by pulsar polar caps to PeV

environment as both charged and neutral pions are generated in the interactions
of energetic hadrons with the ambient photon fields. Here we estimate TeV gamma
ray flux at Earth from few nearby young pulsars. When compared with the

physical system is governed by the radiative, nonideal magnetohydrodynamic
(RMHD) equations. The magnetic flux is not assumed to be frozen in any of the
charged species. Its evolution is determined by a newly-derived generalized
Ohm's law, which accounts for the contributions of both elastic and inelastic

the eikonal limit, quasinormal modes of black holes in any dimensions are
determined by the parameters of the circular null geodesics. This result is
independent of the field equations and only assumes a stationary, spherically
symmetric and asymptotically flat line element, but it does not seem to be

567,568.0,"We present a novel numerical implementation of radiative transfer in the
cosmological smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulation code {\small
GADGET}. It is based on a fast, robust and photon-conserving integration scheme
where the radiation transport problem is approximated in terms of moments of
the transfer equation and by using a variable Eddington tensor as a closure
relation, following the `OTVET'-suggestion of Gnedin &amp; Abel. We derive a
suitable anisotropic diffusion operator for use in the SPH discretization of
the local photon transport, and we combine this with an implicit solver that
guarantees robustness and photon conservation. This entails a matrix inversion
problem of a huge, sparsely populated matrix that is distributed in memory in
our parallel code. We solve this task iteratively with a conjugate gradient
scheme. Finally, to model photon sink processes we consider ionisation and
recombination processes of hydrogen, which is represented with a chemical
network that is evolved with an implicit time integration scheme. We present
several tests of our implementation, including single and multiple sources in
static uniform density fields with and without temperature evolution, shadowing
by a dense clump, and multiple sources in a static cosmological density field.
All tests agree quite well with analytical computations or with predictions
from other radiative transfer codes, except for shadowing. However, unlike most
other radiative transfer codes presently in use for studying reionisation, our
new method can be used on-the-fly during dynamical cosmological simulation,
allowing simultaneous treatments of galaxy formation and the reionisation
process of the Universe.",Astronomy
568,569.0,"We investigate the origin of a flux increase found during a transit of
TrES-1, observed with the HST. This feature in the HST light curve cannot be
attributed to noise and is supposedly a dark area on the stellar surface of the
host star eclipsed by TrES-1 during its transit. We investigate the likeliness
of two possible hypothesis for its origin: A starspot or a second transiting
planet. We made use of several transit observations of TrES-1 from space with
the HST and from ground with the IAC-80 telescope. On the basis of these
observations we did a statistical study of flux variations in each of the
observed events, to investigate if similar flux increases are present in other
parts of the data set. The HST observation presents a single clear flux rise
during a transit whereas the ground observations led to the detection of two
such events but with low significance. In the case of having observed a
starspot in the HST data, assuming a central impact between the spot and
TrES-1, we would obtain a lower limit for the spot radius of 42000 km. For this
radius the spot temperature would be 4690 K, 560 K lower then the stellar
surface of 5250 K. For a putative second transiting planet we can set a lower
limit for its radius at 0.37 R$_J$ and for periods of less than 10.5 days, we
can set an upper limit at 0.72 R$_J$. Assuming a conventional interpretation,
then this HST observation constitutes the detection of a starspot.
Alternatively, this flux rise might also be caused by an additional transiting
planet. The true nature of the origin can be revealed if a wavelength
dependency of the flux rise can be shown or discarded with a higher certainty.
Additionally, the presence of a second planet can also be detected by radial
velocity measurements.",Astronomy
569,570.0,"It is now well accepted that the galaxies are distributed in filaments,
sheets and clusters all of which form an interconnected network known as the
Cosmic Web. It is a big challenge to quantify the shapes of the interconnected
structural elements that form this network. Tools like the Minkowski
functionals which use global properties, though well suited for an isolated
object like a single sheet or filament, are not suited for an interconnected
network of such objects. We consider the Local Dimension $D$, defined through
$N(R)=A R^D$, where $N(R)$ is the galaxy number count within a sphere of
comoving radius $R$ centered on a particular galaxy, as a tool to locally
quantify the shape in the neigbourhood of different galaxies along the Cosmic
Web. We expect $D \sim 1,2$ and 3 for a galaxy located in a filament, sheet and
cluster respectively. Using LCDM N-body simulations we find that it is possible
to determine $D$ through a power law fit to $N(R)$ across the length-scales 2
to $10 {\rm Mpc}$ for $\sim 33 %$ of the galaxies. We have visually identified
the filaments and sheets corresponding to many of the galaxies with $D \sim 1$
and 2 respectively. In several other situations the structure responsible for
the $D$ value could not be visually identified, either due to its being tenuous
or due to other dominating structures in the vicinity. We also show that the
global distribution of the $D$ values can be used to visualize and interpret
how the different structural elements are woven into the Cosmic Web.",Astronomy

detection/null-detection of tensors and non-Gaussianities. We perform Markov
Chain Monte Carlo and flow analyses on a simulated Planck-precision data set to
obtain constraints. We find that a failure to detect non-Gaussianities
precludes a successful inversion of the primordial power spectrum, greatly
affecting uncertainties, even in the presence of a tensor detection. In the
absence of a tensor detection, while unable to determine the energy scale of

be the highest yet seen. The near-infrared K-band imaging shows an adjacent
compact HII region and IR cluster surrounded by a shell-like photodissociation
region showing H2 emission. At the molecular infall peak, the K imaging also

introducing an electromagnetic field. We then consider the intrinsic statistics
of the magnetic stresses in two ways, analytically and via static realisations.
We construct the power spectra, some of which we present for the first time. At
the one- and three-point level we find significant intrinsic non-Gaussianities.
Finally we turn to the observable impacts a primordial magnetic field. Assuming
coherence, the statistics of the source can be mapped onto the CMB in a simple

574,575.0,"We completed a search for circumstellar disks around Herbig Be stars using
the NRAO Very Large Array (VLA) and the IRAM Plateau de Bure (PdB)

297, Z CMa, and LKHa 215. We constructed the SED from near-IR to centimeter
wavelengths by adding our millimeter and centimeter data to the available data
at other wavelengths, mainly Spitzer images. The entire SED was fitted using a
disk+envelope model. In addition, we compiled all the disk millimeter
observations in the literature and completed a statistical analysis of all the
data. We show that the disk mass is usually only a small percentage (less than
10%) of the mass of the entire envelope in HBe stars. For the disks, there are
large source-to-source variations. Two disks in our sample, R Mon and Z CMa,
have similar sizes and masses to those found in T Tauri and Herbig Ae stars.
The disks around MWC 1080 and MWC 297 are, however, smaller (rout&lt;100 AU). We
did not detect the disks towards MWC 137 and LkHa 215 at millimeter
wavelengths, which limits the mass and the size of the possible circumstellar

Herbig Ae stars indicates that although massive disks (0.1 Msun) are found in
young objects (10^4 yr), the masses of the disks around Herbig Be stars are
usually 5-10 times lower than those around lower mass stars. We propose that
disk photoevaporation is responsible for this behavior. In Herbig Be stars, the
UV radiation disperses the gas in the outer disk on a timescale of a few 10^5

576,577.0,"We present a new method based on the N-point probability distribution (pdf)
to study non-Gaussianity in cosmic microwave background (CMB) maps. Likelihood
and Bayesian estimation are applied to a local non-linear perturbed model up to
third order, characterized by a linear term which is described by a Gaussian
N-pdf, and a second and third order terms which are proportional to the square
and the cube of the linear one. We also explore a set of model selection
techniques (the Akaike and the Bayesian Information Criteria, the minimum
description length, the Bayesian Evidence and the Generalized Likelihood Ratio
Test) and their application to decide whether a given data set is better
described by the proposed local non-Gaussian model, rather than by the standard
Gaussian temperature distribution. As an application, we consider the analysis
of the WMAP 5-year data at a resolution of around 2 degrees. At this angular
scale (the Sachs-Wolfe regime), the non-Gaussian description proposed in this
work defaults (under certain conditions) to an approximative local form of the
weak non-linear coupling inflationary model (e.g. Komatsu &amp; Spergel 2001)
previously addressed in the literature. For this particular case, we obtain an
estimation for the non-linear coupling parameter of -94 &lt; F_nl &lt; 154 at 95% CL.
Equally, model selection criteria also indicate that the Gaussian hypothesis is
favored against the particular local non-Gaussian model proposed in this work.
This result is in agreement with previous findings obtained for equivalent
non-Gaussian models and with different non-Gaussian estimators. However, our
estimator based on the N-pdf is more efficient than previous estimators and,
therefore, provides tighter constraints on the coupling parameter at degree
angular resolution.",Astronomy
577,578.0,"In this work, considering the impact of a SNR with a neutral magnetized cloud
we derived analytically a set of conditions which are favorable for driving
gravitational instability in the cloud and thus star formation. We have built
diagrams of the SNR radius, versus the cloud density, that constrain a domain
in the parameter space where star formation is allowed. The diagrams are also
tested with fully 3-D MHD simulations involving a SNR and a self-gravitating
cloud and we find that the numerical analysis is consistent with the results
predicted by the diagrams. While the inclusion of a homogeneous magnetic field
approximately perpendicular to the impact velocity of the SNR with an intensity
~1 $ mu$G results only a small shrinking of the star formation triggering zone
in the diagrams, a larger magnetic field (~10 $ mu$G) causes a significant
shrinking, as expected. Applications of the diagrams to a few regions of our
own galaxy have revealed that star formation in those sites could have been
triggered by shock waves from SNRs. Finally, we have evaluated the effective
star formation efficiency for this sort of interaction and found that it is
smaller than the observed values in our own Galaxy (sfe ~0.01-0.3). This result
is consistent with previous work in the literature and also suggests that the
mechanism presently investigated, though very powerful to drive structure
formation, supersonic turbulence and eventually, local star formation, does not
seem to be sufficient to drive global star formation in normal star forming
galaxies, not even when the magnetic field in the neutral clouds is neglected.

578,579.0,"(Abridged) The thermal state of the intracluster medium results from a
competition between gas cooling and heating. The heating comes from two
distinct sources: gravitational heating from the collapse of the dark matter
halo and thermal input from galaxy/black hole formation. However, a long
standing problem has been that cosmological simulations based on smoothed
particle hydrodynamics (SPH) and Eulerian mesh codes predict different results
even when cooling and galaxy/black hole heating are switched off. Clusters
formed in SPH simulations show near powerlaw entropy profiles, while those
formed in mesh simulations develop a core and do not allow gas to reach such
low entropies. Since the cooling rate is closely connected to the minimum
entropy of the gas, the differences are of potentially key importance.
  In this paper, we investigate the origin of this discrepancy. By comparing
simulations run using the GADGET-2 SPH code and the FLASH adaptive Eulerian
mesh code, we show that the discrepancy arises during the idealised merger of
two clusters. The difference is not sensitive to the resolution of our
simulations, nor is it is due differences in the gravity solvers, Galilean
non-invariance of the mesh code, or an effect of unsuitable artificial
viscosity in the SPH code. Instead, we find that the difference is inherent to
the treatment of eddies and fluid instabilities. These are suppressed in the
SPH simulations, while the cluster mergers generate strong vortices in the mesh
simulations that efficiently mix the fluid and erase the low entropy gas.
Consequently, particles in the SPH simulations retain a close connection to
their initial entropy, while this connection is much weaker in the mesh
simulations. We discuss the potentially profound implications of these results.",Astronomy

simple models have only one free parameter: the dynamical mass-to-light ratio,
which we assume is independent of radius. Given the simplicity of the modelling
procedure, the model second velocity moments are strikingly good fits to the
observed stellar kinematics within the extent of our kinematic data, which
typically reach ~ 0.5-1 R25 (where R25 is the optical radius), or equivalently
2-3 Re (where Re is the effective or half-light radius). We therefore find no
evidence for a dominant dark matter component within the optical disk of spiral
galaxies. This is equally true of the S0s in our sample, which significantly
extends previous observational constraints on dark matter in these galaxies.

surface density both within and between galaxies. NGC 4254 appears to have a
larger star formation efficiency(smaller gas depletion time), perhaps because
it is on its first passage through the Virgo Cluster. NGC 4569 shows a
large-scale gradient in the gas properties traced by the CO J=3-2/J=1-0 line
ratio, which suggests that its interaction with the intracluster medium is
affecting the dense star-forming portion of the interstellar medium directly.

extracting CO from the grains when the visual extinction remains below about 5

inconsistency could be the result of grain growth. On the other hand, the

these properties have been compared between sub-samples associated with
different indicators of evolution. The greatest differences are found between
clumps associated with 8.6 GHz radio emission, indicating the presence of an

Ultra-Compact HII (UCHII) regions and in sources with detected CH3CN, and may
constitute a crude molecular clock in single dish observations. Clumps
associated with 8.6 GHz radio emission tend to be more massive and more

algorithms, demonstrated the best performance during the first detection blind
test organized inside the CoRoT consortium. The third method, the 3-spot model,
is a simplified physical model of Sun-like variability and the fourth is a

large number of 150-day light curves (as for CoRoT long runs) for different
planetary radii, orbital periods, epochs of the first transit and standard
deviations of the photon shot noise. Stellar variability is given by the Total
Solar Irradiance variations as observed close to the maximum of solar cycle 23.
After filtering solar variability, transits are searched for by means of the

to filter light curves of solar-like stars when a suitable window can be
chosen. As the performance of this filter depends critically on the length of
its window, we point out that the window must be as long as possible, according
to the magnetic activity level of the star. We show an automatic method to
choose the extension of the filter window from the power spectrum of the light
curves. The iterative non-linear filter, when used with a suitable choice of
its window, has a better performance than more complicated and computationally

be negative (i.e., in the sense of counter-rotation with the Sun). However, the
opposite holds for the slow wind, and the overall particle contribution $L_P =
L_p + L_\alpha$ tends to exceed the magnetic one $L_M$. These aspects are at
variance with previous models. We examine whether introducing realistic ion
temperature anisotropies can resolve this discrepancy. From the general
multifluid transport equations with gyrotropic species pressure tensors, we
derive the equations governing both the meridional and azimuthal dynamics of
general axisymmetrical, rotating stellar winds that include two major ion
species. The azimuthal dynamics are examined in detail, using the empirically
constructed meridional flow profiles for the solar wind. We find that $L$ is
determined by requiring that the solution to the total angular momentum
conservation law is unique and smooth close to the Alfven point, where the
combined Alfvenic Mach number $M_T=1$. Introducing realistic ion temperature
anisotropies may introduce a change of up to 10% in $L$ and up to 1.8 km/s in
azimuthal speeds of individual ions between 0.3 and 1 AU, compared with the
isotropic case. The latter has strong consequences on the relative importance
of $L_P$ and $L_M$. However, introducing ion temperature anisotropies cannot
resolve the discrepancy between measurements and models. For the fast-wind
solutions, while in extreme cases $L_P$ becomes negative, $L_p$ never does. On
the other hand, for the slow-wind solutions, $L_P$ never exceeds $L_M$, even
though $L_M$ may be less than the individual ion contribution, since $L_p$ and
$L_\alpha$ always have opposite signs for the slow and fast wind alike.",Astronomy

593,594.0,"We have observed with XMM-Newton four radiatively efficient active type 1
galaxies with black hole masses &lt; 10^6 Msun, selected optically from the SDSS.
We show here that their soft X-ray spectrum exhibits a soft excess with the
same characteristics as that observed ubiquitously in radio-quiet Seyfert 1
galaxies and type 1 quasars, both in terms of temperatures and strength.
However, even when the soft X-ray excess is modelled with a pure thermal disc,
its luminosity turns out to be much lower than that expected from accretion
theory for the given temperature, casting further doubts on a thermal
interpretation for soft excesses. While alternative scenarios for the nature of
the soft excess (namely smeared ionized absorption and disc reflection) cannot
be distinguished on a pure statistical basis, we point out that the absorption
model produces a strong correlation between absorbing column density and
ionization state, which may be difficult to interpret and is most likely
spurious. As for reflection, it does only invoke standard ingredients of any
accretion model for radiatively efficient sources such as a hard X-rays source
and a relatively cold (though partially ionized) accretion disc, and therefore
seems the natural choice to explain the soft excess in most (if not all) cases.
The reflection model is also consistent with the additional presence of a
thermal disc component with the theoretically expected temperature (although,
again, with smaller-than-expected total luminosity). The observed active
galaxies are among the most variable in X-rays and their excess variance is
among the largest. This is in line with their relatively small black hole mass
and with expectations from simple power spectra models. (abridged)",Astronomy

electrons of the first beam and the protons of the second beam. The wave traps
the electrons, which form plasmons. The plasmons couple energy into the ion
acoustic waves, which trap the protons of the second beam. A proton phase space
hole grows, which develops through its interaction with the oxygen and the
heated electrons into a rarefaction pulse. This pulse drives a strong ion
acoustic double layer, which accelerates a beam of electrons to about 50 MeV,
which is comparable to the proton kinetic energy. The proton distribution

very high energy (VHE, E &gt; 100 GeV) band to investigate VHE cosmic rays (CRs)
in this class of objects which are the largest gravitationally bound systems in
the Universe. Methods: H.E.S.S., an array of four Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov
Telescopes (IACT), is used to observe the targets in the range of VHE gamma
rays. Results: No significant gamma-ray signal is found at the respective
position of the two clusters with several different source size assumptions for
each target. In particular, emission regions corresponding to the high density
core, to the extension of the entire X-ray emission in these clusters, and to
the very extended region where the accretion shock is expected, are
investigated. Upper limits are derived for the gamma-ray flux at energies E&gt;570
GeV for Abell 496 and E&gt;460 GeV for Abell 85. Conclusions: From the
non-detection in VHE gamma rays, upper limits on the total energy of hadronic
CRs in the clusters are calculated. If the cosmic-ray energy density follows
the large scale gas density profile, the limit on the fraction of energy in
these non-thermal particles with respect to the total thermal energy of the
intra-cluster medium (ICM) is 51% for Abell 496 and only 8% for Abell 85 due to
its larger mass and higher gas density. These upper limits are compared with
theoretical estimates. They predict about ~10% of the thermal energy of the ICM

peak in the temperature distribution at 14,000K. The luminosity of the gas in
this peak is correlated with the energy. We interpret this as a realisation of
the shock ionisation scenario. The interplay between shock heating and
radiative cooling establishes the equilibrium temperature. This is close to the
observed emission in some Narrow Line Regions. We also confirm the shift of the

near disk center. We select THMFs that have net linear polarization (LP) higher
than 0.22%, and an area larger than or equal to 3 pixels, and compare their
occurrence rates and distribution of magnetic field azimuth. We obtain
probability density functions (PDFs) of magnetic field strength and inclination

quiet Sun. The vertical magnetic flux in the plage region is ~8 times larger
than in the quiet Sun. There is essentially no preferred orientation for the
THMFs in either region. However, THMFs in the plage region with higher LP have
a preferred direction consistent with that of the plage-region's large-scale
vertical field pattern. PDFs show that there is no difference in the
distribution of field strength of horizontal fields between the quiet Sun and
the plage regions when we avoid the persistent large vertical flux
concentrations for the plage region. The similarity of the PDFs and of the
occurrence rates in plage and quiet regions suggests that a local dynamo
process due to the granular motion may generate THMFs all over the sun. The
preferred orientation for higher LP in the plage indicates that the THMFs are
somewhat influenced by the larger-scale magnetic field pattern of the plage.",Astronomy

602,,"Semantic representations arise from a distillation of multiple sources of information, including sensory, motor, affective, interoceptive, linguistic and cognitive experience. Experience of reward is a highly salient aspect of many human activities, and yet its contribution to semantic processing is not well understood. To address this, the present study took a psycholinguistic approach to measuring and evaluating associations with reward as a facet of word meaning. Behavioral and neurophysiological data suggest reward processing involves multiple stages and mechanisms. For instance, systems associated with the experience and anticipation of pleasure in response to a reward appear distinct from motivational processes that underlie pursuit of a stimulus. We sought to collect a novel set of word ratings that capture the full extent of reward-related experience. Initial explorations revealed that reward/pleasure ratings are highly correlated with existing norms of emotional valence. Ratings of association with motivation, however, were only moderately correlated with valence, suggesting they capture distinct semantic information. We therefore conducted a preregistered large-scale study to obtain motivation ratings for 8601 words. Our analyses suggest these ratings capture aspects of word meaning which are distinct from other semantic dimensions, such as concreteness and valence. Moreover, they explain unique variance in participant performance on lexical, semantic, and recognition memory tasks. We combined motivation and emotional valence ratings to provide a composite measure that might approximate a more general ‘reward’ construct. However, this was worse at explaining task performance than the individual variables. We discuss implications of these results for neurocognitive theories of semantics.",Psychology

Exploring creativity through the use of electroencephalography (EEG) provides valuable insights into the brain mechanisms underlying this vital cognitive process.

This study analyzed the power spectrum characteristics and functional connectivity of interhemispheric and intrahemispheric brain activity during creative tasks in 15 Argentine children aged 9 to 12, using a 14-channel EEG system. The Torrance test of creative thinking (TTCT) was used, incorporating one figural and one verbal task. EEG metrics included relative power spectral density (rPSD) across Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, and Gamma bands, as well as functional connectivity assessed through coherence analysis across the [1–50] Hz spectrum.

The results revealed significant increases in rPSD across all frequency bands during creative tasks compared to rest, with no significant differences between figural and verbal tasks. Coherence analysis indicated enhanced intrahemispheric synchronization, particularly in frontotemporal and temporo-occipital regions, alongside reduced interhemispheric frontal coherence. These findings suggest that creativity in children involves a dynamic reorganization of brain activity, characterized by oscillatory activation and region-specific connectivity changes. Furthermore, the study highlights a common neural basis for divergent thinking tasks, contributing to a deeper understanding of the brain mechanisms supporting creativity during childhood development.",Psychology
604,,"Humans tune in to the native language prosody before they are even born. Prior findings with newborns reported language-specific processing of forward versus backward speech and intonational contours and also indicated language-specific processing of iambic versus trochaic patterns in non-linguistic tone stimuli. The present experiment tested newborns’ processing of temporal rhythm patterns in naturalistic native-language speech. Czech-learning newborns were played naturally recorded well-formed Czech utterances with native Czech rhythm (virtually lacking cues to word-level stress) and with non-native rhythm (prolonged foot-initial syllables), while their hemodynamic activity was recorded. The results showed larger hemodynamic responses to the non-native than to the native rhythm in a late analysis window, attributable to a double-peak response shape in the non-native condition. This finding is discussed in terms of suprisal-induced resonating activity after hearing familiar native speech paired with an unfamiliar rhythm pattern. Further, there was an overall attenuated response to the native rhythm localized in the right frontal region (comprising the Broca's area), evidencing right-lateralized processing of speech rhythm. Traditional language development theories claimed that only coarse between-class rhythm differences between languages are processed at birth. Having demonstrated that newborns differentially process non-native vs. native rhythmic patterns within natural native-langugae speech, even in a language outside of the traditional rhythm classes, the present findings disprove some of the early theories and substantially deepen our understanding of early speech development.",Psychology

By analyzing stream-of-consciousness essays from 2,240 undergraduates using BERT with integrated gradients attribution, we identify distinct linguistic markers that characterize sex-specific trait expression. Our approach illustrates how explainability methods can help to detect systematic variations in language patterns across different trait levels and between males and females. Logistic regression analyses reveal Neuroticism as the strongest predictor of language typical of each sex (OR = 2.11, p ≤ .001), followed by Extraversion and Agreeableness. The model achieves 82.8\% accuracy in sex classification, and the explainability technique shows that sex differences in language often diminish at extreme trait levels. The study's methodological contribution lies in demonstrating how explainable AI can advance personality assessment by providing interpretable insights into the complex interaction between sex and personality in natural language use. The study also illustrates how explainable AI can advance personality assessment beyond descriptive statistics to provide interpretable insights into complex psychological phenomena, demonstrating a framework for deeper exploration of personality psychology findings.",Psychology

Transforming scientific research stages into activities that can engage co-researchers (including conducting analysis, critical thinking, and producing overarching themes) underscored an equitable partnership.

613,,"People tend to show greater liking for expressions of sadness when these expressions are described as art. Why does this effect arise? One obvious hypothesis would be that describing something as art makes people more likely to regard it as fictional, and people prefer expressions of sadness that are not real. We contrast this obvious hypothesis with a hypothesis derived from the philosophical literature. On this alternative hypothesis, describing something as art makes people more inclined to appropriate it, i.e., to see it as an expression of their own sadness. Study 1 found that describing the exact same sad text as art (e.g., a monologue) as opposed to not-art (e.g., a diary entry) led to increased liking for the work. Study 2 showed that this effect is not mediated by fictionality. Study 3 showed that the effect is mediated by appropriation. Study 4 looked at the impact of a manipulation of fictionality. Describing a work as fictional did lead to increased liking, but this effect was completely mediated by appropriation.

This effect was replicated across two experiments, and was correlated with retrieval performance. Interestingly, this categorical partitioning, which differentiated the content of the retrieved information, was paired with a temporal partitioning, which reflected the temporal progression of the retrieval experience.

616,,"The shift from handwriting to digital typing as the dominant form of written communication has led to a decrease in handwriting proficiency. This trend is particularly evident in opaque writing systems, such as Chinese, where speakers increasingly experience “character amnesia”, the inability to (fully) handwrite a character despite being able to recognise it. In this study, we investigated whether prior exposure to a phonetic or semantic radical of a character helps to subsequently alleviate amnesia in handwriting the character. In three online experiments, participants were first exposed to a prime character that shares a phonetic radical, a semantic radical, or no radical with a target character (or, in Experiment 2, exposed to a stand-alone radical); then they handwrote the target character according to a dictation prompt. Participants reported less character amnesia in handwriting the target character if they had previously been exposed to a phonetic or semantic radical, either as part of a prime character or as a stand-alone radical. Furthermore, the priming effect of the semantic radical was similar regardless of whether the prime had a semantic radical with high or low semantic transparency. These findings suggest that character amnesia in Chinese is caused by the incomplete orthographic activation in semantic and phonetic radicals.",Psychology

The current study employed functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to explore brain regions that are associated with character amnesia; in particular, we tested whether character amnesia is associated with deactivation in the fusiform gyrus (FG), the superior parietal gyrus (SPG), or the supramarginal gyrus (SMG), which have been shown to respectively associated with the orthographic lexicon, graphemic buffer, and phonology-orthography conversion. In a handwriting-to-dictation task, twenty-three Cantonese-speaking adults handwrote a character according to a dictation prompt and then reported whether they correctly handwrote the character or suffered from character amnesia. fNIRS results showed that, compared to correct handwriting, character amnesia elicited significantly reduced neural activation in the bilateral FG, the SPG, and the SMG. Parametric analyses showed that character frequency and number of strokes positively correlated with activation of the FG and the SPG respectively. Functional connectivity analyses further demonstrated that, compared to correct handwriting, character amnesia was associated with significantly decreased connectivity between the left FG and the left SMG, the right FG and the right SMG, the right FG and the right SPG, the right FG and the left SMG, the right FG and the left SPG, but with increased connectivity between the left SPG and the left SMG.

621,,"According to counterfactual theories of causal judgment, people judge causation by evaluating the consequences of counterfactual interventions on their representations of the world. What is the format of these representations? Research on causal generalization suggests that people hold `invariant' representations of causal relationships that can be flexibly composed together. We suggest that people can compute counterfactuals on the basis of these invariant representations, and in particular they can imagine `disconnecting' the causal link between two variables. Importantly, this hypothesis implies that causal judgment is supported by richer representations than the Structural Causal Models (SCMs) used in most counterfactual theories. We argue that this gap can explain the shortcomings of existing counterfactual theories, for example why these theories struggle to explain the distinction between `productive’ and non-productive causation. In a series of simple experiments, we find that the consequences of variable-disconnection counterfactuals systematically affect people’s causal judgments, even holding constant the structural causal model describing the situation. Overall, the counterfactual framework might provide a unifying account of human causal judgment, provided we correctly understand the mental representations people use to imagine counterfactual scenarios.",Psychology

temporary physics characterizes all complex dynamical systems that persist through
time as Bayesian agents. If all persistent systems are to some – perhaps only minimal
– extent cognitive, are all persistent systems to some extent alive, or are living sys-
tems only a subset of cognitive systems? We argue that no bright line can be drawn,
and we re-assess, from this perspective, the Fermi paradox and the Drake equation.
We conclude that improving our abilities to recognize and communicate with diverse
intelligences in diverse embodiments, whether based on familiar biochemistry or not,
will either resolve or obviate the OOL problem.",Psychology
623,,"Social exclusion is a negative experience in social interaction which can be modulated by the perceived eye gaze. In our Cyberball study, we asked how gaze direction – direct versus averted – affects the processing of social exclusion by using electroencephalogram (EEG) methods. Participants encountered neutral gazes in the inclusion phase (Block1) and then either direct or averted gazes during the exclusion phase (Block2). We measured self-reports on Need-Threat Questionnaires (belonging, control, meaningful existence, self-esteem) and negative mood, along with event-related potentials (ERPs), specifically the P3 component (P300) - an indicator of expectation violation. Findings demonstrated that the P3 amplitude showed differential changes between gaze conditions during the transition from inclusion to exclusion, with direct gaze eliciting stronger neural responses. This difference signals that direct gaze enhances the expected participation, thus sensitizing participants for exclusionary signals. Simultaneously, self-reports indicated that the transition evoked weaker negative emotions in the direct gaze group and stronger negative emotions in the averted gaze group, signalling that direct gaze also serves as an affiliative signal. These results illuminate how gaze directions shape cognitive and emotional reactions to social exclusion. However, further research is necessary to unravel these effects amidst other non-verbal cues and fully comprehend their impact on neural and behavioural responses to social exclusion.",Psychology
624,,"Ambulatory assessment has gained widespread popularity among researchers who study the dynamics of everyday experiences and behaviors, such as sleep patterns or emotional states. In this paper, we focus on the challenge that arises when we want to investigate the dynamic relations between variables that were measured at different frequencies. As a running example, we use a sleep quality variable measured once every morning and a mood variable measured multiple times during the day for multiple days. We propose two N=1 models that imply different processes; the first focuses on dynamic relations from day to day between sleep quality and a daily factor of the mood variable, and the second focuses on dynamic relations from one measurement occasion to the next, which prioritizes when the variables affect each other. Additionally, we introduce a combination of these two models and demonstrate their accuracy with a simulation study. An empirical N=1 example of daily sleep quality and momentary self-doubt demonstrates that dynamic relations exist between sleep quality and self-doubt at certain moments in the day and the daily factor of self-doubt. Researchers may adjust the proposed dynamic models to align with their own theories and to accommodate different data or research interests.",Psychology
625,,"Automatic evaluation has emerged as a central concept in contemporary thinking about prejudice. The 
present research tested the quintessential aspect of prejudice: Does group affiliation dominate 
automatic evaluation of individual group members even when diagnostic evaluative information about 
the individuals is available? Participants read about the behaviors of two individuals: one from a 
typically liked group and one from a typically disliked group, portraying one individual as more 
positive than the other, and manipulating the extremity and direction of that difference. We conducted 
six studies (Total N = 11,572, with samples consisting of adults residing in the U.S.), across different 
group types (age, gender, or race), and indirect measures that purportedly measure automatic evaluation 
(the Implicit Association Test [IAT] and the Evaluative Priming Task [EPT]). Group affiliation 
(relatively to personal characteristics) influenced the IAT and the EPT more than it influenced the self-
reported evaluation. These results may suggest that automatic evaluation of individuals is more 
prejudiced than nonautomatic evaluation.",Psychology
626,,"Esports is a rapidly growing global industry with millions of participants, yet there are no standardised mental health frameworks to support players, coaches, and organisations. This study aimed to identify key priorities for developing international mental health guidelines tailored to esports, defining their scope and outlining the roles of key stakeholders. Using a modified Delphi approach, an expert panel of 18 professionals specialising in esports and mental health participated in a two-round consensus process. In Round One, qualitative responses identified five key areas of focus, leading to the development of 13 statements on mental health promotion, prevention, and care. In Round Two, panel members rated their agreement and the perceived importance of these statements using a 4-point Likert scale, with statements reaching 80% consensus included in the final recommendations. Of the 13 statements, 12 achieved consensus, emphasising the need for mental health literacy programs, safe and healthy environments, and structured mental health first aid training for coaches and community leaders. The expert panel also highlighted the responsibility of game publishers, tournament organisers, and governing bodies in promoting mental health resources and policies. This study provides a foundation for evidence-based esports mental health guidelines, which can inform future policy development, industry practices, and player support systems.",Psychology
627,,"While prevailing theories suggest social interaction difficulties are inherent to individuals with autism, the theory of the double empathy problem (Milton, 2012) proposes that these difficulties result from a mismatch between neurologically different interaction partners. This theory also predicts less difficulty during interaction between individuals with autism. Existing studies are limited, warranting further investigation. In 2022, adults with autism completed an online mixed-method questionnaire, which included demographic questions, a question regarding language preference, 14 statements (N = 407) comparing various aspects of interaction between individuals with and without autism and six open-ended questions (N = 337). The sample includes adults spanning a range of ages and educational backgrounds. The results from the statements revealed that adults with autism experienced all, except for one, aspects of communication to be better and easier with others who also have autism than with others who do not. The only aspect of communication they did not experience to be better with others with autism was body language. The results from the open-ended questions mainly support the findings from the statements, but also provide additional nuance. Themes highlighted easier interactions between individuals with autism, characterized by mutual understanding and the absence of judgment. Additionally, when they know someone else also has autism, they feel less need to camouflage. However, some interaction difficulties were also noted. In conclusion, the experiences of adults with autism in our study align with the theory of the double empathy problem, however further systematic research is warranted to test this theory.",Psychology
628,,"Purpose. Many women want to breastfeed, but experience breastfeeding difficulties (such as latching problems, perceived low milk supply, nipple pain) with associated consequences for poor mental health. The aim of the current study was to investigate mother’s perceptions of how breastfeeding difficulties have impacted their mental health, couched within a behaviour change model, to identify intervention targets.
Methods. Data were collected in October 2023 via an online cross-sectional survey. Participants provided qualitative open-ended responses to describe how they felt that breastfeeding difficulties may have impacted their mental health (N=1141).  This qualitative data was analysed using thematic analysis and themes were mapped deductively on to the COM-B model of behaviour change.
Results. In general, mothers were highly motivated to breastfeed, but experienced challenges with psychological capability, physical capability, and social opportunity. Analyses resulted in the identification of the following targets for intervention: 1) education around the realities of what to expect when breastfeeding, including breastfeeding difficulties, 2) support for technical challenges and pain management when experiencing breastfeeding difficulties, and 3) education for healthcare professionals, families and wider society on the importance of supporting breastfeeding mothers who are experiencing breastfeeding difficulties.
Conclusion. Interventions targeted at breastfeeding mothers who are experiencing breastfeeding difficulties with associated mental health consequences have the potential to reduce rates of both early breastfeeding cessation and poor maternal mental health in the postnatal period. Here, we extend existing knowledge by identifying potential intervention targets to enable mothers to better cope with the challenges of breastfeeding.",Psychology
629,,"Positive feedback is often given in an attempt to boost people’s performance. In many cases, however, positive feedback undermines performance. Why? A common explanation is recipients interpret positive feedback as evidence that they are making more progress toward their goal than expected, leading them to coast. Here, we propose an alternative explanation: Receiving positive feedback is a pleasurable experience that decouples the grip of attention from the task, which undermines performance. If so, performance drops after positive feedback could be prevented by delaying the positive feedback until individuals have started preparing for their next task. Doing so may even transform the positive feedback into a motivational reward that allows individuals to utilize the rewarding experience of receiving positive feedback to energize their on-task behavior, thereby improving performance. We tested the decoupling hypothesis in three well-powered experiments (total N = 395), including a preregistered replication. Across experiments, we found that when positive feedback was delivered before participants started preparing for their next task, it impaired subsequent performance. Supporting the decoupling hypothesis, when positive feedback was delivered after participants started preparing for their next task, it did not impair subsequent performance; in fact, it boosted performance. These findings shed new light on the cognitive-affective mechanisms that underlie performance drops after positive feedback and identify unique ways to alleviate them. Also, the findings show that individuals do not invariably coast after positive feedback. This has broad implications for motivation theory and feedback interventions.",Psychology
630,,"Facial features transmit emotions but their effect on visual orienting and explicit emotion recognition is debated. Here we examined whether fixating on diagnostic features of emotional expressions — such as eye region for fear and the mouth for happiness — affects saccadic targeting and improves recognition accuracy. Across two pre-registered experiments, participants viewed fearful, happy, and neutral faces for short intervals (50ms or 150ms) while the initial fixation location was manipulated. Although such brief stimulation does not allow for visual exploration, the faces triggered a substantial number of saccades that occurred after stimulus offset. These reflexive saccades were modulated by the emotional expressions indicating a consistent preferential saccadic orienting towards diagnostic features, even with limited exposure. As this effect disappeared for inverted faces, it can be attributed to an extrafoveal processing of facial features instead of an attentional orienting towards physically salient image regions. Participants' recognition accuracy was unaffected by the foveated facial feature, but this observation might also be due to ceiling effects in performance. Collectively, these findings contribute to understanding the attentional mechanisms of feature-based processing in the perception of emotional facial expressions.",Psychology
631,,"People rapidly and robustly make social inferences based on descriptions of others’ behavior. Consequently, written behavioral stimuli are frequently deployed in psychological research in domains such as social cognition, impression formation, and moral psychology. That said, existing behavioral stimulus sets are somewhat limited in size and scope, and moreover, tend to lack characterization. We collected behaviors from several widely used sets, and then expanded on them by writing hundreds of new behaviors. Ultimately, this yielded a database of 2375 behaviors that is larger, broader in scope, and considerably more diverse than the previous sets that inspired this work. We then recruited a large set of participants (total N = 4792) to evaluate these behaviors across 18 dimensions central to person perception. It is our hope that this resource can support more rigorous, replicable research into the psychological and neural underpinnings of social learning.",Psychology
632,,"Consumers often feel disgusted toward products that have been touched by others, a phenomenon known as the negative contagion effect (NCE). While prior research has explored NCE through biological and cultural lenses, the role of interpersonal factors remains underexamined. This study investigates how the toucher’s gender and social role influence NCE and psychological ownership. Study 1 revealed that male touchers elicited stronger NCE compared to female touchers, and products touched by stranger customers were more negatively perceived than those touched by store staff. Study 2 demonstrated that psychological ownership was higher for products touched by stranger customers than by store staff, suggesting a close relationship between ownership perceptions and NCE. These findings highlight the interplay of social and psychological factors in shaping consumer disgust. Practical implications include strategies for optimizing product handling in retail and online contexts. Future research should explore cultural and product-specific variations to further refine our understanding of NCE dynamics.",Psychology

634,,"A metastudy is a set of many tiny studies (microstudies) created from a much larger collection of possibilities. Metastudies can yield many of the benefits of time-consuming replications and meta-analyses, but more efficiently and with greater attention to generalizability and the causal effects of moderators. Statistical precision and power are higher than in studies with the same total sample size but with fewer conditions and more participants per condition. In this article, we describe metastudies and their benefits, demonstrate how to conduct a metastudy using the well-known risky-choice framing effect as an example, and report on the generalizability of that effect. In three metastudies (total N = 2338), the framing effect generalized well across most of the potential moderators tested, as was expected. Surprisingly, however, the effect was up to twice as large when the certain option was replaced with a slightly risky option; prospect theory predicts the opposite and fuzzy-trace theory predicts no difference. Metastudies provide a relatively quick and not-so-painful way to examine an effect’s generalizability, without waiting for a meta-analysis. Both individual labs and multi-lab networks are encouraged to shift from traditional studies to metastudies.",Psychology
635,,"Clinical trials, laboratory experiments, and neuroimaging studies provide converging evidence that pain is highly sensitive to expectations, whether based on the psychosocial context surrounding treatment (e.g., placebo analgesia) or transient cues that provide information about painful events (e.g., pain-predictive cues). We asked whether placebo analgesia and pain-predictive cues modulate pain through the same mechanisms or dissociable brain pathways. Forty healthy volunteers rated pain in response to noxious heat during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning. We crossed pain-predictive cues, which induce expectations for high or low pain on a trial-by-trial basis, with administration of an inert placebo cream or a control cream. Behavioral analyses revealed a significant interaction, such that predictive cues had weaker effects on pain during placebo blocks than control blocks. This interaction was accompanied by interactions in the insula, pons, and other brain regions. We also observed distinct neural substrates when we compared pure cue effects with pure placebo effects, and only predictive cues modulated responses in nociceptive regions and the Neurologic Pain Signature (NPS; (Wager et al., 2013). The only regions that were influenced similarly by both types of expectations were the rostral anterior cingulate and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. These results indicate that cue-based expectations about stimulus intensity and placebo-based expectations about treatment outcomes are distinct, and that pain researchers should differentiate between sources of expectations. Furthermore, cue-based expectations were associated with more consistent effects than treatment-based expectations, suggesting that clinicians should be particularly mindful of how they present information about impending pain.",Psychology
636,,"In the risky-choice framing effect, most people prefer a certain option over a risky one when the options are framed as gains, but this preference is typically reversed when the options are framed as losses. Past research has largely neglected how the size of this effect varies as a function of the probabilities in the risky option. DeKay et al. (2022) recently reported an inverted-U pattern in which the effect is smaller for extreme probabilities (e.g., .01, .99) than for moderate probabilities. This pattern is predicted by some theories but not others. We report a replication of the inverted-U pattern and other results involving varieties of risk comparisons (certain vs. risky, somewhat risky vs. risky, and certain vs. somewhat risky) in a preregistered online experiment (N = 807). Results indicate that the framing effect is significantly smaller but still sizeable at extreme probabilities. An internal meta-analysis (N = 2,518) confirms the reliability of the inverted-U pattern and its moderation by risk comparison. We also assess how well 5 theories (prospect theory, transfer-of-attention-exchange theory, fuzzy-trace theory, fuzzy-trace theory with rounding of extreme probabilities to 0 or 1, and the priority heuristic) account for 7 features of the data. None of these theories accounts for all of the results, though transfer-of-attention-exchange theory edges out prospect theory, which edges out the others. These results highlight the value of assessing an effect’s generalizability over variations in experimental materials.",Psychology
637,,"Intensive longitudinal data with a large number of timepoints per individual are becoming increasingly common. Such data allow going beyond the classical growth model situation and studying population effects and individual variability not only in trends over time but also in autoregressive effects, cross-lagged effects, and the noise term. Dynamic structural equation models (DSEMs) have become very popular for analyzing intensive longitudinal data. However, when the data contain trends, cycles, or time-varying predictors which have nonlinear effects on the outcome, DSEMs require the practitioner to specify the correct parametric form of the effects, which may be challenging in practice. In this paper we show how to alleviate this issue by introducing regression splines which are able to flexibly learn the underlying function shapes. Our main contribution is thus a building block to the DSEM modeler's toolkit, and we discuss smoothing priors and hierarchical smooth terms using the special cases of two-level lag-1 autoregressive and vector autoregressive models as examples. We illustrate in simulation studies how ignoring nonlinear trends may lead to biased parameter estimates, and then show how to use the proposed framework to model weekly cycles and long-term trends in diary data on alcohol consumption and perceived stress.",Psychology
638,,"Habits are an essential part of everyday decision-making. However, the mechanisms underlying habit formation and expression in humans are difficult to study in the laboratory, owing to a dearth of convenient experimental paradigms that reliably exhibit a key marker of habits – training-induced inflexibility – under ecologically valid conditions. This difficulty is often attributed to the fact that habits are identified in contrast to goal-directed (GD) control, which research participants typically engage strongly in laboratory experiments. To address this gap, we develop a new, short habit learning paradigm that incorporates several features we hypothesized would encourage participants to disengage GD control, enabling habits to exert greater influence over behavior: a hierarchical multi-step trial structure, opportunities for self-correction, and frequent switches between extensively and moderately practiced behaviors. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that overtraining amplifies habitual control, as evidenced by errors biased toward the overtrained context and away from the moderately-trained context at early response times, while later responses remain dominated by GD control. The reliability of this overtraining effect depended on the inclusion of task features designed to dampen GD control. In addition to providing a practical, robust, and flexible tool for studying the cognitive processes underlying habit formation and habitual control, our paradigm moves us beyond the traditional stimulus-response conception of habits, expanding the definition to include more complex, hierarchical behaviors that better reflect naturalistic human habits.",Psychology
639,,"The objective of this systematic review was to (1) identify existing digital interventions for adolescent depression and anxiety, (2) assess the promise of those interventions, and (3) identify characteristics of promising interventions. Six databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Science, EMBASE, MEDLINE, and Google Scholar) were used to conduct searches between September and October 2023. The searches were rerun in June 2024. Twenty studies met the criteria for inclusion, leading to the identification of 17 distinct interventions for analysis. The promise of the interventions was assessed through their effectiveness, the RE-AIM Framework (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance) dimensions, and risk of bias. The evaluation of interventions’ promise deemed three studies as ‘Quite Promising’, six as ‘Slightly Promising’, and eleven as ‘Not Promising’. All promising interventions somewhat met the RE-AIM dimensions. Variability was observed in TIDieR (Template for Intervention Description and Replication) characteristics, including Rationale, Intervention provider, Length and frequency of intervention, and Retention. Factors that potentially contribute to the success or limitation of digital mental health interventions among adolescents are discussed. The review underscores the need to enhance the methodological rigor and to evaluate and report the real-world impact of interventions to ensure they benefit a broader demographic of young people.",Psychology
640,,"Research on music-evoked autobiographical memories has grown rapidly in recent years, suggesting that music can be an effective stimulus for cueing memories from one’s life. One challenging aspect of this type of research is creating a stimulus set that is effective at cueing autobiographical memories in a wide range of individuals. The present work sought to address this issue by creating a normed stimulus set of popular music and popular movie cues. In addition to this methodological aim, we had an empirical aim to identify differences between autobiographical memories cued by music and movies. Participants (N=248) either listened to excerpts of popular music or viewed clips of popular movies. After each stimulus, participants rated it on several dimensions, including emotional valence, emotional arousal, familiarity, and autobiographical salience. Results indicated that certain songs and movies are autobiographically salient across a wide age range of participants. Additionally, we identified that musical cues show a significantly more pronounced reminiscence bump than movie cues, suggesting that music from the reminiscence bump period of life is more effective at triggering memories. Overall, these data provide an important resource for researchers wishing to use popular media to cue autobiographical memories, as well as indicating differences between memories cued by music and movies.",Psychology

643,,"DECISION AND RECOMMENDATION 
Lades, Laffan, Daly, &amp; Delaney (2020) “Daily emotional well‐being during the COVID‐19 pandemic” was determined to contains Moderate Errors that do not affect the core conclusions. That is, errors that have the benefit of being detectable thanks to the presence and sharing of research materials, whose scope is moderate given that a large proportion of the reported results are affected (likely to a small degree), but which do not affect the article’s core conclusions. A determination of Moderate Errors involves the recommendation that the authors seek a correction.
Following the ERROR project’s emergent guidelines, the recommendations associated with a Moderate Errors decision are as follows: 
-	The report, author response, and recommendation have been posted on the ERROR website (error.reviews/reviews/lades-2020) and as a preprint on PsyArXiv (osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/8gtz2). Their associated materials have been posted to OSF (see osf.io/2q3ay).
-	The authors are asked to recognize these errors in future discussions of the article. 
-	The authors are recommended to pursue a correction notice with the journal. Specifically, with regard to:
o	The text on p. 905 states that multiple testing corrections were used. However, corrections were in fact only applied to results in the supplementary materials and not any results reported in the article itself. 11 of 42 (26.2%) statistically significant results reported in the article were not significant after multiple testing corrections. Although, these do not alter the main conclusions. The use of multiple testing corrections should either (a) more clearly state that these corrections were applied only to the results reported in the supplementary materials and not any results reported in the article, or (b) all results reported in text should be those with the multiple testing corrections applied. 
o	The primary analyses reported in the article did not acknowledge dependencies in the data (i.e., each participant completed the survey multiple times). The authors agreed with the reviewer that they should have employed clustered Standard Errors to acknowledge these dependencies. Applying clustered Standard Errors changes the statistical significance of one result (positive affect ~ schooling children), although this does not change the core conclusions. Corrections should be made to the Standard Errors reported in text, the Confidence Intervals in all panels of Figure 1 and Figure S1, and the results reported in Table S2. The “†” significance bar should be removed from the positive affect ~ schooling children result in Table S2.
o	All analyses and summary statistics should use corrected data that use unique participant IDs. A small number of duplicate participant IDs were found by the reviewer, which the authors argue are distinct participants but are not treated as such in the reported analysis. Correcting this error may produce additional changes in the results of the regressions reported in the text, tables, and plots. These magnitude of any such changes is currently unknown but likely to be very small.",Psychology
644,,"Using self-report questionnaire sumscores for this purpose has both theoretical and methodological shortcomings. One of these shortcomings is that the symptom count and the severity of symptoms are obscured by an overall sum score. 
We compared the diagnostic value of the symptom count versus symptom severity captured within sum scores used to assess affective disorders (n = 2947).
For the Inventroy of Depressive Symptomatology – Self Report (IDS-SR) and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), the number of symptoms was more strongly related to depression or anxiety disorders than to the severity of symptoms. For the Fear Questionnaire (FQ), the severity of symptoms was more strongly related to anxiety than to the count of symptoms. 
Our study underscores the distinct and independent roles of symptom count and symptom severity in relation to meeting DSM criteria for affective disorders. Simply aggregating item scores may oversimplify. Researchers and clinicians should contemplate evaluating symptom count and severity as separate entities to enhance diagnostic accuracy.",Psychology
645,,"The attraction effect refers to the impact of an asymmetrically dominated irrelevant option (decoy) in shifting preferences towards its dominant option (target), with respect to another, non-dominant alternative (competitor). This context effect has been observed in multiple studies, yet its practical relevance in real-life situations has recently been questioned, since various factors can modulate, nullify, or even reverse the attraction effect. In this study, we investigate the impact of presentation order and presentation modality (simultaneous or sequential) on the elicitation of the effect in a value-based choice task. Previous studies documented the relevance of these variables in modulating the effect, yet they used perceptual discrimination tasks, raising the question of whether these factors would have the same impact on value-based choice. Our findings confirm that spatial proximity between target and decoy is necessary for eliciting attraction effects in value-based choice (as it is in perceptual discrimination) when options are presented simultaneously; however, when options are presented sequentially, temporal proximity is showed to be irrelevant for the attraction effect, which is observed across all presentation orders (contrary to what was reported in previous studies using perceptual discrimination tasks). These results provide further insight on the importance of both visual arrangement, task demands, and cognitive processing in modulating context effects in decision-making.",Psychology

647,,"This study explores the conditional dependencies among items in Raven’s Colored Progressive Matrices (CPM), a non-verbal measure of cognitive ability and fluid intelligence, within a sample of school-aged children. To this aim, we applied Bayesian networks (BNs), to data obtained from 255 participants, aged 4 to 11 years. We evaluated a variety of models, starting from the complete independence model and progressing to sequential, data-informed structures. The results highlighted that inter-item dependencies were particularly significant among kindergarten-aged children, suggesting that their problem-solving approaches may be influenced by their previous responses. The Sequential Data-Driven model consistently outperformed traditional human-driven hypothesis models, indicating the presence of complex interrelationships that could challenge the assumption of local independence in psychometric assessments. Cross-validation analyses revealed developmental differences in model fit, with optimal performance in kindergarten and increased variability as children transition to primary school. These findings advocate for the development of refined scoring methodologies that incorporate item interdependencies and prompt further investigation into the cognitive processes underlying these dependencies. Our study has implications for the psychometric validation of cognitive assessments, underscoring the importance of integrating complex item relationships in test design and analysis to enhance measurement accuracy and validity.",Psychology
648,,"Previous research indicates that readers may construct a location-invariant letter string representation before associating it with a lexical representation. In neural network modeling, this is achieved with a two-stack model in which a hidden layer first learns to map location-specific letter representations into word-centered positions. Then, another stack is trained to map them into lexical representations. However, the model has been validated only in one language (French). In this study, we replicated the model with a Finnish language corpus having substantially more resembling words (KISSAA, KISSAN, KISSAT) and with modern and accessible programming tools. To gain insight into the model’s coding principles, we also trained the model with random letter strings, analyzed the model’s hidden layer activation patterns, and conducted an error analysis. The results indicated that random letter string training leads to superior letter identity and position coding. However, the natural corpus with many close words leads to a more fine-grained mapping from word-centered letter string representations to lexical representations. Finally, bigram coding may emerge in weights connecting hidden to output nodes. We conclude that the one- or two-stack model seems a potent candidate for developing a universal and comprehensive connectionist model of reading.",Psychology
649,,"Risperidone is an antipsychotic used to treat behavioural symptoms of dementia such as agitation. Guidance stipulates it be used as a last resort and in these cases there is evidence of benefit, however it carries a number of severe side effects, including stroke. Prescribing data suggest regular use outside of this guidance but the reasons for this are unclear. We currently know very little about the first-hand experiences of people involved in prescribing decisions within care homes. This study aimed to understand perceptions around the risks and benefits of risperidone, preferences on how side effect risks are communicated, and how people feel about being able to better predict these risks. Semi-structured interviews and one focus group were conducted with care home residents, relatives, and staff. A focus group was conducted with external healthcare professionals. Using framework analysis, five main themes were identified: 1) the interplay between the person and their symptoms; 2) balancing voices in decision making; 3) what happens before prescription?; 4) bringing together information to make the right decision; 5) what happens after prescription?. Care home staff and relatives of people with dementia were generally uncertain of the risks of risperidone, and the potential side effects were often not explained adequately. Person-centred care was preferred by participants, but there is often no alternative to risperidone as a last resort. While it continues to be prescribed, efforts to minimise harm are required. Specifically, improved education around the risks of risperidone is needed. Relatives wish to be involved in the decision-making process alongside care staff, and their involvement should be optimised with the use of a decision-aid.  Accessible dementia-specific guidance on monitoring risperidone after prescription should also be developed.",Psychology
650,,"While negative risk-taking behavior in adolescents is a classic topic, extant research has long spent little attention to the positive aspects of adolescents’ development. One topic that started to gain more research focus is prosocial risk-taking behavior – defined as behavior where an individual takes a risk to help someone else. However, validated measures are still limitedly available. The goal of the study is to construct and validate a multifaceted measure to assess prosocial risk-taking in adolescents. A sample of 234 Dutch adolescents (149 girls) aged 14-17 filled in the unvalidated prosocial adolescent risk-taking questionnaire (PAR-Q) to perform an exploratory factor analysis to indicate initial factor structure. A separate data sample of 357 Dutch adolescents (208 girls) aged 14-17 filled in the PAR-Q to confirm this factor structure with a confirmatory factor analysis and additional questionnaires for convergent validity. In this sample, also test-retest reliability was assessed. The final two-factor structure, which represented Social and Material prosocial risk subscales, exhibited acceptable internal consistency and excellent test-retest reliability. The PAR-Q correlated positively with prosocial behaviors and empathy. The PAR-Q is a newly validated measure with good psychometric properties that can be used to gain more information on prosocial risk-taking, behavior in adolescents.",Psychology
651,,"Introduction: Medication adherence is influenced by both psychological and medical factors, including risk communication and numeracy skills. The way side-effect information is presented—whether in a positive or negative frame, and whether numerical data is conveyed in frequencies or percentages—can impact adherence. These effects may be more pronounced for individuals with lower numeracy.
Material and Methods: Participants (N = 332) were asked to read a medication description with varying side-effect information based on experimental conditions. They were randomly assigned to a 3 (frame: positive, negative, combined) x 2 (numerical format: percentages, frequencies) between-subjects design. The study assessed risk perception, medication intention, and emotional responses while considering participants’ numeracy levels. 
Results and Discussion: Framing and numerical format significantly influenced risk perception and medication intention. Negative framing and frequency-based formats resulted in higher risk perception and lower medication intention. Moreover, numeracy interacted with the numerical format: individuals with lower numeracy showed higher medication intention in the percentage format and reported more negative emotions in the frequency format.
Conclusions: The way information is framed and presented numerically plays a significant role in shaping risk perception and medication intention. Negative framing and frequency formats tend to increase perceived risk and decrease medication intention. Tailoring communication based on numeracy levels could improve medication adherence.",Psychology
652,,"Emotional intelligence (EI) has been positively associated with relationship quality in romantic couples, but few studies have examined the mechanisms underlying this association. The current study examines the mediating role of extrinsic emotion regulation (regulating your partner’s emotions) on the associations between EI and relationship quality. Specifically, we studied the mediating effects of three extrinsic regulation strategies involving high engagement with the partner’s emotions (cognitive reframing, receptive listening, and valuing). Heterosexual couples (N = 175) completed three waves of surveys across 14 weeks from August to October 2021. EI, extrinsic emotion regulation strategies, and relationship quality were measured at three time points. Actor-Partner Interdependence Mediation Models (APIMeMs) were applied to analyse the dyadic data. Results showed that valuing one’s partner was the only significant mediator linking EI to relationship quality. For both men and women, individuals' EI is associated with better relationship quality for themselves and their partners, through their extrinsic emotion regulation behaviours of valuing their partners. These findings underscore the importance of fostering EI and mutual valuing within couples, which relates to healthier and more successful romantic relationships.",Psychology
653,,"The literature presents two contrasting accounts on the influence of cognitive reflection (tendency to override intuition by engaging in deliberation or analytical thinking) on susceptibility to misinformation. According to the classical reasoning account, rooted in research on evaluation of mainly soft news (sensational, human-interest stories), cognitive reflection improves truth discernment. According to the motivated reasoning account, rooted in research on argument construction about hard (policy-related) issues, cognitive reflection enhances political bias. We integrate these two accounts by examining how the distinction between soft and hard news interacts with individuals’ reasoning style to shape their capacity for truth discernment and susceptibility to political bias. Initially, we conducted an integrative data analysis (IDA) by synthesizing data from existing misinformation studies and incorporating independent ratings of news items along a hard-soft news dimension. We also conducted two experiments—one in the U.S., one in Greece—where participants viewed soft or hard political news. Across the IDA and experiments, participants higher on cognitive reflection were more prone to political bias, but only when evaluating hard news. Cognitive reflection was associated with improved truth discernment for both soft and hard news in the IDA, but not consistently so in the experiments. The findings reconcile discrepancies in the misinformation literature by demonstrating that cognitive reflection is not a one-size-fits-all solution to misinformation: although it is associated with improvement in truth discernment, it is also linked to exacerbated political bias in the case of hard news. We discuss implications of news softening for what qualifies as misinformation.",Psychology
654,,"This Element adopts a naturalistic, cognitive perspective to understand divination. Following an overview of divination and the historical background of its scholarly study, Chapter 2 examines various definitions and proposes a working definition that balances common usage with theoretical coherence. Chapter 3 surveys existing theories of divination, including symbolic and functional perspectives, while critiquing their limitations. Chapter 4 argues for the primacy of cognition in divinatory practices, emphasizing the role of universal cognitive mechanisms and culturally specific worldviews in shaping their plausibility and persistence. Expanding on these ideas, Chapter 5 investigates the interplay between individual cognition and societal processes, highlighting socio-cultural factors such as the preferential reporting of successful outcomes that bolster divination’s perceived efficacy. Finally, Chapter 6 concludes by summarizing the Element’s key arguments and identifying open questions for future research on the cognitive dimension of divination.",Psychology
655,,"The influential model of sentence production developed by Bock and Levelt (1994) posits two stages of grammatical encoding: functional processing and positional processing. This model is sometimes referred to as the ""consensus model"" of grammatical encoding, given its wide support within psycholinguistic research. However, most research in the cognitive neuroscience of syntax does not align well with this two-stage consensus model. We will review recent research on the neurobiology of syntax, focusing on lesion-symptom mapping in people with aphasia, and in particular on the agrammatism-paragrammatism distinction. We will illustrate how a two-stage model of grammatical encoding aligns well with this distinction but does not precisely match the processing levels of functional and positional processing proposed by Bock and Levelt. We will illustrate how this consensus model can be revised in order to better accommodate the data. Finally, we will evaluate extant models of syntax and the brain, illustrating their respective adequacy and inadequacy with respect to accounting for these phenomena as well as their poor alignment with the consensus psycholinguistic model. We argue that models which involve two stages of grammatical encoding are more fruitful for pursuing relationships between psycholinguistics, aphasiology, and neuroscience.",Psychology
656,,"When accused of wrongdoing, a sexual assault perpetrator may express atonement, i.e.,
he may acknowledge harm done, take responsibility, and make amends. Anecdotal observations
suggest that mainstream U.S. audiences respond favorably when high-status perpetrators express
less atonement, such as telling stories that minimize harm, or place responsibility on the victim.
However, empirically, little is known about how perpetrator status and atonement influence
audience responses. Informed by system justification theory, this vignette-based experiment
tested the hypothesis that the more audiences are psychologically invested in an unequal status
quo (i.e., the greater their system justification beliefs), the more they will favor perpetrators (vs.
victims), especially when high-status perpetrators atone less, and low-status perpetrators atone
more. In a pre-registered 2(perpetrator status: low, high) x 3(perpetrator narrative atonement:
low, medium, high) x continuous(participant system justification) between-subjects design, U.S.
adults (N=895) were randomly assigned to read 1 of 6 first-person stories by a white male who
has been accused of sexual assault by a female acquaintance. Dependent measures included
perceived severity of and relative responsibility for the assault, empathy toward perpetrator and
victim, and ratings of their likeability and positive personality traits. Hierarchical regression
analysis revealed that, instead of the hypothesized interactive effects, there were consistent main
effects of system justification and atonement across perpetrator status levels. The greater their
system justification beliefs, the more participants favored perpetrators, the less severe they rated
the assault, and the less they favored victims. Greater perpetrator atonement boosted favorability
ratings for him and the victim. Conversely, less perpetrator atonement diminished his
favorability ratings, but also made the assault appear less severe and less his (vs. the victim’s)
responsibility. Findings underscore the strong influences that perpetrator stories and
psychological investment in an unequal status quo have on perceptions of sexual violence.",Psychology
657,,"Disturbances of emotion are a core feature of psychological disorders generally, and of mood and anxiety disorders in particular. However, it remains unclear what specific patterns of affective disturbance are shared across different symptom domains. Here we examined correlations between emotional disorder symptom severity (anxiety, depression, hypomania, and anhedonia) and affective reactivity to gain and loss outcomes within a decision-making task with embedded sampling of emotional valence (Experiment 1: N = 329; preregistered replication in Experiment 2: N = 524). Using hierarchical Bayesian computational modelling of emotion self-reports, we found that greater affective reactivity to gains and losses within the task was associated with more severe symptoms of both anxiety and hypomania. This suggest that heightened reactivity to both appetitive and aversive outcomes indexes emotional disorder severity across multiple symptom domains of psychopathology, in line with theoretical frameworks that conceptualize affective disturbance as a generalized risk factor for psychopathology.",Psychology
658,,"Syntactic impairments in aphasia can provide a powerful window into the neurobiology of language. Considerable research has focused on agrammatism in nonfluent aphasia, driving a strong association between frontal brain systems and syntax. However, the syndrome of paragrammatism, typically characterized by grammatical errors in fluent aphasia, has recieved far less attention. Recent work has suggested that paragrammatism is primarily associated with posterior temporal-parietal lesions, converging with functional neuroimaging evidence that these regions support hierarchical syntax. However, the holistic perceptual approaches to paragrammatism used in this work suffer from limited inter-rater reliability as well as conflating factors such as speech rate. To remedy these issues, this study reports a system to classify agrammatic and paragrammatic symptoms at the level of the utterance using an objective coding scheme, building on previous analyses by Matchin et al. (2020). Trained speech-pathology students rated transcriptions of 88 retellings of the story of Cinderella from persons with aphasia alongside transcriptions from 53 age-matched healthy controls. Each utterance was classified by the presence of errors corresponding to functional processing (i.e., hierarchical processing) or positional processing (i.e., linearization), along with non-grammatical errors. We found that patients defined holistically using the perceptual approach as agrammatic or paragrammatic doubly dissociated in rates of functional and positional processing, and that qualitative behavioral variables distinguish healthy speech from agrammatic and paragrammatic samples. We suggest that agrammatism and paragrammatism result from distinct breakdowns in syntactic structure building during speech, resulting from damage to distinct syntactic subsystems of the brain.",Psychology
659,,"Deception research has traditionally evaluated how individual differences like personality traits and demographics correlate with lying. However, the establishment of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) as an individual difference that also links to deception remains underexplored. To this end, the present study (N = 784 students) investigated the relationship between ACEs and deception in adulthood. Results indicated that individuals with more (versus less) adverse childhood experiences, particularly those involving maltreatment and victimization, reported more white and big lies, independent of aversive personality traits like narcissism and Machiavellianism. Together, these findings support the dispositional honesty hypothesis, indicating that foundational childhood experience and events can shape or signal deceptive behavior. Generally, the study contributes to our underexamined knowledge base of the developmental antecedents of lying, emphasizing the role that adversity plays during childhood to influence deceptive behavior beyond commonly studied personality traits.",Psychology
660,,"Apart from recent exceptions, decades of research suggest humans perform poorly in deception detection studies. Accuracy is only slightly better than chance, and humans are often truth-biased. We report 12 studies using gemini-1.5-flash, accessed through the Viewpoints.ai research platform, making veracity judgments of humans, systematically varying the nature and duration of the communication, modality, the truth-lie base rate, and AI persona. AI performed best (57.5%) when detecting truths and lies involving feelings about friends, although it was notably truth-biased (71.7%). However, in assessing cheating interrogations, AI was lie-biased by judging more than three-quarters of interviewees as cheating liars. In assessing interviews where humans perform at rates over 70%, AI performed below chance, and accuracy plummeted to 15.9% with an ecological base-rate. AI yielded results different than prior human studies and exhibited a strong guilt bias in transgression denials. We presently advocate against using certain large language models for lie detection.",Psychology
661,,"Background: Young people with childhood adversity (CA) tend to show altered autobiographical memory processing, such as reduced access to details of specific positive events, which may represent a potential mechanism through which CA increases mental health risk. Although friendship support is known to improve mental health outcomes in this population, the mechanisms underlying this protective relationship remain largely unknown.

Objective: This study aimed to investigate associations between perceived friendship support, valence-specific autobiographical memory recall, perceived stress, and depressive symptoms in young people with CA.

Participants and Setting: The study included 100 young people (aged 18-24 years) with low to moderate levels of CA, recruited from the general population across the Netherlands.

Methods: Hierarchical multiple regressions were conducted to examine relationships between friendship support, positive and negative autobiographical memory specificity, perceived stress, and depressive symptoms.

Results: Friendship support was not linked to positive or negative autobiographical memory specificity. However, it was associated with lower perceived stress (β = -0.44, p &lt; .001) and fewer depressive symptoms (β = -0.21, p = .041). Autobiographical memory specificity showed no relationship with perceived stress or depressive symptoms. Furthermore, more severe CA (β = 0.21, p = .002) and higher perceived stress (β = 0.56, p &lt; .001) were both associated with more depressive symptoms.

Conclusions: These findings point towards a model where friendship support exerts its protective mental health effects possibly through reducing perceived stress in young people with CA, rather than through influencing the specificity of positive or negative autobiographical memories.",Psychology
662,,"Exposure-based CBT is an effective treatment for anxiety disorders. However, individual differences in response to exposure indicate that many patients do not fully benefit from therapy. Examining individual changes over time in threat expectancy likelihood, a theorized working mechanism of exposure as proposed by the Inhibitory Retrieval Theory, may help optimize individual treatment success. This study aimed to examine the dynamics of learning during one exposure exercise for fear of public speaking and the retention of learning in daily life. Participants with elevated fear of public speaking (70 women, M age = 23.10) completed an exposure exercise designed to violate an idiosyncratic threat expectancy. They gave two, three, or four presentations to at least halve threat expectancy likelihood. Ecological momentary assessments were used to measure threat expectancy likelihood eight times a day for four days before and four days after the exposure exercise. Results showed individual differences in how fast threat expectancy likelihood decreased during the exposure exercise. Furthermore, there were individual differences in how much this translated to a decrease in threat expectancy likelihood in daily life and how long participants retained the decrease. Additionally, after the exposure exercise, we found a decrease in threat expectancy severity, anticipatory anxiety, avoidance tendency, and an increase in willingness to give a presentation in daily life. Future research could examine whether individual differences in the dynamics of learning and retention in daily life following an exposure exercise are clinically relevant as predictor of overall treatment success.",Psychology
663,,"Digital communication and information systems (DCISs) have become ubiquitous. Adolescents are avid users of these technologies. As access to and use of DCISs has increased among adolescents, daily life and adolescent social interaction patterns have shifted in profound ways. Although the causal relationship between DCIS use and adolescent well-being is not clear, it is clear that the economy driving DCIS innovation is not designed to promote adolescent well-being. Yet, DCISs possess characteristics that make them promising avenues for well-being promotion because of their accessibility, ability to scale up, and the potential for personalization. In this essay, we propose that strengthening adolescent well-being skills through DCIS interventions may provide the necessary conditions for adaptive adolescent DCIS use at a public health scale, leading to improved adolescent well-being.",Psychology
664,,"Textbook psychology holds that people usually prefer a certain option over a risky one when options are framed as gains but prefer the opposite when options are framed as losses. However, this pattern can be amplified, eliminated, or reversed depending on whether option descriptions include only positive information (e.g., 200 people will be saved), only negative information (e.g., 400 people will not be saved), or both. Previous studies suggest that framing effects arise only when option descriptions are mismatched across frames. Using online and student samples (Ns = 906 and 521), we investigated 81 framing-effect variants created from matched and mismatched pairs of 18 option descriptions (nine in each frame). Description valence or gist explained substantial variation in risk preferences (prospect theory does not predict such variation), but a considerable framing effect remained in our balanced design. Risky-choice framing effects appear to be partly—but not completely—the result of mismatched comparisons.",Psychology
665,,"Background: Registered Reports are an emerging publication format, which emphasizes methodological rigor over results. Integrating this format into education allows one to teach research skills when data collection is infeasible.

Objective: To evaluate the implementation of Registered Reports for replication research in an undergraduate psychology methods course.

Method: A five-week course was conducted where students developed Stage 1 Registered Reports proposing to replicate published findings. The evaluation was conducted by the students through consensus meetings held during a paper-in-a-day workshop, which also served as a collaborative writing activity for this paper.

Results: Registered Reports scaffolded students’ research skills, enhanced motivation, and instilled open science values. Students gained practical insights into reproducible research practices, but worried about the necessary support to continue applying them and expressed concerns about public pre-registration, citing fears of criticism.

Conclusion: Registered Reports are valuable for teaching research methods, particularly in courses where data collection is impractical. However, institutional support and curriculum-wide integration are essential to sustain the benefits they provide.

Teaching Implications: Instructors should leverage the full feedback opportunities of Registered Reports and be mindful of the hidden costs of engaging students in open science practices. Paper-in-a-day workshops can be explored as standalone educational activities.",Psychology
666,,"Cross-linguistically, lexicons tend to be more phonetically clustered than required by the phonotactics of the language; that is, words within a language are more similar to each other than they need to be. In this study, we investigate how this property evolves under the influence of competing communicative pressures: a production-side pressure to re-use more easily articulated sounds, and a comprehension-side pressure for distinctiveness of wordforms. In an exemplar-based computational model and a communication experiment using a miniature artificial language, we show that natural-language-like levels of clustering emerge from a trade-off between these pressures. With only one pressure at work, the resulting lexicons tend to inhabit an extreme region of the possible design space: production pressures alone give rise to maximally clustered lexicons, while comprehension pressures alone give rise to maximally disperse lexicons. We also test whether clustering emerges more strongly for high-frequency items, but our results lend support only to a weak relationship between frequency and clustering. Overall, this study adds to a growing body of evidence showing that mechanisms operating at the level of individual language users and individual episodes of communication can give rise to emergent structural properties of language.",Psychology

Eighteen- to 24-month-olds exhibited distinct looking patterns in response to the consistent versus inconsistent informants (Cohen’s d = 0.42), demonstrating greater gaze following toward the emotionally consistent adult. Conversely, 12- to 18-month-olds did not differentiate between these conditions. Findings suggest that the ability to detect and utilize emotional consistency as a cue for social engagement emerges during the second year of life.",Psychology

This preregistered review includes 22 studies on wellbeing and mental health indicators in the context of curiosity. Our findings indicate that curiosity predominantly exhibits positive associations with wellbeing outcomes such as life satisfaction and positivism, and a negative association with depression indicators. Additionally, some types of curiosity revealed inconsistent associations with wellbeing, linking positively with mental health indicators and negatively with positive wellbeing measures.

Using a reinforcement learning model, we simulate the use of three different theorized strategies in an adversarial reward learning environment that requires very high variability. Model simulations with a policy-gradient meta-learning algorithm show that agents could respond more optimally in such environments by (1) relying on a stochastic generator, (2) increasing one’s learning rate to allow for faster interactions between reinforcement learning and extinction, or (3) strategically upvalue unchosen actions using a frequency-based memory. After demonstrating the theoretical benefit of each of these strategies, we fitted our model on existing datasets of human-, pigeons- and rat behavior in adversarial environments. We show that, while all three species can engage in highly variable behavior, only humans strategically upvalue unchosen actions as a strategy to achieve variability.",Psychology
673,,"Defense attorneys for autistic criminal defendants sometimes argue that difficulties inferring others’ intentions and motivations—often referred to as Theory of Mind (ToM)—considered to characterize autistic people render them vulnerable to exploitation. In this chapter we examine the empirical evidence for such claims. Current evidence derives primarily from studies of autistic and non-autistic adults’ responding in traditional deception detection paradigms and in several novel paradigms used to probe autistic adults’ ability to detect and respond adaptively to others’ criminal intent during interactions. This evidence does not support the perspective that autistic adults are inherently vulnerable to criminal exploitation, although it does indicate that ToM difficulties and low verbal ability are independent risk factors, regardless of autism diagnostic status. Although marked ToM difficulties are more prevalent in autistic adult samples, they are not ubiquitous, thereby highlighting the importance of basing legal defense arguments on measured rather than assumed ToM characteristics. Despite the recent emergence of methodologies for exploring criminal vulnerability, further significant empirical advances will likely depend on the development of paradigms which assess autistic adults’ ability to respond appropriately when confronted with problematic situations that capture the complexities of real-life interactions.",Psychology
674,,"Cybersickness remains a significant challenge for virtual reality (VR) applications, particularly in highly immersive environments. This study examined the effects of immersion, task performance, and individual differences on cybersickness symptoms across multiple stages of VR exposure. Forty-seven participants aged 18–45 completed a within-subjects design that involved the Cybersickness in Virtual Reality Questionnaire (CSQ-VR) and the Deary–Liewald Reaction Time (DLRT) task. Cybersickness symptoms were assessed across four stages: before and after VR immersion, and before and after a 12 min rollercoaster ride designed to induce cybersickness. The results showed significant increases in symptoms following the rollercoaster ride, with partial recovery during the post-ride tasks. Eye–hand coordination tasks, performed after the ride and VR immersion, mitigated nausea, as well as vestibular, and oculomotor symptoms, suggesting that task engagement plays a key role in alleviating cybersickness. The key predictors of symptom severity included a susceptibility to motion sickness and gaming experience, particularly proficiency in first-person shooter (FPS) games, which was associated with a reduced cybersickness intensity. While task engagement reduced symptoms in the later stages, particularly nausea and vestibular discomfort, overall cybersickness levels remained elevated post-immersion. These findings underscore the importance of task timing, individual differences, and immersive experience design in developing strategies to mitigate cybersickness and enhance user experiences in VR environments.",Psychology

The GSQ exhibited strong reliability and validity, highlighting its potential as a valuable tool. Gaming skills positively affected executive function, memory, overall cognition, cognitive flexibility, and emotion recognition, except for empathy. Various game genres had different effects on cognitive and affective abilities, with verbal fluency influenced mainly by sports, executive functions by action, strategy, and puzzle, and emotion recognition positively impacted by action and puzzle but negatively by sports and strategy games.

Abstract
Background: Given that VR is used in multiple domains, understanding the effects of cybersickness on human cognition and motor skills and the factors contributing to cybersickness is becoming increasing important. This study aimed to explore the predictors of cybersickness and its interplay with cognitive and motor skills. Methods: 30 participants, 20–45 years old, completed the MSSQ and the CSQ-VR, and were immersed in VR. During immersion, they were exposed to a roller coaster ride. Before and after the ride, participants responded to the CSQ-VR and performed VR-based cognitive and psychomotor tasks. After the VR session, participants completed the CSQ-VR again. Results: Motion sickness susceptibility, during adulthood, was the most prominent predictor of cybersickness. Pupil dilation emerged as a significant predictor of cybersickness. Experience with videogaming was a significant predictor of cybersickness and cognitive/motor functions. Cybersickness negatively affected visuospatial working memory and psychomotor skills. Overall the intensity of cybersickness’s nausea and vestibular symptoms significantly decreased after removing the VR headset. Conclusions: In order of importance, motion sickness susceptibility and gaming experience are significant predictors of cybersickness. Pupil dilation appears to be a cybersickness biomarker. Cybersickness affects visuospatial working memory and psychomotor skills. Concerning user experience, cybersickness and its effects on performance should be examined during and not after immersion.",Psychology
679,,"This scoping review examines the broad applications, risks, and ethical challenges associated with Extended Reality (XR) technologies, including Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), and Mixed Reality (MR), within the context of Metaverse. XR is revolutionizing fields such as immersive learning in education, medical and professional training, neuropsychological assessment, therapeutic interventions, arts, entertainment, retail, e-commerce, remote work, sports, architecture, urban planning, and cultural heritage preservation. The integration of multimodal technologies—haptics, eye-, face-, and body tracking, and brain–computer interfaces—enhances user engagement and interactivity, playing a key role in shaping the immersive experiences in the Metaverse. However, XR’s expansion raises serious concerns, including data privacy risks, cybersecurity vulnerabilities, cybersickness, addiction, dissociation, harassment, bullying, and misinformation. These psychological, social, and security challenges are further complicated by intense advertising, manipulation of public opinion, and social inequality, which could disproportionately affect vulnerable individuals and social groups. This review emphasizes the urgent need for robust ethical frameworks and regulatory guidelines to address these risks while promoting equitable access, privacy, autonomy, and mental well-being. As XR technologies increasingly integrate with artificial intelligence, responsible governance is essential to ensure the safe and beneficial development of the Metaverse and the broader application of XR in enhancing human development.",Psychology

Specifically, referring to the existing literature on these three dimensions  (Ngueutsa et al., 2021; Auzoult and Ngueutsa, 2019; Zohar, 2010, respectively), we hypothesized that both reasoned acceptance of the rules and acceptance of the rules based on collective experience, mediate the effect of three dimensions of cultural beliefs - namely, beliefs related to the protection and celebration of life, to group identification and belonging, and to manifestations  of joy - on perceived safety climate in these workers. The study was conducted by questionnaire on 219 workers from sub-Saharan Africa origin, living in France. Although preliminary analyses did not enable us to test our mediation hypothesis, results revealed that cultural beliefs relating to the protection and celebration of life and those related to group identification and belonging predicted reasoned acceptance of the rules. Similarly, reasoned acceptance of the rules determined the perceived safety climate. Reasoned acceptance of the rules, cultural beliefs related to safety issues and to cultural identities appears to be determinants of safety climate. In a multicultural professional context, cultural heritage of workers should be taken into account when designing safety management practices.",Psychology
683,,"Cette étude analyse les explications causales spontanées des contaminations à la Covid-19 fournies par la population générale et la nature des facteurs favorisant ou empêchant ces contaminations, sur la période de mai à août 2020. Un total de 450 participants résidant en France et au Cameroun ont été invités à répondre à une question ouverte portant sur l’explication causale des contaminations, notamment les facteurs susceptibles de les empêcher ou de les favoriser. Les discours des participants ont fait l’objet d’une analyse thématique mixte (déductive et inductive). Les résultats de l'analyse déductive révèlent une proportion significativement plus élevée d'explications externes des contaminations (comportements inadaptés d’autrui, mesures gouvernementales inadéquates, manque de contrôle et laxisme dans l’application des mesures, environnement propice à la contamination) par rapport aux explications internes (non-respect des mesures barrières par soi, sous-estimation du risque pour soi). L'analyse inductive confirme cette tendance à privilégier les causes externes pour expliquer les contaminations, comparativement aux causes internes. Les explications externes sont prédominantes en tant que facteurs aussi bien favorisant qu’empêchant les contaminations. En outre, lorsque les participants identifient un facteur comme une cause de contamination, ils ont tendance à proposer une mesure de prévention ciblant cette cause. Ces résultats sont discutés à la lumière de l’approche de l’explication causale naïve de l’accident et de la théorie des systèmes de pensées. Ils suggèrent de prendre en compte le niveau d'implication personnelle des individus dans la conception des messages et des dispositifs transparents et cohérents avec les croyances causales de la population lors des campagnes de prévention.",Psychology
684,,"Social media is a preferred means of communication among young people. Several studies suggest that the use of Facebook has an impact on the behavior of young users. To the best of our knowledge, no study to date has investigated this issue in the African context. We analyzed the link between Facebook use and aggressive behavior among young Cameroonians. Specifically, we hypothesized that the type and intensity of Facebook use can predict aggressive behavior among this population. Five hundred and sixteen university students in Cameroon answered a questionnaire comprising four scales regarding Facebook use which measured: i) the intensity of use, ii) active and passive use, iii) problematic use, and iv) aggressive behavior. The analyses highlighted two interaction effects linked to aggressive behavior; the first was between passive use and the intensity of use on aggressive behavior, and the second between problematic use and passive use. We discuss the results taking into account the cultural dimension in the two interactions, and suggest avenues to prevent aggression and violent publicized.",Psychology
685,,"Research has largely examined how climate change is seen to have an impact on eating practices, namely the promotion of a vegetarian diet in the Euro-American and other WEIRD contexts. Here, we examine these issues in India, where championing vegetarianism closely intersects with casteism. Social psychologists have argued that preference for a meat or plant-only diet is negotiated in the face of concerns over animal harm. We then examine another dilemma where promoting vegetarianism is seen as advocating for marginalization and oppression of caste groups. Using discursive and rhetorical psychology we examined interactions on Reddit where promoting vegetarianism was challenged for its casteism, creating a dilemma. Findings show that, first, users constructed and negotiated the uniqueness of the Indian context for promoting vegetarianism, and second, those promoting vegetarianism did not consider casteism as problematic and endorsed the marginalization of meat-eaters. Users’ constructions of the context were made in ways to negotiate responsibility for the climate crisis in challenging the imposition of vegetarianism. The findings then show that the salience of context in which specific forms of diet are promoted as a response to the climate crisis is central to how these forms of promotion are taken-up. These findings are discussed in relation to research on promoting vegetarianism and management of prejudice in contemporary social psychology.",Psychology
686,,"Purpose: This study aims 1) to assess the psychometric properties of the APACS-Fr, a comprehensive test of pragmatic abilities for French speaking adolescents and adults, and 2) to use it to study lifespan variations in pragmatic abilities, to determine when pragmatic abilities peak. 
Methods: The APACS-Fr was adapted from the original Italian APACS and then used in a cross-sectional design to assess the pragmatic abilities of 184 participants with no known disorder, aged between 14 and 88 years old. The psychometric properties of the test were analyzed from these data and age effects were assessed through LOESS regression and multiple linear regressions. 
Results: The APACS-Fr was characterized by a good overall internal consistency, a good to excellent inter-rater reliability and a good structural validity with a unifactorial structure. Age analysis revealed that accuracy consistently improves between 14 and approximately 25-30 years old. A decline in performance was also visible in some tasks after 70 years-old. Multiple regressions revealed that SES was an additional supporting factor on most tasks; in contrast, gender never resulted as a relevant predictor of performance. 
Conclusions: Pragmatic alibies keep improving during late adolescence and early adulthood, before reaching a plateau around 25-30 years old, and they may decline after 70 years old. Taking this pattern into account should make research as well as clinical practice with adolescents and adults more accurate. The APACS-Fr embraces such a life-span perspective. Thanks to its good psychometric properties, this freely distributed tool appears suitable to assess pragmatic abilities in French speaking adolescents and adults.",Psychology
687,,"Objective: Bedtime procrastination describes going to bed later than intended, leading to sleep deprivation. Although difficulty falling asleep and pre-sleep arousal is assumed to cause bedtime procrastination, the relationship has not been directly examined. In this study, we examined whether difficulty falling asleep and pre-sleep arousal lead to bedtime procrastination.

Methods: We conducted a longitudinal survey, administered three times at 1-month intervals, among participants aged 18–65 years; 1,102 participants were included in the final analysis. Participants were asked to complete a questionnaire that included bedtime procrastination, difficulty falling asleep, and pre-sleep arousal measures. The random intercept cross-lagged panel model was used to test the hypothesis that difficulty falling asleep and pre-sleep arousal increased bedtime procrastination. 

Results: No significant cross-lagged path was observed from difficulty falling asleep to bedtime procrastination, and a significant positive path from pre-sleep arousal to bedtime procrastination was observed between Times 2 and 3.

Conclusion: Although difficulty falling asleep did not lead to bedtime procrastination, pre-sleep arousal partially led to bedtime procrastination. We examined the association between pre-sleep arousal and bedtime procrastination using a more rigorous method than that in previous studies, implying that decreasing pre-sleep arousal is effective in relieving bedtime procrastination.",Psychology
688,,"Adolescence listens to pop and rock music more than any other genres of music in their everyday life. Music has been shown to influence various social aspects of adolescence socialization process, including self and social identity. In this study, I analyzed representative samples of both pop and classical music lyrics to shed lights on the cultural changes in the sentiment, lexical diversity, topics, and moral values across centuries. Through this comparison, is it found that sentiment has become more negative and aroused, the languages used simpler, topics more frequently mentioning money, sex, and violence, and the moral values reflecting less care, loyal, and sanctity. Further investigation is needed to reveal the consequences of this shift to today’s adolescence’s mental health and behavior patterns.",Psychology
689,,"The perception of colors involves many contexts in which human beings develop connections. Colors and temperatures are seemingly unrelated concepts, yet our brains have created ways of linking them. According to the literature, primarily from Western cultures, colors such as red and yellow are typically associated with warmth, whereas blue is associated with coolness. However, the universality, cultural specificity, and developmental trajectory of this association remain poorly understood. To explore whether the association between color and temperature is a phenomenon limited to certain cultures or a collectively shared mechanism among many cultures, we conducted an online survey using a set of 20 colors comprising five hues and four tones. Children and adults from various regions of the world were asked to choose a color that felt warmer during pairwise comparisons. The results demonstrate universality in hues and cultural specificity, particularly in tones (lightness and saturation elements of colors). In addition, age-specific comparisons between cultures revealed different trajectories of this association during development, highlighting cultural influences.",Psychology
690,,"Since the turn of the 20th century, empirical studies using music stimuli to test key theories in music affects have mushroomed, in which selecting or designing music stimuli became a common practice. However, the majority of the studies didn’t justify the selecting methods of the music stimuli within a consistent framework. More than half of the research rely on a modest amount of familiar music stimuli from the past, targeting a narrow range of discrete emotions, raising concerns on comparability, and reproducibility across studies. In this article, I designed a novel diagrammatic method named Abstraction-Measure Diagram (AMD), inspired by Juslin's ICINAS-BRECVEMAC framework to address the current issues. I also illustrated how to draw AMD with understudied affects in previous research and recommended a few selected repertoire as new music stimuli. The goal is to initiate a study of “musi-metrics” (which I term) for music stimuli best practice aiming to promote consistency, comparability, and reproducibility in the field, and enhance research rigor for the future. An additional wish through this article is to raise more awareness for the timeless aesthetic legacy throughout music history.",Psychology
691,,"This study investigated the early development of cultural variations in audiovisual speech perception in infancy. Focusing on the McGurk effect, we examined the audiovisual speech integration in 6- to 12-month-old infants from Canadian (N = 55) and Chinese (N = 80) cultural contexts. Infants were presented with auditory syllables paired with videos of a female face articulating syllables in a ""moving-still-moving-still"" pattern, designed to elicit alternating auditory percepts should the integration occurred. We recorded infants’ looking time to index their auditory perception and found robust audiovisual integration in Canadian infants from 6 months. By contrast, Chinese infants exhibited a more protracted developmental pattern, showing developmental changes in integration capacity over the same age range. Experiment 2 further demonstrated that the presentation of other-race faces differentially impacted the integration performance across cultures. These findings coincided with notable differences in caregiving practices, where Canadian infants predominantly experienced nuclear family care, whereas Chinese infants received more extended family care. These findings suggest that cultural variations in audiovisual integration emerge early in infancy and may be influenced by early social experiences, particularly caregiving styles. The observed divergence aligns with previous research on older populations, indicating that cultural differences in audiovisual speech perception manifest early and persist into adulthood. This study highlights the importance of cultural context in understanding the development of multisensory speech perception, with implications for theories of language acquisition, early identification of atypical development, and the design of culturally sensitive language education programs.",Psychology
692,,"To identify men motivated and able to protect their offspring, selection could have favored perceptual acuity toward morphological features diagnostic of men’s formidability. One route through which formidability inferences emerge is facial width-to-height ratio (fWHR), a facial structure heuristically associated with physical prowess. We conducted four experiments across demographically diverse samples to determine how fWHR informs perceptions of men’s parental abilities and motives. Perceivers ascribed more effectiveness in protecting offspring in high-fWHR men (Study 1). Perceptions of their strength underpinned this ascription (Study 2). Inferences of men’s paternal ability tracked both configural and featural processing (Study 3) and expected motivations for protection (Study 4). Results contribute to a functional perspective of fWHR to understand inferences of the motivational costs and benefits in parenting in men.",Psychology
693,,"The pupil response has long been considered a robust marker of cognitive load. In the context of semantic processing, research has demonstrated that the pupil dilates in response to stimuli which violate contextual expectations (e.g. events presented out of chronological order). However, the scope of this relationship has yet to be fully elucidated. For example, incongruent object-scene relationships, while comprehensively explored by eye-tracking and electrophysiology research, have yet to be investigated via pupillometry. In this study, we measured pupil size in response to an object-scene congruency task. Participants were presented with a photorealistic background scene and instructed to fixate their gaze on a cued point within the scene. Upon recovery of pupil size to baseline, a congruent object (i.e. an object which fit into the overall meaning of the scene) or an incongruent object appeared at the cued fixation point for the remainder of each trial. We hypothesized that incongruent objects would result in greater mean pupil dilation from baseline than congruent objects, due to the increase in cognitive effort required for semantic processing of incongruent objects within a scene. Yet, in opposition to our hypothesis, the results of a time course analysis revealed that pupil size was significantly greater for the congruent condition than the incongruent condition. The resulting implications for understanding pupil dilation as a physiological marker for high-level cognitive processes such as semantic integration are discussed.",Psychology
694,,"The past few years have seen a surge in the application of quantum theory methodologies and quantum-like modeling in fields such as cognition, psychology, and decision-making. Despite the success of this approach in explaining various psychological phenomena — such as order, conjunction, disjunction, and response replicability effects — there remains a potential dissatisfaction due to its lack of clear connection to neurophysiological processes in the brain. Currently, it remains a phenomenological approach.
In this paper, we develop a quantum-like representation of networks of communicating neurons. This representation is not based on standard quantum theory but on {\it generalized probability theory} (GPT), with a focus on the operational measurement framework. Specifically, we use a version of GPT that relies on ordered linear state spaces rather than the traditional complex Hilbert spaces. A network of communicating neurons is modeled as a weighted directed graph, which is encoded by its weight matrix. The state space of these weight matrices is embedded within the GPT framework, incorporating effect-observables and state updates within the theory of measurement instruments — a critical aspect of this model. This GPT-based approach successfully reproduces key quantum-like effects, such as order, non-repeatability, and disjunction effects (commonly associated with decision interference). Moreover, this framework supports quantum-like modeling in medical diagnostics for neurological conditions such as depression and epilepsy.
While this paper focuses primarily on cognition and neuronal networks, the proposed formalism and methodology can be directly applied to a wide range of biological and social networks.",Psychology
695,,"Communication is ubiquitous in human social life. There are many possible modes of human communication but language use is plainly of special interest: because language plays a critical role in culture and society; and because languages are important cultural products in their own right, with their own distinctive properties, in particular grammatical structure. However, we do not presently have any compelling synthesis of our understanding of communication and our understanding of grammar. This problem is important because synthesizing knowledge across neighboring domains considerably deepens understanding in its own right, and can bring new perspectives to bear on old issues. Mature syntheses are major scientific breakthroughs. Here I present a synthesis of communication and grammar. I argue in particular that contextualist theories of communication, and constructionist approaches to the description of grammars, together provide a cohesive picture. Both bodies of work have proved enormously influential in their respective subfields, but their synthesis provides a unified picture of considerable clarity. Linguistic communication is a coordination problem on the speaker’s informative intentions; and grammars are networks of micro-conventions for ostensive communication, that enable language users to resolve this coordination problem far more easily than they otherwise would. I identify precisely what makes languages, languages; and what language users are doing when they ‘use language’. This synthesis in turn provides fresh perspectives on many classical issues in the language sciences. I sketch three examples: literal meaning and construction modulation; language learning; and the evolutionary emergence of language in our species.",Psychology
696,,"Objectives: This study addresses the pressing need for culturally adapted mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) for the Arab-Bedouin population in Israel, a marginalized group facing socio-economic hardships, limited access to mental health resources, and unique cultural challenges. Specifically, the research examines the association between mindfulness and mental well-being within this community and investigates how Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) might be adapted to meet their cultural needs.
Methods: Two complementary studies were conducted. The first was a cross-sectional quantitative study involving 181 Arab-Bedouin participants who completed validated scales measuring trait mindfulness, self-compassion, and key mental health indicators, including well-being, anxiety, depression, and perceived stress. The second study employed qualitative methods, with in-depth interviews of 8 Arab-Bedouin mental health professionals who completed an adapted MBSR program. Thematic analysis was applied to explore their perspectives on necessary cultural adaptations for effective implementation.
Results: Quantitative analysis showed strong positive associations between mindfulness, self-compassion, and mental well-being, with higher mindfulness and self-compassion linked to lower anxiety, depression, and stress. Qualitative findings emphasized essential cultural adaptations, including delivering MBSR in Arabic, integrating Islamic values, and providing gender-sensitive practices, all of which fostered cultural alignment and increased participant engagement. Participants highlighted the value of the instructor’s cultural background and the use of relatable examples. 
Conclusions: Mindfulness practices are associated with improved mental health outcomes in the Arab-Bedouin community. Culturally adapting MBSR to address language, gender norms, and Islamic teachings enhances its relevance and effectiveness, highlighting the potential of tailored MBIs in promoting well-being in marginalized communities.",Psychology
697,,"Based on findings from analyses with cross-lagged panel models, Lin et al. (2024) suggested an impact of social media addiction on aggressive behaviors. Here, we simulated data to resemble the data used by Lin et al. We used triangulation and fitted complementary models to the simulated data and found contradicting increasing, decreasing, and null effects of initial social media addiction on subsequent change in aggression. These divergent findings suggest that it is premature to assume an increasing effect of social media addiction on aggression and the suggestion by Lin et al. in this regard can be challenged. It is important for researchers to be aware that correlations, including adjusted cross-lagged effects, do not prove causality in order not to overinterpret findings, something that appears to have happened to Lin et al. We recommend researchers to triangulate by fitting complementary models to their data in order to evaluate if observed effects may be due to true causal effects or if they appear to be spurious.",Psychology
698,,"Gendered division of household labour is marked by its pervasive inequality, in that women routinely do more housework across the world. But still, most women continue to find it fair, even if they are systematically contributing more. How can evolutionary accounts of fairness explain that fact? We review three major accounts focusing on their psychological claims, discussing what evidence in support of their account and how well they can explain perceptions of fairness about gendered division of household labour. These are three distinct accounts which describe fairness judgements a) arising from the following of local social norms (Henrich and colleagues), b) a sense of equity which evolved in a partner choice ecology (André, Baumard and colleagues) and c) as a sense of egalitarianism, which evolved in response to human coordination problems (Binmore). We find that none of these accounts are fully compatible with observations of gender inequalities in households, though each contain important insights, which can be integrated into a more comprehensive theory. We end our review by providing an outline of what such a comprehensive theory might look like and provide a tool for researchers to enable seamless exploration of multiple factors underlying fairness judgements.",Psychology
699,,"There are concerns that reliance on external resources (e.g., information on digital devices) may be harmful to our own internal memory. Here, in a pre-registered study, we investigated how the reliability of an external resource (i.e., whether the information will be available when needed) affects young children’s use of it. In our tablet-based Shopping Game, children picked items from a store based on a shopping list. Importantly, the store and the list were not visible simultaneously, but children could toggle between them. In the reliable condition, the list was always available. In the unreliable condition, children were led to believe that the list might disappear. We found that 5-6-year-old children (N = 37) relied more on the list – referring back to it more often and more briefly, and remembering fewer items – when they perceived the list as reliably available (and vice versa, reducing trips to the list by studying it longer, and remembering more, when it was perceived as unreliably available). Nearly all children also identified the reliable condition as easier and preferred. In short, young children not only recognize the opportunity provided by reliably available external resources, but adapt their cognitive effort accordingly.",Psychology

701,,"Arabic emphatic consonants are claimed to be late-acquired, likely due to their motoric complexity, involving both coronal and pharyngeal/uvular constrictions. Children's production has largely been studied using impressionistic data, with limited acoustic analysis. This study acoustically examines the acquisition of emphatic consonants in Saudi-Hijazi-Arabic-speaking children aged 3 to 6 years. Children performed a real-word repetition task, after which consonantal and vocalic cues to the plain-emphatic contrast were measured. The results show that children produce both types of acoustic cues, with an age-related increase in the acoustic plain-emphatic contrast and an overall alignment with adult patterns. Larger acoustic contrasts were found in vowels preceding rather than following consonants in word-medial positions, with no evidence observed for a difference between word-initial and word-final positions. The plain-emphatic contrast was greater for stops than fricatives and larger for female than male children. These findings are discussed in relation to the development of coarticulated consonants.",Psychology
702,,"Specific phobia (SP) is a prevalent mental disorder. Exposure-based treatments are the most effective therapy. Surprisingly, little is known about the intrinsic functional connectivity of SP and its modification by treatment, possibly due to a strong focus on a presumed fear network. Hypothesis-driven a priori selection of brain regions does not allow the full extent of potential changes in SP and the modulating effects of therapy to be captured. Therefore, we use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in combination with hypothesis-free, data-driven functional connectivity multivariate pattern analysis (fc-MVPA), which takes into account the entire functional connectome, to identify differences between N=72 individuals with SP and a non-phobic control group (CG, N=82). The SP group then received a one-session exposure treatment and was scanned again after 16 weeks.
Fc-MVPA showed the largest differences between SP and CG in somatomotor regions with higher connectivity to temporal nodes of the default network and anti-correlations to the frontoparietal network. Stronger connectivity values in the pre- compared to the post-treatment condition was evident in visual regions. while anti-correlations to the frontoparietal network were reduced. Post-hoc comparisons showed that the connectivity patterns of the SP after treatment between almost all identified nodes of both contrasts ('SP vs. CG' and 'pre vs. post') were comparable to those of the control group. Given the known functions of the identified networks, the results suggest that exposure treatment may improve the control of perceptual and action regions, leading to better environmental prediction of mentally constructed scenes and improved action control.",Psychology
703,,"Substance use and psychosis frequently co-occur and are complexly interrelated. Nevertheless, the legal system sometimes requires conclusions regarding the causal effects of substance use on a defendant’s psychosis (e.g., to determine insanity defense eligibility - including “settled” insanity from chronic substance use). Objectives: We sought to understand how courts and mental health professionals conceptualize and resolve settled insanity claims. Hypotheses: Mental health professionals’ approach to settled insanity cases will map well onto the relevant body of clinical psychological science. Method: We conducted a case law review (Study 1: N=51 settled insanity cases), coding history and outcomes, substances involved, viability from a clinical science perspective, and qualitative reasons for case outcomes. And we conducted an experiment to evaluate the perspectives of mental health experts on the legal intersection of substance use and mental illness across three types of cases (Study 2: N=310 U.S. licensed psychologists, 52% female, M_age=37.66, M_experience=18.71 years). Results: In Study 1, 29.41% of the settled insanity cases were potentially viable on clinical science grounds, whereas only a single legal case (1.96%) was actually successful. Qualitative analyses showed courts often use circular reasoning to disallow settled insanity based on the very characteristics that define it. Study 2 found mental health experts evaluate evidence of permanent mental illness similarly, regardless of whether a legal defense of insanity is general or settled in nature. And they largely opine defendants who are actively and voluntarily intoxicated at the time of the crime are not legally insane, consistent with the law. Conclusions: The legal doctrine of settled insanity does not map well onto clinical reality and unnecessarily complicates the intersection of intoxication and mental illness by prompting insoluble questions about the etiology of mental illness.",Psychology
704,,"Objective: The supplementary motor area (SMA) demonstrates abnormal beta activity (13-30 Hz) during speech and limb movement tasks in neurological conditions such as Parkinson’s disease (PD). Transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation (tACS) has demonstrated promising improvement in motor and non-motor functions by entraining endogenous neural oscillations. We conducted an exploratory study on the modulatory effects of personalized beta high-definition (HD)-tACS over the left SMA on speech production and limb movement. Approach: In a repeated-measures experiment, twenty-two neurotypical young adults were recruited to participate in four stimulation conditions: sham, High-Definition Transcranial Random Noise Stimulation (HD-tRNS), and HD-tACS tuned to each individual’s frequency of maximal SMA beta activity (identified using source-localized EEG) during speech (tuned-to-speech; TtS) and limb movement (tuned-to-limb; TtL). All participants completed a 25-minute sham/active stimulation over the left SMA, followed by an interleaved speech production and limb movement task. Main Results: Behavioral results showed that active stimulation resulted in more pronounced improvements in reaction times compared to the sham condition, regardless of the active stimulation type. The neural correlates of this aftereffect were indicated by a prominent modulation in delta power in prefrontal and frontocentral electrodes during speech and limb movement tasks following personalized beta TtS and TtL HD-tACS, relative to sham and tRNS. 
Significance: Personalized beta HD-tACS modulated delta oscillations, instead of beta rhythms, in a task-specific manner, highlighting the brain’s adaptive response. These findings have implications for neurological conditions such as PD, which are characterized by deficits in speech production and limb motor coordination.",Psychology
705,,"In response to hate speech, representatives of minorities use reclaimed derogatory language. Until now, psychological research has treated reclamation as a uniform concept in terms of the motivations of minorities, despite theoretical perspectives suggesting otherwise. In this paper, based on previous research, we described three motivations for using reclaimed language: to regain control, for humorous purposes, and to consolidate relationships in the community. We reported the process of creating a new scale to measure these three motivations. The three-dimensional structure of the Motivation for Language Reclamation Scale (MLRS) was validated in two studies (N = 362; N = 141) among gay people in Poland. We also showed that the motivations have various implications for collective action. The MLRS provides researchers and practitioners with a reliable tool for exploring the psychological processes involved in language reclamation and its effects on minority group members.",Psychology

Analyses tested associations between ANS (heart rate, skin conductance) and measures of psychopathic traits (Self-Report Psychopathy Scale-III (SRP-III), Inventory of Callous-Unemotional (ICU) traits, Levenson Self-Report Psychopathy Scale (LSRP), Sensation Seeking Scale – Form V (SSS-V)). Baseline skin conductance was negatively associated with Erratic Lifestyle (SRP-III) and SSS-V total scores. Heart rate during the SSST had a negative association with Callous Affect (SRP). During the countdown task there was a negative association between skin conductance in anticipation of signaled noise blasts and Interpersonal Manipulation (SRP), and a negative association between change in heart rate after noise blasts in unsignaled trials and Erratic Lifestyle (SRP) and Factor 2 Psychopathy (LSRP).",Psychology
707,,"The contribution of language to the narrative self is well-known, but does language play a role in creating the sense of minimal self? In this paper, we investigated whether variations in sentence structure affected the speaker's sense of minimal self. We examined whether expressing the first-person subject's actions and perceptions in sentences influenced the speaker's sense of agency and ownership, which are key components of the minimal self. Previous studies explored the influence of expressing a third-person subject’s actions on the interpretation of agency, but not that of the first-person subject. To ensure consistent sentence structures across various expressions, we used Japanese example sentences. We found that the sense of agency of the first-person subject was significantly lower in the absence of actions or perceptions compared to when they were present. With regard to the sense of ownership, we found that it was significantly lower when both action and perception were absent (e.g., “I saw a star” vs. “A star was out”). Interestingly, when the action was absent but perception was present (e.g., “I saw a star” vs. “A star was visible to me”), the sense of ownership varied significantly depending on the context. These results suggested that variations in linguistic structures within utterances could distinctly impact the senses of agency and ownership. In cognitive linguistics it is argued that the concept of “subjectivity” is essential for understanding various linguistic phenomena. By applying the experimental methods developed in this paper, we aim not only to clarify what is implied by “subjectivity” in a broader context through the study of the self but also to introduce a method for measuring subjectivity. Furthermore, we believe that this understanding can facilitate the establishment of a connection between the linguistic narrative self and the embodied minimal self.",Psychology
708,,"Narrative discourse impairments are well documented in individuals with moderate-severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). Studies of narrative discourse (i.e., story generation or story retelling) in this population have frequently focused on impairment of semantic relations across utterances and the larger discourse context (e.g., cohesion, coherence, story grammar). Less attention has been given to the temporal organization of narrative retelling in TBI. We applied temporal contiguity analyses, a technique traditionally used to characterize temporal organization of free recall of wordlists, to quantify the temporal organization of participants’ story retellings with respect to the order in which the narrator originally presented the story details. We also conducted a parallel analysis of temporal contiguity of wordlist recall using data from the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning test. Both participants with moderate-severe TBI and non-injured peers demonstrated above chance temporal organization and a tendency to make short transitions in the forward direction when recalling items in both the narrative recall and wordlist recall task. However, these effects were significantly reduced in the TBI group. This suggests that overall, their free recall performance was less temporally ordered, and they were more likely to make larger jumps between story details (or words in the wordlist recall task) than their non-injured peers when recalling stories. Examining free recall at multiple timepoints revealed that while repetition (i.e., multiple presentations of the word list) increased temporal organization of recall, long delays (i.e., one week) decreased temporal organization for both the TBI and non-injured groups. We propose that reduced temporal organization of narrative recall in individuals with moderate-severe TBI is linked to impairments in the declarative relational memory system. In line with retrieved-context models of free recall, memory disruption not only impacts the total number of story details recalled, but also the ability to use temporal context to encode and retrieve items in a sequentially organized way.",Psychology

710,,"There has been a lack of success in locating the neural correlates of consciousness, not just in the complex brains of humans but also in animals with simpler brain structures. This paper considers whether the root of the problem is simply that we have been looking for the wrong thing. 

In contrast to most theories of the mind and consciousness, the B-Man Stra/Tac model proposes that consciousness has a very limited functional scope, a conclusion consistent with the Orch OR theory of consciousness. This limited scope opens the possibility that consciousness could be implemented within a single cell. A cell that has been highly adapted for consciousness by millions of years of evolution.

This paper firstly considers the current search for the neural correlates of consciousness and identifies weaknesses in the approach; secondly looks at the argument for a single cell consciousness; and finally defines indicators that may lead to its discovery.

The localization of a single cell in the brain would of course be a difficult task, however the brain structures supporting that cell may be readily identifiable. It is interesting to consider that such structures may have already been found by neurologists, but their significance overlooked, and that following the ideas given in this paper the neural correlates of consciousness could be finally located.",Psychology

Neuropsychology involves the study of relatively rare or hard-to-access participants, creating practical challenges that, according to our survey, are perceived as barriers to preregistration. We survey the available routes to preregistration, and suggest that the barriers are all surmountable in one way or another. However, there is a tension, in that higher levels of bias control require greater restriction over the flexibility of preregistered studies, but such flexibility is often essential for neuropsychological research. Researchers must therefore consider which route provides the right balance of rigour and pragmatic flexibility to render a preregistered project viable for them. By mapping out the issues and potential solutions, and by signposting relevant resources and publication routes, we hope to facilitate well-reasoned decision-making and empower neuropsychologists to enhance the transparency and rigour of their research.",Psychology
712,,"The interleaving effect refers to the finding that repeatedly switching between categories during study or practice enhances learning relative to focusing on only one category at a time. Two studies investigated whether this effect is moderated by individual differences in fluid intelligence (gF), episodic memory (EM) ability, and/or working memory capacity (WMC). In Study 1 (undergraduate students) and Study 2 (adult online participants), higher gF scores were associated with larger interleaving effects for perceptual categories (artists’ painting styles). Additionally, higher EM ability was associated with larger interleaving effects for perceptual categories in Study 1, whereas an analogous pattern was observed for WMC in Study 2. There were no indications that the investigated cognitive abilities moderated the interleaving effect for text-based categories (psychological disorders). Overall, these findings suggest that higher-ability learners benefit especially from interleaving in the case of perceptual category learning, with attendant theoretical and pedagogical implications.",Psychology
713,,"The pretesting effect refers to the finding that guessing the answers to test questions before learning the correct answers improves memory relative to studying (or reading) without prior guessing. Although the pretesting effect is robust and has been demonstrated across multiple studies, its magnitude varies across individuals. Two studies investigated whether individual differences in working memory capacity (WMC), episodic memory ability (EM), and/or fluid intelligence (gF) help explain that variation. In Study 1, lower gF scores were associated with a larger pretesting effect among undergraduate students, stemming from lower performance on read items. In Study 2, involving adult online participants, observed patterns were less consistent, but lower WMC scores were associated with larger pretesting effects, again due to lower performance on read items. Together, these patterns suggest that pretesting can homologize memory ability across individuals, although to an extent that may vary across learner populations and cognitive abilities. That conclusion and other findings are interpreted in the context of relevant individual differences research and theories related to pretesting and memory phenomena.",Psychology
714,,"The adaptive staircase method, frequently employed in tasks like the Stop-Signal Task (SST), dynamically adjusts task difficulty based on participant performance. We introduce Staircase Segment Length (SSL) as a metric to quantify participant adaptability, measuring the consecutive stop trials during which the Stop-Signal Delay (SSD) remains stable. Short SSLs may reflect quick adaptability and stable performance, while longer SSLs could indicate slower adjustments, potentially linked to cognitive fatigue or fluctuations in engagement. Developed in the context of response inhibition, SSL may also serve as a complementary metric to accuracy or fatigue in various adaptive tasks utilizing staircase methods, offering insights into participant dynamics.",Psychology
715,,"This study investigated the role of domain-general cognitive processes, specifically inhibitory
control, verbal working memory (WM), and nonverbal reasoning, on children’s productive
grammar skills, focusing on Turkish past tense (e.g., fırçala-DI brush-PAST.3sg) and causative
suffix (e.g., fırçala-t-TI brush-CAUSE.3sg), representing the broader categories of inflectional
versus derivational morphology, respectively. We tested 84 5-year-old Turkish-learning children
from a densely populated district in Istanbul, Türkiye on a sentence completion task to assess the
use of morphology. Children were more successful in producing the correct suffix for the past
tense than causative suffix, when using both familiar and pseudo verbs. Zero-order correlations
showed significant relations between correct suffix use and all cognitive assessments. However,
regression analyses revealed that only nonverbal reasoning predicted children’s overall correct
suffix use and inhibition predicted it only for the past tense with pseudo verbs. Hence, children
who have better reasoning abilities may have more robustly abstracted the grammar rules of their
native language. Children with better inhibitory control can more effectively suppress the primed
present tense verb and correctly use the past tense. This ability is particularly evident when
dealing with pseudo verbs, which make the task more abstract. These findings imply the
consideration of domain-general cognition in the development of abstract grammar in childhood.",Psychology
716,,"Interpersonal touch plays an essential role in emotional regulation. However, the mechanisms underpinning emotional regulation via interpersonal touch remain obscure. This study investigated inter-brain synchrony (IBS) during the evaluation of affective images in the context of interpersonal touch, and examined the role of IBS in alleviating negative emotional responses. We recruited 47 dyads (N=94) female participants. Each dyads participant viewed affective images (negative and neutral valence) and evaluated their valence and arousal during touch and no touch. During the task, their neural activities in the prefrontal regions were recorded using functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS)-based hyper-scanning. Our results demonstrated that interpersonal touch buffers individuals’ experience of negative emotions and increases IBS. Furthermore, the IBS mediated the association between interpersonal touch and the arousal scores of negative stimuli. Thus, we concluded that IBS may represent an underlying neural mechanism of the regulation of negative emotion between the touch sender and receiver. Notably, in friend, IBS was a positive predictor of friendship quality. Future studies may uncover whether inter-brain synchrony can serve as a neurobiological marker of the dyad's emotional regulation, and can be modified by touch interventions.",Psychology
717,,"In increasing numbers of classrooms worldwide, students use digital learning software. However, we know little about the trajectories of usage and the performance within such digital learning software over the academic year. This study analyzed real-world longitudinal data from a mathematics learning software used in classrooms in Germany and the Netherlands (~16,000 students who worked on &gt;23 million problems). We evaluated students' usage and performance trajectories across an academic year by examining the percentage of students using the software, worked-through problems, active days and weeks, as well as performance. Our results indicate a decline in both usage and performance over the course of the academic year, with overall lower usage in Germany than in the Netherlands. Our findings highlight the need for further research into the factors maintaining or increasing the usage of and performance in classroom-integrated digital learning software over extended periods.",Psychology
718,,"Although several studies have suggested acute adversity can stimulate improved functioning, very few have used prospective designs, counterfactual models, and instrumental variables to establish potential causal links. Using a theoretical framework of psychosocial gains from adversity, two natural experiments, and causal inference techniques, we investigated the impact of acute adversity on adaptive functioning and its mediation through social and prosocial factors. Study 1 (n = 250 bereaved spouses; n = 83 married controls) used a prospective investigation of late life bereavement with pre- and post-loss assessments to examine these questions. At 6-months post-loss, bereaved participants, compared to married controls, reported increased ordinary social interaction, improved instrumental support, reduced hassles with friends and relatives, and an increase in formal social meetings. Average causal mediational analyses found that increased ordinary social interactions and perceptions of support mediated a reduction in depression and anxiety symptoms, relative to pre-loss levels. Study 2 used a similar prospective natural experiment but of severe hurricane exposure (n = 1182 flooded participants; n = 3162 non-flooded controls). An instrumental variable analysis revealed that flood had causal effects on increased social support and prosocial volunteering. As with bereavement, average causal mediation analyses supported a favorable effect of flood on increased life satisfaction and health perceptions through social support and prosocial volunteering. Consistent with evolutionary accounts of reciprocal altruism, these effects were stronger when social cohesion was perceived as higher. Findings support a more expansive account of the effects of acute adversity that includes positive effects through adaptive social and prosocial processes.",Psychology
719,,"Perseverative thought (PT), a multi-dimensional thought process, robustly predicts internalizing psychopathology. PT also predicts general emotion regulation (ER) deficits, which may be due to problematic selection of ER strategies, including engagement (i.e., reappraisal, acceptance, and problem-solving) and disengagement strategies (i.e., experiential avoidance, distraction, expressive suppression). This study investigates how different PT dimensions, captured through written language, predict subsequent ER strategy selection. Participants included 413 college students who completed an experimental paradigm once a day for ten days. Each night, they underwent a PT induction writing task, were instructed to regulate their emotions, and reported on their ER strategy use. We used multilevel logistic regression to examine the associations between seven PT dimensions (i.e., valence, self-focus, interpersonal, discrepancy, situational certainty, temporal orientation, and repetitiveness) and six ER strategies. At the within-individual level, five PT dimensions predicted an increased likelihood of disengagement strategies and a decreased likelihood of selecting engagement strategies, whereas one dimension predicted the opposite pattern. Individuals may respond to PT episodes by selecting ER strategies to avoid negative thoughts or experiences rather than processing them. Most PT dimensions predicted momentary ER selections in a pattern that, if becoming habitual and indiscriminate, relates to higher psychopathology. Overall, this study supported PT dimensions as important contextual features for understanding ER processes. Additionally, language-based measures of PT yielded meaningful associations with emotional processes in daily life, highlighting the benefits of computational linguistics and a dimensional approach to risk factors for psychopathology.",Psychology
720,,"This study evaluated the capability of Claude 3.5 Sonnet (a large language model, LLM) to generate quantitatively analyzable data. Two datasets were generated: biological measurements for 327 land animals and simulated questionnaire responses for 202 famous people. For the biological data, Claude estimated 29 characteristics (e.g., size, speed, aggressiveness) as z-scores relative to all land animals. For the psychometric data, Claude provided predicted responses to 60 Likert-style questions from PhillyMatch.org for each famous person. Validation of biological estimates against the AnAge database showed strong correlations for animal size (r=0.85) and metabolic rate (r=-0.74). Network analysis of the biological data revealed meaningful taxonomic clustering, with mammals distinctly separated from other classes and interpretable exceptions (e.g., golden poison frog clustering with reptiles due to toxin resistance). Factor analysis of the psychometric data yielded four interpretable factors: Conservative Traditionalism, Impulsive Escapism, Pro-Family Orientation, and Sport-Focused Conventionalism. Network analysis of famous individuals showed meaningful clustering beyond simple professional categories, such as grouping individuals with violent histories regardless of their primary occupation. Notably, Claude's direct prediction of factor structure without quantitative data differed from the analysis of its generated data, suggesting distinct implicit and explicit knowledge representations. While these results demonstrate LLMs' potential for generating analyzable quantitative data, further validation against real-world data is needed before application in high-stakes domains",Psychology
721,,"Semantic similarity plays an ambiguous role in models of human cognition. On the one hand, it is often viewed as a foundational construct that shapes how we categorize, learn, and make inferences about objects and their properties. On the other hand, a host of behavioral evidence suggests that similarity is too rigid to explain the flexibility of inductive inference. We present the Integrated Semantics and Control — Context Inference (ISC-CI) model to resolve this tension, proposing that flexible inference emerges within a system that dynamically reshapes represented semantic similarities amongst stimuli depending upon the immediate context. The ISC-CI model builds on prior models of semantics and control that learn how to build and flexibly access semantic knowledge from observing the statistical relationships between objects, their properties, and the contexts in which these occur. Critically, it introduces a new mechanism that infers a suitable representation of context for both familiar and novel scenarios, without any direct labeling in the environment. The inferred context allows the system to selectively weight different dimensions within its representational space depending on the items being processed. Through simulations and experiments, we demonstrate that the ISC-CI model provides a coherent account of performance across inductive inference and semantic similarity tasks, including classic tasks that have long challenges theories of induction, offering a unified account of these cognitive processes that highlights the importance of context. We conclude by considering the implications of these findings for broader questions in cognitive science and artificial intelligence.",Psychology
722,,"This study examined how students' beliefs about their ability to learn (mindset) relate to their grades in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) subjects. We looked at two types of mindset beliefs: general beliefs about intelligence and specific beliefs about math ability. The study included 1,250 middle and high school students who completed surveys about their mindset beliefs. We also collected their grades in math, science, and engineering courses. Using multiple regression analysis, we found that students' mindset beliefs significantly predicted their grades in math and science, but not in engineering. For math grades, both general mindset and math-specific mindset were important predictors, explaining 3.7% of differences in grades beyond what demographic factors (gender, race, and grade level) explained. For science grades, general mindset was a significant predictor, explaining 5.4% of grade differences. We found no significant relationship between mindset and engineering grades, possibly because we had fewer students taking engineering courses. These findings suggest that students who believe their abilities can grow tend to perform better in math and science. The results can help teachers and school leaders develop better ways to support students in STEM subjects. Future research should study these relationships over time and include more students taking engineering courses to understand better how mindset affects learning across all STEM subjects.",Psychology
723,,"The cross-lagged panel network (CLPN) model is a version of the classic cross-lagged panel model (CLPM). The CLPN can be used to model a large number of cross-lagged effects between nodes (such as symptoms of ill health) across two waves of measurement. In spite of a robust debate about the pitfalls of using correlational data to infer causality, researchers using the CLPN often interpret findings in causal terms. We show with simulations that CLPN can indicate cross-lagged effects even if data have been generated without any direct effects between nodes/symptoms. Hence, findings from CLPN:s may be spurious and should not be interpreted in causal terms if used to model non-experimental data. We have previously proposed a method of triangulation to scrutinize findings from the CLPM. Triangulation can also be used to reduce the false-positive risk when using the CLPN. We show by reanalysis of data from a previous study how triangulation can be applied, finding that positive cross-lagged effects between some symptoms of depression and anxiety probably were spurious, rather than due to genuine increasing effects, as alternative models indicated simultaneous and paradoxical increasing and decreasing effects.",Psychology
724,,"Major depressive disorder is a leading cause of disability among adolescents. Perseverative negative self-referential thoughts are a promising treatment target. Mindfulness-based real-time fMRI neurofeedback (mbNF), which guides mindfulness practice with feedback to train the downregulation of the default mode network (DMN), is an intervention targeting such negative self-referential thoughts. This study builds on a registered NIMH-supported trial testing the optimal dosing of mbNF on downregulating DMN activation among depressed adolescents. Adolescents (N=90), ages 13-18-years-old, with major depressive disorder will be randomized to receive either a 15- or 30-minute mbNF session. Before and after mbNF, participants will complete a self-referential encoding fMRI task, wherein they categorize whether trait adjectives describe themselves or a friend. It is hypothesized that a 30-minute versus 15-minute mbNF dose will relate to: (1) larger decreases in behavioral negative self-referential biases and (2) larger decreases in DMN activation during self-referential processing.",Psychology
725,,"Measurement invariance (MI) is often treated as a statistical prerequisite for meaningful comparisons of constructs across groups or time points. However, this perspective overlooks the substantive implications (a lack of) MI can have for psychological theories of constructs. In this paper, we frame MI as a causal concept with theoretical significance. We present a causal framework based on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) that allows researchers to reason about potential causes of non-invariance and include them in their modeling strategy. We argue that non-invariance should not be seen as prohibitive for further exploration and analyses but as an opportunity to generate new insights about constructs and their measurement. That is, under non-invariance, data need a different treatment than simply comparing constructs between groups and causal reasoning can guide researchers in this regard. We demonstrate the causal framework through an application to the study of acquiescent response style. We further discuss an extension of the causal framework to longitudinal designs. When investigating the invariance of measurements over time, the framework can help to take into account expected or desired non-invariance; for example, when constructs evolve over time or certain interventions might change measurement models. By presenting MI as a substantive finding with theoretical implications, we aim to bridge the gap between methodological rigor and applied research reality.",Psychology
726,,"In recent decades, women’s representation in power positions has increased alongside a global decline in anti-egalitarian biases. These egalitarian shifts provide the ideal context to examine the boundary conditions of the motivators of group-based inequality. Accordingly, we investigate the possibility that rising gender equality over the last 14 years has attenuated the relationship between group-based (anti-)egalitarianism (namely, social dominance orientation) and system justification. Multi-level analysis of longitudinal data from 43,924 women shows that anti-egalitarian beliefs predicted increases in system justification. But as hypothesized, increases in gender equality attenuated the positive correlation between anti-egalitarian beliefs and justification of the status quo. These associations were particularly pronounced among women from majoritized groups who benefit most from gender equality. Results replicate across robustness checks and offer a critical update to our understanding of egalitarianism by showing that egalitarians may engage in system justification when the status quo becomes more equal.",Psychology
727,,"Background: Stressful life events (SLEs) are associated with increased risk of depression or anxiety. Coping mechanisms may moderate this relationship but little is known on this topic in young people or in Latin America. 

Aim: To investigate whether coping strategies predict odds of depression and/or anxiety and moderate the relationship between SLEs and depression and/or anxiety in young people in Peru, Lima, and Bogotá. 

Method: Using case-control data from people aged 15-24, we used logistic regression to examine associations between coping mechanism, SLEs, and caseness for depression or anxiety, adjusting for sociodemographic and socioeconomic factors. We included interaction terms to model whether this association varied depending on coping mechanisms (positive cognitive restructuring, problem-focused, support-seeking, distraction, avoidant). 

Results: We included 1437 cases and 965 controls. Cases reported less use of positive cognitive restructuring (OR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.57-0.75) and problem-focused coping (OR: 0.82; 95% CI: 0.73-0.93), and more use of avoidance than controls (OR: 1.33; 95% CI: 1.19-1.50) in adjusted models. They had greater odds of reporting lifetime (OR: 1.07; 95% CI: 1.04-1.10) and past-year (OR: 1.05; 95% CI: 1.01-1.10) SLEs than controls. We found weak, but consistent evidence of effect modification; the association between lifetime SLEs and case-control status was stronger in those who used less support-seeking (p=.09), problem-focused coping (p=.08), or positive cognitive restructuring (p=.09). 

Conclusions: Relationships between SLEs, coping mechanisms and depression/anxiety appear similar in these Latin American cities to other contexts. Active coping strategies may ameliorate the impact of SLEs on mental health of young people.",Psychology
728,,"When defining concepts for scientific work, researchers consider various desiderata (desired characteristics) that are derived from higher level meta-desiderata regarding accepted goals of scientific work and how to act towards achieving them. Although these desiderata are often implicit, they significantly impact researchers' processes of defining and selecting concepts, ultimately influencing research outcomes, communication, and knowledge production. We evaluate the selection and application of desiderata for defining cross-disciplinary concepts dependent upon higher level meta-desiderata working from the example that if one believes that science ought to strive for providing systematic knowledge about the world (level 1), and if one believes that the ease of communication will positively affect the process of attaining that kind of knowledge (level 2), then one ought to strive for definitions of concepts that provide as much as possible of the list of features we argue for (level 3). Using psychological concepts as our examples we offer a proposed list of six desiderata: precision, specificity, theory-neutrality, explanation- neutrality, operational ease, folk-level understanding. The goal is to facilitate researchers' consideration of appropriate desiderata and, where their meta-desiderata match the example provided, promote the adoption and utilization of these desiderata in their work. Given the backdrop of conceptual change and conceptual creep, this aspect, though less discussed, plays a crucial role in shaping our research and knowledge production.",Psychology
729,,"Teamwork involves the collaboration of individuals to achieve shared goals that surpass individual capabilities. As a team-level construct, team cognition underpins effective teamwork by integrating individual expertise and shared understanding. Identifying the causes of inefficiencies or poor team performance is critical for implementing targeted interventions and fostering the development of team cognition. This study introduces and evaluates eight teamwork cognitive diagnostic models (TCDMs) designed to analyze teamwork response data, diagnose individual cognitive attributes, and assess teamwork quality. The models can be used to identify strengths and weaknesses in team cognition and determine whether poor performance arises from cognitive deficiencies or collaborative issues. Two simulation studies were conducted to assess the psychometric properties of the models under diverse conditions, followed by a teamwork reasoning task to demonstrate their application. The results showed that TCDMs achieve robust parameter estimation, effectively diagnose individual attributes, and assess teamwork quality while pinpointing the causes of poor performance. These findings underscore the utility of TCDMs in understanding, diagnosing, and improving team cognition, offering a foundation for future research and practical applications in teamwork-based assessments.",Psychology
730,,"Three preregistered cross-cultural studies (N=6049 across India, Singapore, and the United States) tested how belief in karma shapes victim blaming and helping. Study 1 found that belief in karmic causality positively predicts a variety of system-justifying beliefs that legitimate social inequalities, but experimental reminders of karma also encouraged generosity towards others experiencing financial hardship.  Studies 2-3 tested whether karma framing had different effects on generosity towards different recipients, who varied in their level of need and reason for need. Thinking about karma changed the importance of recipient characteristics, with need being less predictive and external attributions more predictive of giving when thinking about karma. Overall, experimental reminders of karma only reliably increased generosity towards recipients whose financial need was no fault of their own, showing that karmic beliefs draw attention to the reasons for people’s bad fortune, and evoke responses to misfortune that are sensitive to naturalistic explanations.",Psychology

732,,"The extraction and analysis of pitch underpin speech and music recognition, sound segregation, and other auditory tasks. Perceptually, pitch can be represented as a helix composed of two factors: height monotonically aligns with frequency, while chroma cyclically repeats at doubled frequencies. Although the early perceptual and neurophysiological mechanisms for extracting pitch from acoustic signals have been extensively investigated, the equally essential subsequent stages that bridge to high-level auditory cognition remain less well understood. How does the brain represent perceptual attributes of pitch at higher-order processing stages and how are the neural representations formed over time? We used a machine learning approach to decode time-resolved neural responses of human listeners (10 females and 7 males) measured by magnetoencephalography across different pitches, hypothesizing that different pitches sharing similar neural representations would result in reduced decoding performance. We show that pitch can be decoded from lower-frequency neural responses within auditory-frontal cortical regions. Specifically, linear mixed-effect modeling reveals that height and chroma explain decoding performance of delta band (0.5-4 Hz) neural activity at distinct latencies: a long-lasting height effect precedes a transient chroma effect, followed by a recurrence of height after chroma, indicating sequential processing stages associated with unique perceptual and neural characteristics. Furthermore, the localization analyses of the decoder demonstrate that height and chroma are associated with overlapping cortical regions, with differences observed in the right orbital and polar frontal cortex. The data provide a perspective motivating new hypotheses on the mechanisms of pitch representation.",Psychology
733,,"Although poststroke aphasia has traditionally been defined as a language disorder, some studies have suggested that other cognitive abilities might also be affected. The purpose of this review was to examine the extent to which impairments in domain-general abilities such as memory, attention, executive functions, and reasoning co-occur in people with aphasia (PWA) due to stroke. A search was conducted for studies that assessed both language and domain-general abilities behaviorally in people with aphasia and were published between the year range 2000-2023 in multiple databases. Synthesis of the results was organized according to the interactions between domain-general and linguistic abilities investigated by each study. We reviewed 23 studies in total. Overall, the articles included showed evidence for a significant prevalence of other cognitive deficits in post-stroke aphasia that interact with the severity of linguistic impairment, functional communication, and recovery outcomes. We highlight some methodological factors that should be considered when studying the relationship between language and domain-general impairments in the recovery of post-stroke aphasia, as well as the still unanswered questions about such interaction and the clinical implications of acknowledging that aphasia is not only a spectrum of profiles with diverse language impairments but also altered cognitive abilities.",Psychology
734,,"National average IQs can be used to calculate a global average IQ. However, due to differences in population sizes, they are not normally distributed, and it is impossible to calculate the IQ distribution from this average. To estimate the number of people in the world with an IQ above a given value, it is necessary to go through the intermediate calculation of a theoretical average IQ following a Normal Distribution. Using the average IQ and population data of 204 countries, this article provides the formula for calculating this intermediate and gives figures for IQs from 55 to 160 in steps of 5 IQ points. It shows that there are many more high IQs than the world average would suggest. For example, there are about as many people in the world with an IQ above 157 as there would be if the world average were 100 and IQ were distributed according to a normal distribution.",Psychology
735,,"This study examines the coping mechanisms and resilience strategies of Arab-Bedouin in Israel, an ethnic minority facing systemic exclusion and socio-cultural barriers. The research explores their lived experiences within a collectivist and conservative society, addressing the psychological impacts of marginalization and the potential of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) as a personal and communal resilience tool. Eight Arab-Bedouin mental health professionals (five men, three women) participated in an eight-week MBSR program delivered in Arabic. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews conducted before and after the program. A qualitative approach grounded in thematic analysis was employed to understand participants’ perspectives on mindfulness and its integration into their personal and professional lives. Pre-program interviews revealed participants’ emotional burdens related to systemic exclusion, racism, and intra-community stereotypes, alongside reliance on family, religious practices, and connection to nature as coping strategies. Post-program findings highlighted improved emotional regulation, reduced reactivity, and greater presence in daily activities through mindfulness practices such as breathing exercises. Participants reported enhanced interpersonal relationships, including improved empathy and communication. While mindfulness was empowering on a personal level, its limitations in addressing systemic inequalities were acknowledged.
This study enriches existing literature on mindfulness in marginalized populations, highlighting its potential to empower Arab-Bedouins by fostering resilience and mitigating emotional burdens. Insights from this research underscore the importance of culturally sensitive interventions in supporting both personal and professional well-being in minority communities.",Psychology
736,,"The development of computers and the Internet has transformed our lives beyond recognition. Learning, working, shopping, and navigating while driving have all evolved significantly compared to just a few years ago.
This study explored the relationship between attitudes toward physical activity in the real world and attitudes toward activity in the digital environment. We examined the relationship between attitudes toward learning, working, navigating, and receiving services in online (digital) environments and those in physical environments. The study utilized self-report questionnaires to assess the attitudes of participants. 
A negative relationship was identified between attitudes toward traditional classroom learning and attitudes toward learning in a digital environment. This finding indicates that the two types of classrooms are perceived as distinct environments rather than as a single unified space.
A negative relationship was identified between attitudes toward office work and those toward remote work. This finding indicates that the two work environments are perceived as distinct rather than as a single environment.
A negative relationship was also identified between attitudes toward navigation without computers and attitudes toward navigation using computers. This finding indicates that the two navigation environments are perceived as distinct rather than a single environment.
In contrast, a positive relationship was identified between attitudes toward services provided through digital means and those provided by human agents. This finding suggests that the service experience delivered through digital channels is similar to that provided by human agents.",Psychology

This preregistered study examined longitudinal associations between body image and eating disturbance, psychological distress, and substance use over one year among 365 diverse young adults (54% BIPOC, Mage = 20.77) using structural equation modeling. Higher body image disturbance and substance misuse at Time 1 were associated with increased psychological distress at Time 2, with no significant bidirectional relationships found. Body image disturbance did not predict subsequent alcohol use or substance misuse. LGBQ+ young adults reported higher levels of psychological distress and substance misuse compared to heterosexual peers at Time 1, and women reported higher levels of body image and eating disturbance and psychological distress compared to men at Time 1. This research addresses the gap in empirical understanding of longitudinal associations between body image and eating disturbance, psychological distress, and substance use to inform targeted interventions.

We assessed internal consistency and test-retest reliability, convergent and divergent validity, and predictive validity to demonstrate the strong psychometric properties of the new scale. The new scale offers a concise, psychometrically robust tool for research and clinical applications, with implications for advancing prevention and intervention efforts targeting body image disturbance and overall health in diverse populations.",Psychology
739,,"The experience of sensations and thoughts as bound to an individual self is a central aspect of consciousness. The bodily self is a prime example—we automatically perceive our body as our own, as an essential part of ourselves. However, the relationship between the bodily self and conscious awareness remains unclear. We developed a psychophysical paradigm to quantify sensory integration, sensory evidence accumulation, and conscious awareness and their relationships within a robotically controlled rubber hand illusion paradigm that probes the sense of body ownership—a crucial aspect of the bodily self. Using signal-detection analysis, metacognitive computational modelling, and drift‒diffusion modelling, we found that conscious awareness reports closely reflected the objective discrimination of body ownership, as sensory integration and sensory evidence accumulation systematically varied. This suggests that conscious awareness and the bodily self are deeply intertwined and that sensory integration mechanisms underpinning bodily self-perception operate at the level of conscious awareness.",Psychology
740,,"Goal-directed actions are defined by their sensitivity to the causal association between actions and outcomes, as well as the subjective value ascribed to those outcomes. When this sensitivity diminishes, actions may transition into habitual behavior. Based on recent findings from animal studies, we hypothesized that delaying outcomes relative to actions would weaken sensitivity to outcome revaluation and reduce action rates. In three experiments ( N = 290 ), participants made fictitious investments in companies within different contexts providing immediate or delayed feedback. After training, participants were informed of a market crash that affected the performance of both companies, favoring one over the other. Across all experiments, action rates were lower in the delayed-feedback condition, and outcome revaluation had a more pronounced effect in the immediate-feedback condition. Self-reported action-outcome knowledge revealed that participants were less aware of the contingencies in the delayed condition. These findings suggest that delays in reinforcement weaken the action-outcome association critical for goal-directed control. We discuss the potential mechanisms underlying this phenomenon and its implications for understanding real-life decisions.",Psychology
741,,"Purpose: While central auditory processing disorder (CAPD) evaluations assess specific auditory skills necessary for efficient processing and understanding of complex auditory signals, many tests included in these evaluations rely heavily on language. This poses an issue for non-native English speakers, and it remains unclear whether testing these individuals in a secondary language produces an accurate clinical assessment and diagnosis. Our study aimed to determine the most appropriate language for CAPD assessment in bilingual speakers.

Method: Twenty-five Spanish-English bilingual speakers participated in this repeated measures study to assess binaural processing performance when evaluated using test materials in their native (Spanish) and secondary (English) languages. Binaural integration and separation were assessed using dichotic digits, competing words, and competing sentences. Participants completed these assessments twice—once in Spanish, once in English. Performance on the binaural tasks was compared between languages to determine if the language used for instruction and assessment impacted auditory processing performance.

Results: Performance varied by language for more challenging auditory tasks (i.e., dichotic digits, competing words) with participants performing poorer when materials were administered in English. Increasing age emphasized these language differences and revealed interaural asymmetries.

Conclusions: These findings suggest testing Spanish-English bilinguals with English materials may provide inaccurate representations of their binaural processing abilities, even when they are considered to be proficient in English. Impaired performance may more likely be attributed to language differences rather than true auditory processing deficits. Therefore, non-native English speakers should be assessed for CAPD using test materials in their native language whenever possible.",Psychology

This comment considers the revised model’s characterization of self-presence, finding a tension in its theoretical revision that propagates to its conceptualization of paranoia. It suggests that this tension precludes the explanation of paranoia as an instance of exaggerated self-presence. The phenomenon of paranoia may be better characterized as diminished self-presence in the context of heightened grip or hold on a perceptual reality that includes other minds.",Psychology
743,,"The paper proposes a multitude of deterministic hypotheses for input into the multi-scale dimensional model of social attunement and mis attunement for interpersonal psychiatry with a particular focus on autism. This paper uses basic concepts of physics motivated by the idea that the biology of the brain is impacted by the physics of the moving and interacting physical objects as well as competitive economics to outline multiple hypotheses for the development of hidden states and eco-social niche. The theory paper starts with defining cognitive granularity and leverages it to build five embodied cognition hypotheses that outline three distinct dyads with varying sensorimotor skills of action control and action perception – Resource Proxy, Doer, and Result Detection. Each of these dyads interact with the environment in physically distinct but beneficial ways leading to iterative honing of the dyads discriminating individual skills – dialects of internalization and externalization. These individual dyads further form the basis of social attunement and mis attunement - dialects of individual and the collective, which are outlined through three additional hypotheses to propose a muti-dimensional model of social attunement and two more hypotheses proposed as a model of social mis attunement. The social attunement hypothesis leverages the economic supply/demand curve and Nash equilibrium as eco-social niches to model the social attunement of the underlying dyads (Doer and Result Detection).  Social mis attunement hypotheses state that the collapse of the above eco-social equilibrium or the lack of the dyad’s sensorimotor skills to partake in the equilibrium leads to the psychiatric issues related to autism or psychosis. The above-mentioned hypotheses are proposed to be inputs to the artificial intelligence and machine learning multi-scale dimensional model.",Psychology
744,,"Social neuroscience sets out to uncover the neural mechanisms and dynamics of human sociality. Interpersonal coordination on various levels—neural, behavioural, physiological, affective, linguistic— are hallmarks of successful social communication and cooperation. However, describing these complex, interdependent dynamics has been limited by current methodological approaches, owing to a restrictive repertoire of tools and the absence of a unified, standardised methodological framework. Here, we identify information theory, the mathematical theory of communication, as a particularly well-suited conceptual framework to address this shortfall, given its appropriate sensitivity to complex dynamics, including potential nonlinearity and higher-order interactions, and its data-driven approach. Indeed, with its firm grounding in computational, cognitive, and systems neuroscience, the introduction of information-theoretic quantities and methods into social neuroscience is perhaps overdue. This Perspective presents the case for a unified information-theoretic framework to describe and model the complex dynamics of social systems whilst generating new, open research questions.",Psychology

746,,"It is not uncommon to witness individuals competing for social resources such as affection and status. Does this mean that people view social resources as inherently zero-sum—where gains for one person result in losses for another? Two preregistered studies found that US adults and 4-9-year-old US children did not view nonrival social resources (love and trust) or rival social resources (popularity and leadership) as zero-sum, both less zero-sum than material resources like stickers. Importantly, zero-sum thinking was not determined by the inherent properties of the resources but was influenced by renewability: Perceived renewability of resources predicted lower levels of zero-sum beliefs, and both social and material resources were perceived as less zero-sum when presented as renewable compared to nonrenewable. These findings shed light on the nature and origins of zero-sum beliefs, highlighting renewability as a key mechanism and a potential intervention for reducing competition and promoting cooperation.",Psychology
747,,"Given the finite computational power of the brain, it must prioritize the most urgent information from its affective inputs. Using a systems biology approach, I propose that the reticular nucleus of the thalamus performs the function of a variable-threshold gate for all parallel streams of primary affective information, which allows the conscious mind to perform work on only the most urgent threats to survival at any given time. The threshold of such a thalamic gate would be dynamic, would correlate positively with a person’s overall level of stress, and would provide an unconscious, automatic mechanism for the resolution of intrapsychic conflicts. This suggests that the primary aim of development is not to learn how to resolve intrapsychic conflicts, but rather to learn a diverse set of strategies that are sufficient to respond to the needs of every primary affective system with a high level of certainty. I also extend ideas formulated in the Solms model to re-organize psychological defenses along a continuum of the mind’s perceived entropy of its most pressing current task. I combine this organization of psychological defenses with the variable-threshold thalamic gate hypothesis (1) to suggest that projective identification is not a singular defense, (2) to simplify the etiology of borderline personality disorder, and (3) to explain the success of psychodynamic psychotherapies that focus on conscious affect.",Psychology

Guided by motivational model of belief, we expected three overarching factors: importance, certainty, and metacognitive difficulty. Using a comprehensive list of 50 political issues, we verified this structure across the three countries: the US, Poland, and India (total N = 2,838). Our predictions were largely confirmed in the US sample. However, in Poland and in India, there were two main uncorrelated factors: (1) importance &amp; certainty, and (2) metacognitive difficulty. We also found that higher importance, higher certainty, and lower metacognitive difficulty were associated with more extreme positions. However, importance was the key predictor of advocacy intentions. These findings offer a unifying framework for describing ideological beliefs regardless of their content and have implications for understanding ideological thinking, political prejudice, or cultural differences in ideology.",Psychology

Abstract
This study addresses the gender gap in mathematics achievement in Latin America, where the
difference in favor of boys is significantly greater than in developed countries. The
interactions between boys' and girls' mathematics achievement and teacher gender bias in a
context of educational inequality were analyzed. Four hundred and seventeen students (211
boys and 206 girls) from 25 level 5 and first grade groups from schools with different
socioeconomic levels participated. A questionnaire on gender beliefs was administered to
teachers and the Uruguayan Mathematics Test (PUMa) to students.
The results showed a slight overall advantage in the mathematical performance of boys, more
pronounced in first grade and significant in symbolic mathematics, especially in schools of
low socioeconomic level. In addition, a greater teacher bias in favor of boys was found to be
related to a larger gap in mathematics achievement. The main limitations were the sample
size, which restricts the generalizability of the results, and the absence of implicit
measurement tools to capture automatic beliefs of teachers. We suggest expanding the sample
and using implicit assessment methods in future research to further explore the impact of
teacher bias.",Psychology
756,,"Empirical evidence is lacking on the effectiveness of grief telephone counselling, particularly in Australia. This study addresses an important gap by evaluating the effectiveness of the Integrating Grief Program – Victoria (IGP-V), an Australian telephone-based intervention. A retrospective analysis of IGP-V session data was analysed with 197 former clients, examining change in psychological distress (Kessler 10; K10) across pre- and post-treatment time points. Psychological distress significantly decreased at a group and individual level; 48% of the participants showed a reliable reduction in their symptoms (n= 95) while 31.4% showed a change that was both reliable and clinically significant (n= 62). Further analyses examined K10 subscales: Anxiety (comprising ‘nervous’, ‘agitated’) and Depression (comprising ‘fatigue’, ‘negative affect’). Depression was significantly more prominent in the sample than Anxiety, and both Anxiety and Depression decreased over time, with a stronger reduction in depression. Of the depression subscales, fatigue was the most prominent pre- and post-treatment, while negative affect reduced the most post-treatment. A Latent Class Analysis (LCA) identified three subgroups (low, medium, and high distress) based on K10 subscales. The medium distress group demonstrated the greatest treatment responsiveness, with 41% (n = 41) showing reliable and clinically significant change. With few studies exploring the effectiveness of grief counselling in Australian populations, this research provides important preliminary evidence of IGP-V’s potential to reduce grief related psychological distress. These findings are a vital first step toward improving grief support and mental health services in Australia, with further studies set to expand on this promising preliminary data.",Psychology
757,,"The decision-making framework and computational models have been instrumental in revealing the neurocognitive processes that underlie human behaviors, significantly enhancing our understanding of the human mind. However, traditional approaches often fall short in closely mimicking real-world behaviors due to their oversimplified nature, inability to capture the dynamic aspects of the human mind, and heavy reliance on secondary (e.g., monetary) rewards that have limited ecological utility. This article summarizes the evolution and recent developments of computational approaches in understanding human cognition and decision-making, with a particular focus on addiction. We highlight the transition from conventional laboratory-based methods to innovative approaches that more effectively simulate real-world scenarios. These advanced approaches leverage state-of-the-art computational techniques to capture dynamic psychological processes, contributing to the ongoing development and advances in the field.",Psychology

761,,"When a certain option and a risky option are both described as potential gains, most people choose the certain option. However, when the same two options are described as potential losses, most people choose the risky option. This famous preference pattern is known as the risky-choice framing effect. Despite the seeming rarity of sure things and all-or-none risks in real life, surprisingly little research on this framing effect has involved options with intermediate levels of risk. In this research, we identified four types of “somewhat risky” options, combined them with each other and with certain and all-or-none options to create 15 risk comparisons in both gains and losses in each of four domains (cancer, drought, investment, and wildfire), and conducted two preregistered experiments in which we varied risk comparisons between or within participants in both student and online samples (total N = 2,586 after exclusions). We found significant framing effects in almost all risk comparisons, greatly expanding the range of decisions in which framing is relevant. In addition, we used out-of-sample predictions from 13 versions of risky-choice theories to evaluate how well those theories accounted for participants’ choices. Versions of transfer-of-attention-exchange theory (TAX) generally outperformed versions of prospect theory, fuzzy-trace theory, the priority heuristic, and other accounts, although prospect theory without loss aversion outperformed TAX and the other accounts when we used an alternate set of parameter values.",Psychology
762,,"Rhythmic auditory stimulation is a commonly used therapeutic method involving repetitive movements cued by rhythmic sounds, aiming to support movement (re-)learning as well as attentional orienting. While musical properties of the cue have been extensively studied, not much is known about the role of individual differences in cognitive and motor abilities that enable sensorimotor synchronization. In this study, 50 participants performed a finger tapping task under various conditions. Tapping was performed as a stand-alone task (single task), and simultaneously with 2-Back working memory task (dual task), to sounds with differing levels of rhythmic complexity (metronome vs. music), both having a clear, steady beat. Standardized neuropsychological tests were related to tapping timing and force in the single task and to their dual task cost (interference). Participants tapped with lower consistency in the dual task for both auditory cues. Poorer cognitive inhibition and better gross motor ability each predicted greater applied force. In contrast, participants with poorer fine motor ability also tapped with lower force. A an inverse U-shape relation emerged (but did not survive sensitivity analysis) between fine motor ability and tapping timing consistency, where both poorer and better fine motor abilities predicted higher consistency. These non-linear relationships were shown for the single and dual tasks, but not for the dual task cost. Overall, this study highlights the complex interactions of aspects of movement and cognitive abilities with sensorimotor synchronization, which is essential to many music-based interventions, and highlights the importance of the consideration of individual baseline abilities.",Psychology
763,,"Previous studies involving birds and humans have identified spatial proximity as a source of overshadowing between landmarks in navigation. In Herrera et al. (2024), subjects were trained in an open environment to find a hidden goal with reference to a cross-shaped array of four landmarks placed at various distances from it. Critically, two of the four landmarks (i.e., target landmarks) were placed at distances that were common among groups whereas the remaining two were either proximal or distal from them. Landmarks near to the goal overshadowed (i.e., competed with) learning about the further ones, and this effect disappeared in the groups trained with distal landmarks. However, neither of these studies included a control group providing a base line performance to assess the extent of competition; were the data indicative of overshadowing or facilitation of learning? Thus, we assessed whether spatial proximity determines overshadowing or facilitation between landmarks, including a control group trained with the target landmarks only. We conducted three experiments with varied training length: 6 training trials in Experiment 1 and 16 in Experiments 2 and 3. We also extended the distance of the landmarks to the goal in Experiment 3. In all experiments, we observed overshadowing in the groups trained with closer nontarget landmarks (relative to the target) but no overshadowing when the nontarget landmarks were distal from the target landmarks. Overall, these experiments reveal spatial distance is a critical determinant of overshadowing between landmarks, a finding that is consistent with domain-general theories of learning, such as a modification of Pearce’s configural model.",Psychology

In this study, we develop and validate a scale to measure racial diversity in people’s fiction reading: the Heterogenous Author Recognition Test (HeART). To validate the scale, participants completed the HeART alongside vocabulary, reading comprehension, and self-reported reading habits. Our results suggest that the HeART is a valid measure of 1) how much people read overall, and 2) the racial composition of people’s reading habits. Initial results also suggest that more diverse reading habits are associated with lower anti-Black prejudice. Together, these findings validate the HeART as a measure of the racial diversity in individuals’ long-term reading habits that may facilitate research on the relationship between habitual race-specific reading and interpersonal attitudes.",Psychology
765,,"Human faces and their representations play a key role in social interactions. Consequently, face images are widely used as stimuli across psychological research. However, most available face databases primarily represent Western, predominantly White populations, raising concerns about the generalizability of findings derived from such non-diverse stimuli sets. The current work addresses this problem by introducing the Israeli Face Database (IFD): a novel database presenting face images of real individuals from an ethnically diverse population underrepresented in psychological research on face perception—people residing in Israel. The IFD features multiple highly controlled images per face identity, presenting several facial expressions. Additionally, we provide detailed demographic data on the face identities, expression validation data rated by Israeli participants, and social norming data rated by both Israeli and U.S.-based participants. Validation data (Study 1) confirmed that the expression images in the IFD accurately convey their intended expressions. Norming data analysis (Study 2) revealed that judgments of IFD faces were broadly consistent across cultures, with notable variations in perceived typicality and perceived ethnic diversity. These results highlight the IFD's strong psychometric properties and its ability to capture nuanced cultural and individual differences in face perception. We propose that the IFD can serve as a valuable tool for diversifying stimuli in social-psychological research.",Psychology
766,,"The ability to quickly and precisely follow another person’s gaze reflects important evolutionary mechanisms that underlie social interactions, such as attention modulation and prediction of future actions. Recent studies have shown that observers utilize gazer head direction and peripheral information to execute anticipatory saccades toward gaze goals. However, how anticipatory eye movements are influenced by the presence of multiple potential gaze goals, the absence of the gazer and the relative distance between the gazer and gaze goal has not been studied.  In this work, we presented dynamic stimuli of gazers moving their heads to look at other individuals (gaze goals) in the scene and instructed observers to search for a target individual. We measured the accuracy of the first saccade end-point in locating the gaze goal. Firstly, we find that the absence of a gazer induces a significantly larger saccade error in estimating the goal location but only when the initial fixation location and the gaze goal location are far from each other (at least 9.07 dva apart). The first saccade’s amplitude and onset latency are significantly higher in gazer-present than in gazer-absent trials. Secondly, when multiple potential gaze goals were present in the visual periphery, the first saccade was directed to the individual closer to the initial fixation increasing the saccade accuracy in fixating closer gaze goals. Finally, we find that multiple potential gaze goals present in the visual periphery shorten saccade latencies and increase the frequency of anticipatory saccades executed prior to the completion of the gazer’s head movement. Taken together, our findings extend the understanding of eye movement control during gaze-following to complex and naturalistic scenarios.",Psychology
767,,"One of the biggest limitations of meta-analyses is that the information they provide can be affected by the biases of the included primary studies. To address this, evaluations of primary study risk of bias (RoB) can be performed and incorporated into the meta-analysis. However, research on this topic in clinical psychology is scarce. In this study, we examined this issue using a sample of clinical psychology meta-analyses that included RoB assessments. First, we evaluated meta-analysts’ assessment practices. Second, we summarized the RoB ratings of the primary studies included in the meta-analyses. Lastly, we examined the relationship between RoB ratings and effect sizes. We found some suboptimal practices in the assessment procedures, such as only half of the studies reporting that the assessment was conducted in duplicate. Regarding RoB ratings, the domains with the highest ratings were random sequence generation, blinding of outcome assessment, and incomplete outcome data, with about half of the primary studies rated as low RoB. The lowest ratings were found for allocation concealment and, especially, blinding of participants and personnel. Importantly, we found a positive association between the publication year of the primary studies and a lower RoB in most domains. Lastly, performing our own re-analysis, we found an association between RoB and effect sizes, which contrasts with the results of the analyses reported in the meta-analyses that combined those studies. We recommend caution when interpreting a lack of modulation of effect sizes in meta-analyses, as they may not have sufficient statistical power for moderator analyses.",Psychology
768,,"We investigated the interactions between category structure, supervision, and the ability to selectively attend in category learning. To examine selective attention, we compared human adults and pigeons in a category learning task, where we manipulated the category structure (dense vs. sparse) and the level of supervision (low vs. high). Humans, who have a more advanced ability to attend selectively, showed faster learning and better generalization overall. Both species showed a benefit for the category structures that had multiple category-relevant dimensions (i.e., dense categories). In addition, there was a benefit of supervision that was particularly strong in learning the sparse categories. Finally, attention was optimized to the category-relevant dimension in the sparse category only in human adults. Subsequent computational simulation of the data indicates that these patterns are well explained by a parameter that controls the ability to flexibly switch attention to category-relevant dimensions.",Psychology
769,,"The uncertainty monitoring account proposes that during reasoning, people may generate several intuitive responses, each contributing to an overall uncertainty parameter that will trigger conscious deliberation if it becomes high enough. In two experiments (total N = 186), we test this account by utilising methods and theory of metacognition – which also describes a second-order process that regulates the operation of first-order cognition. We analyse which internal cues influence confidence and accuracy, and how the consistency of cues influences confidence, accuracy, and participants changing their answers. Confidence judgements were not sensitive to belief-logic conflict when other cues were accounted for, contrary to prior research. Instead, overall cue consistency was more important for determining confidence and response changes. We discuss the implications of these findings in the context of current dual process accounts of reasoning.",Psychology
770,,"With financial scams representing a growing economic burden globally, it is becoming increasingly important to understand why certain individuals are more vulnerable to them. Prior research has suggested intelligence, cognitive reflection, financial literacy, and grandiose narcissism to predict susceptibility to financial scams. However, it remains to be determined whether these factors uniquely predict scam-susceptibility, and whether cognitive reflection and/or financial literacy (grandiose narcissism) mediate (suppresses) any of the hypothesised associations. University students (N = 489) completed a 12-item scam-susceptibility assessment, several intelligence tests, a cognitive reflection test, a financial literacy test, and the narcissistic admiration and rivalry questionnaire. Negative correlations between all three cognitive factors and susceptibility to financial scams were observed. However, based on a structural equation model, only financial literacy uniquely predicted scam-susceptibility, controlling for the other factors, implying a mediating effect. This suggests that financial education programs may be beneficial for young adults in reducing scam-susceptibility.",Psychology
771,,"Cultural differences in cognition, including visual perception and long-term memory, are influenced by the spatial scale of visual stimuli. The impact of culture varies depending on whether the stimuli are presented at large or small spatial scale. We tested North American and East Asian young adults to determine whether such cultural differences extend to short-term memory. Test materials were images of natural and constructed scenes whose spatial structure could be altered by low-pass ﬁltering. Several seconds after briefly viewing a target scene, a subject saw three versions of that scene: the target itself and two variants whose low-pass ﬁltering differed from the target. From these three, the subject selected the image identical to the target. The two groups did not differ in overall recognition accuracy but did in the way they mistook non-matching images for certain targets.  Specifically, North American subjects made signiﬁcantly fewer errors in matching images whose high-frequency content was intact, providing evidence that cultural differences in prioritization of high spatial frequency information extend to short-term memory. Across both groups, subjects were highly accurate at recognizing images that retained all or most of their high-spatial frequency content and were highly sensitive to different levels of spatial filtering. These findings show that visual memory has sufficient fidelity to support fine discrimination of variation in spatial frequency.",Psychology

We evaluate our approach by crowdsourcing labels for medical image diagnostic tasks using two different crowdsourcing platforms across two experiments. In Experiment 1, we collect subjective probability judgments from novice annotators through Amazon Mechanical Turk and, in Experiment 2, we collect subjective probability judgments and binary classifications from skilled annotators though DiagnosUs, a crowdsourcing platform specializing in medical and scientific data annotation.

Our results suggest that cognitive-inspired data engineering offers a promising avenue to improve the quality of crowdsourced datasets.",Psychology
773,,"This study explores the use of natural language processing to automate the evaluation of collaborative group engagement in collaborative learning settings. We evaluated two approaches involving large-language models (LLMs) and a set of interpretable linguistic markers to predict the four dimensions---behavioral, social, cognitive, and conceptual-to-consequential engagement---of the quality of collaborative group engagement (QCGE) model. Analyzing conversation transcripts from three-person student groups engaged in a computer-supported collaborative design task produced four major findings. First, natural language processing successfully predicted out-of-sample about 10\% of variance in collaborative engagement, suggesting that assessment can be automated. Second, interpretable linguistic markers explained more of this variance than did ratings from an intransparent LLM. Third, the best linguistic markers were not specifically related to any individual dimension of QCGE, suggesting a common core of collaborative engagement. Fourth, the QCGE's manual rating model was limited due to its lack of granularity and insensitivity to natural variability in engagement. Overall, our analysis demonstrates both how natural language processing approaches can be leveraged to successfully automate the assessment of collaborative engagement and how these approaches can reveal key insights into the drivers of collaborative engagement.",Psychology
774,,"This study examines the relationship between visual working memory (VWM) and object recognition, focusing on category expertise (faces vs. houses) and processing strategies (featural vs. configural) under varying cognitive loads. Participants performed a VWM task with numerical sequences and an object recognition task manipulating featural and configural attributes. Results indicated a strong relationship between VWM performance and configural processing of houses, a non-expert category, in high-load conditions, suggesting greater demands of this task on general VWM resources. Conversely, faces-an expert category-appeared to rely less on VWM because of specialized holistic processing mechanisms. Featural processing of non-expert categories was also found to require fewer VWM resources. These findings highlight how expertise and processing strategies contribute to VWM, where non-expert categories rely more on the general mechanisms and the expert categories exploit domain-specific efficiencies to alleviate cognitive load.",Psychology
775,,"It is becoming increasingly common in the psychology and neuroscience literature to use Bayes factors to provide evidence in favor of the null hypothesis. The most common approach reports a Bayes factor that compares the null hypothesis to a “default” alternative. This approach can show that the data is more likely to have been generated under the null hypothesis than under the specific alternative tested, but it cannot provide evidence for the absence of an effect. In fact, analyses using “default” alternatives can return evidence in favor of the null hypothesis when the data is consistent with medium to large effects. I show that common interpretations of these Bayes factor analyses are misleading, and I provide examples and simulations that help to understand what a Bayes factor in favor of the null does and does not tell us. I argue that Bayes factors have no special ability to help us understand null effects when compared to frequentist methods such as equivalence testing and confidence intervals.",Psychology

The addition of sections for documenting recording and playback conditions further enhances replicability and communication among practitioners. This commentary also identifies potential limitations, such as the exact definition of the right endpoint on the visual analog scale (VAS), and could benefit from a more comprehensive definition of resonance. Overall, the CAPE-Vr update represents a significant advancement in achieving greater usability, consistency, and clarity in perceptual voice assessment. The revised instrument is poised to improve diagnostic precision, facilitate more robust research, and support the development of cross-cultural adaptations, ensuring its continued role as a cornerstone in voice evaluation.",Psychology
777,,"DMT reliably induces profound experiences of immersion in other worlds and encounters with seemingly autonomous presences, yet the lived qualities and unfolding of these experiences remain poorly understood. Using micro-phenomenological interviews with twenty-three healthy participants who received DMT during fMRI scanning, this study explores how these experiences arise and develop in awareness. Micro-phenomenological analysis reveals rich dimensions of immersive experience - from multisensory engagement to radical reconfigurations of self and world - and illuminates the varied ways presences can be seen, felt, or otherwise sensed. Rather than focusing on specific content, we follow the micro-phenomenological method to identify the structural features and temporal dynamics that characterise the rich subjective landscape of DMT experience. The findings extend beyond traditional constructs like 'ego dissolution' or 'mystical experience' to reveal how immersion and presence phenomena emerge through specific dimensions, particularly the layering of sensory effects, and subsequent layering of spatial, self-related, and social effects. This detailed phenomenological mapping advances our understanding of both DMT's effects and the architecture of conscious experience, while demonstrating the value of systematic first-person methods for studying profound alterations of consciousness. The findings invite comparative analysis with other transformations of consciousness, such as meditation and lucid dreaming, and especially with presence phenomena observed across different experiential contexts such as lab-induced presence hallucinations, and Parkinson’s disease.",Psychology
778,,"Background
Empathy is an early-appearing, socioemotional capacity with emotional and cognitive components that develop from infancy onward. An imbalance between these components, termed empathic disequilibrium, is related to socioemotional difficulties in adulthood. However, the developmental trajectory of empathic disequilibrium has not been characterized, nor do we know if changes in empathic disequilibrium are associated with socioemotional difficulties. This study investigated developmental change in empathic disequilibrium in children aged 3 to 12 years and its associations with socioemotional outcomes.
Methods
303 children from the general population were assessed at three time points, each four months apart. Well-validated parent-reported measures of cognitive and emotional empathy, as well as socioemotional outcomes, including conduct problems, emotional difficulties, callous-unemotional traits, and prosocial behavior, were analyzed. Considering both within and between participant variability in age, we characterized typical empathic disequilibrium development. Then, we examined whether socioemotional strengths and difficulties at the last time point moderated this trajectory.
Results
Empathic disequilibrium followed a developmental pattern shifting from emotional empathy dominance at age 3 years to equilibrium typically reached between ages 4.7 and 6.9. After this period, a trend toward cognitive empathy dominance emerged, which declined during early adolescence, following a non-linear pattern. Children with socioemotional difficulties at the final measurement point showed distinct developmental patterns of empathic disequilibrium. Specifically, children with high emotional problems, callous-unemotional traits, and low prosocial behavior were less likely to achieve empathic equilibrium by age 12, with those showing high conduct problems tending to reach equilibrium later than their peers.
Conclusions
This study illustrates how empathic disequilibrium develops from early childhood to early adolescence and how variations in this developmental path are associated with different socioemotional outcomes. These findings suggest that tracking empathic disequilibrium could provide insights for identifying children who may benefit from tailored intervention.",Psychology
779,,"Sleep-related Breathing Disorders (SRBD) are one of the most 
common sleep disorders. Patients suffer from repetitions of complete stops 
(apneas) or partial reductions (hypopneas) in respiratory flow during sleep. The 
standard method for the diagnosis of sleep apnea is the attended cardiorespiratory 
polysomnography (PSG). However, this method is expensive, and the extensive 
recording equipment can have a significant impact on sleep quality, falsifying the 
results. This work aims to investigate and validate a simplified automated system 
that uses only a tracheal sound (TS) sensor. A signal processing-based algorithm 
was implemented to detect respiratory events and thus estimate the Apnea 
Hypopnea Index (AHI). For validation, 13 full-night PSG recordings were 
analyzed. The present method consists of using only TS for respiratory event 
detection. Considering PSG as a gold standard reference, the developed approach 
reached the following results: For apnea detection, positive predictive value 
(PPV) reached 82%, and the sensitivity was 90%. For hypopnea detection, PPV 
reached 40%, and the sensitivity was 58%. For AHI estimation, 93%accuracy 
was achieved. In conclusion, we worked on a new, simpler approach than PSG, 
yet very promising, to reliably detect apnea and estimate the AHI score. 
However, hypopnoea detection still needs more future improvements.",Psychology
780,,"This study describes the development and validation of ROAR Palabra, a novel Spanish lexical decision task designed for use with both Spanish-speaking children and Spanish-English bilinguals. This self-administered task requires students to decide whether a string of letters presented on the screen is a real word in Spanish. While there is evidence that scores on English lexical decision tasks are highly predictive of performance on conventional (time- and resource-intensive) word reading assessments in English (Yeatman et al., 2021), we explore whether this holds in Spanish, which has a much more transparent orthography. The specific goals are (i) to create a linguistically fair task and an item-response theory model for it and (ii) to evaluate whether such task can serve as a reliable proxy for conventional word reading measures, offering a quick and easy-to-administer tool for assessing reading skills across linguistic and cultural contexts. Results demonstrated strong correlations between performance on ROAR Palabra and standardized word reading assessments such as the Woodcock-Muñoz Batería IV, suggesting its effectiveness as a substitute measure. Notably, the task was sensitive to differences in language proficiency across both monolingual and multilingual groups, reflecting expected developmental and environmental influences. While not designed for the comparisons between monolingual and multilingual populations, the findings underscore the potential of this task as a versatile and culturally adaptable tool for reading assessments in different Spanish-speaking and bilingual contexts.",Psychology
781,,"Everyday behavior, like grocery shopping, often includes search for multiple objects of one kind. Such “visual foraging” tasks have recently received more attention in vision science. However, although object search is usually performed for object interaction, only few studies have been conducted with real objects. When interacting with real-world objects, factors such as the type of interaction and its precision requirements are likely to affect object selection. When high precision is required, actions are performed more carefully (e.g., with lower speed and a longer deceleration phase). In addition, action contexts—such as the type or endpoint of movements—affect adaptive movement planning and action parameters, including grasp point selection and movement speed. To investigate such influences in interactive real-world visual foraging, we asked participants to pick and place LEGO bricks defined by color and varied the precision requirements with different placing instructions. Movement analysis revealed that participants preferred nearby objects but also prioritized those beneficial to the task, such as larger objects when instructed to create a pile. This demonstrates that participants planned reach movements by balancing immediate movement costs with future precision demands. Our results emphasize that task and action context, such as placing requirements or the environmental layout, need to be considered for understanding visual selection in real-world situations.",Psychology
782,,"Humans can learn about the outcomes of available choice alternatives via their own choices, but also by observing others choosing. As agents learn, they should become more confident in knowing the best alternative. However, here we show that such confidence is lower in situations where observational learning typically happens, compared to contexts of predominant individual learning. Our first experiment let participants decide between learning by choosing between reward alternatives and by observing another agent’s choices. Introducing contexts with frequent reward loss made participants both observe more and report lower confidence in knowing which alternative delivered higher reward, despite more frequent choices of this better alternative. To disentangle whether reduced confidence was due to frequent losses or to more observation, we conducted two follow-up experiments where reward and choice agency were manipulated independently. Both factors were found to independently reduce confidence. Our results illustrate how confidence based on the alternatives’ value is reduced by the negative outcomes that often accompany observation, and by an agency component derived from fewer choices being made, thus offering a multifactorial account of the formation of confidence during observational learning.",Psychology
783,,"Acetaminophen (paracetamol) can blunt various emotional states and evaluations, seemingly through the same mechanisms by which it dulls the affective component of physical pain. However, most of this work has used self-report or neural measures, with more limited investigations into behavioral effects of blunting emotions pharmacologically. As emotions influence behavior in ways that are adaptive on average, interfering with them might lead to unwanted behavioral changes. For example, disrupting the affective processing of a scary situation might lead individuals to react to it less cautiously. 260 participants were given either 1000 mg of acetaminophen or placebo capsules prior to a frightening virtual reality plank walk at extreme heights. Compared to the placebo group, those on acetaminophen stepped onto the plank sooner, walked across it faster, and had lower heart rates. These findings suggest that acetaminophen might reduce cautious behaviors in dangerous situations, but could also be potentially useful in clinical settings where overly cautious and avoidant behaviors are disproportionate to the danger posed.",Psychology
784,,"Rules are essential for the successful coordination of large-scale societies, with official, codified rules (e.g., laws) proscribing behaviors for everyone in their jurisdiction. These rules ostensibly provide a clear signal about what is permitted or prohibited, making it straightforward to identify when they have been broken. However, signals from descriptive norms, moral prohibition, and (lack of) legitimacy of enforcement can sometimes provide conflicting accounts of what behaviors really violate rules, possibly shaping whether someone thinks a rule has been broken at all. Across three experiments (N = 2,262), we explored how each of these signals affect rule concept judgments. In Study 1, we used a variety of real rules in the US and found that all four signals—descriptive norms, codification, moral wrongness, and legitimacy of punishment—are associated with judgments of whether a rule was broken, but to varying degrees. Study 2 replicated these findings in a preregistered study. Study 3 experimentally manipulated these four signals in a novel context using a conjoint design. We found that codification and moral wrongness most strongly influence rule concepts. Together, these findings suggest that judgments about what constitutes a rule are shaped by the integration of multiple distinct signals, including but not limited to the literal codification of the rule itself.",Psychology
785,,"Geometry is at the foundation of many of humanity’s greatest cultural achievements, from art and architecture to science and technology. This chapter explores the origins of humans’ unique capacity for geometry by describing the early emerging geometric sensitivities of human infants. Initially, infants show limited sensitivities to the geometry of 2D visual forms, discriminating the relative lengths of a form’s parts but not the angles at which those parts meet, consistent with the hypothesis that infants differentiate forms by their shape skeletons. Nevertheless, infants’ sensitivities to the geometry of 2D visual forms may become increasingly abstract with their acquisition of natural language, paralleling the increased geometric abstraction that underlies toddlers’ developing 3D object recognition and categorization. Such development may ultimately support informal learning of the foundational geometric building blocks of formal geometry, like those found in Euclid’s Elements, with concepts like parallelism, perpendicularity, and angle, and may thus set the stage for formal learning of geometry in school.",Psychology
786,,"Background: Studies have shown that engaging in playful social activities offers valuable opportunities for development throughout one's lifespan and are associated with enhanced physical and psychological well-being in older age. However, research that examined playful interactions in the online setting is still scarce. The aim of the present study was to assess the impact of online playful interaction on emotional, social, and cognitive functions among the older population.
Methods: Thirty-four older adults (aged 74–91, Mage=85) participated in a within-group study design. Participants took part in two 15-minute sessions of playful interaction and a control condition— personal conversation and an exercise class. Cognitive and subjective measures were taken before and after the sessions to assess socio-emotional and attentional functions.
Findings: A significant interaction (Time X Type of Activity) was found, validating the playful interaction's positive effect on increasing Digit Span score. A significant increase was also found in the social measures (closeness and affiliation) following the playful interaction but not following the control condition. There was no significant interaction for the Stroop or for positive and negative affect.   
Conclusions: A short and focused online playful interaction with old-older adults had significant effects on cognitive and social functioning, even in an online platform.
Implications: Healthcare providers working with older individuals can consider incorporating online playful activities into their daily routines to enhance cognitive functioning and social connectedness.",Psychology
787,,"Herbal products, many scientifically unsupported, are a popular means of improving health. Given the uncritical media coverage of herbal remedies that previous research documents, we aimed to develop an effective tool to promote their more critical consumption. We developed an inoculation-based intervention -  a random news generator that reveals the persuasive strategies commonly used by the media: appeals to nature, tradition, availability, and pseudoscientific jargon. We tested the effectiveness of the intervention across three preregistered experimental studies. In a classical laboratory setting (N = 243), we demonstrated the effectiveness of active inoculation  - a guided use of the random news generator which motivated participants to refute media strategies; the effects persisted ten days after the intervention. Based on these findings, we developed a self-standing online intervention and tested it with a sample of students (N = 439) and a community sample (N = 452). The intervention led to a more critical evaluation of a fictive herbal product, an unrelated alternative practice, as well as reduced intentions to use a broader range of herbs to improve health and general trust in traditional, complementary, and alternative medicine industry. The inoculation was more efficient in reducing trust among participants with an intuitive thinking style who endorse magical health and extra-sensory perception beliefs, thus, among participants whose profile is predictive of greater use of herbal remedies. The developed tool has a range of possible applications within different stakeholder groups.",Psychology
788,,"Based on findings from analyses with cross-lagged panel models, Rodeiro et al. (2025) concluded that physical inactivity had an effect on mental disorders mediated by loneliness. However, contrary to convention, Rodeiro et al. did not seem to adjust for the predictor (i.e., initial physical inactivity) when estimating the effect of the mediator (i.e., loneliness) on the outcome (i.e., subsequent mental disorders) or to estimate the statistical significance of the mediated effect. Here, we simulated data to resemble the data used by Rodeiro et al. A longitudinal mediation model showed no statistically significant mediated (via loneliness) or total effect of initial physical inactivity on subsequent mental disorders. Consequently, the conclusions by Rodeiro et al. appear not to be supported by their own data.",Psychology
789,,"In a visual intruder task, regular quadrilaterals such as squares and rectangles are easier to process than matched shapes devoid of parallelism, symmetry or right-angles. This geometric regularity effect was found in various human groups, including preschoolers and uneducated adults, but not in non-human primates. It was proposed to reflect a fundamental ability to combine discrete geometric features into structured representations of geometric shapes using an abstract amodal language-of-thought (LoT) that also supports the acquisition of symbolic drawing and formal mathematics. Here, we tested a prediction of this hypothesis: blind participants should have the same intuitions of geometric regularity as sighted ones. To evaluate this prediction, congenitally blind and sighted but blindfolded adults underwent a tactile version of the visual quadrilateral intruder task. Among six tactile shapes, five of which were identical up to small size and rotation changes, participants were asked to identify a deviant shape defined by a fixed displacement of a single vertex, and to rate their confidence in their response. Both variables revealed a geometric regularity effect in both groups, correlated with previous results in the visual domain. Furthermore, a symbolic LoT model was a better predictor of tactile performance than a visual CNN model in blind participants. Thus, the geometric regularity effect develops in the absence of vision.",Psychology
790,,"School curricula guide the daily learning activities of millions of students. They embody the understanding of the education experts who designed them of how to organize the knowledge that students should acquire in a way that is optimal for learning. This can be viewed as a learning 'theory' which is, nevertheless, rarely put to the test. Here, we model a data set obtained from a Computer-Based Formative Assessment system used by thousands of students. The student-item response matrix is highly sparse and admits a natural representation as a bipartite graph, in which nodes stand for students or items and an edge between a student and an item represents a response of the student to that item. To predict unobserved edge labels (correct/incorrect responses) we resort to a graph neural network (GNN), a machine learning method for graph-structured data. Nodes and edges are represented as multidimensional embeddings. After fitting the model, the learned item embeddings reflect properties of the curriculum, such as item difficulty and the structure of school subject domains and competences. Simulations show that the GNN is particularly advantageous over a classical model when group patterns are present in the connections between students and items, such that students from a particular group have a higher probability of successfully answering items from a specific set. In sum, important aspects of the structure of the school curriculum are reflected in response patterns from educational assessments and can be partially retrieved by our graph-based neural model.",Psychology

This study aimed to develop and validate a brief version of the Prueba Uruguaya de Matemática (Uruguayan Mathematics Test, PUMa), a digital tool to assess mathematical abilities in children aged 5 to 6. The test comprises both symbolic and non-symbolic dimensions, including tasks as approximate number system, counting, numerical ordering (forward and backward), math fluency, composition and decomposition of numbers, and transcoding auditory-verbal stimuli into Arabic-visual symbols. Using a sample of 443 participants and applying parametric and non-parametric models within the framework of Item Response Theory (IRT), along with correlations with TEMA-3, we generated preliminary evidence that the brief version retained both precision and validity. The resulting brief test, consisting of nearly half the original items, achieved a balanced representation of symbolic and non-symbolic tasks. These findings highlight the efficiency of digital tools for real-time data collection and their potential to enable scalable early interventions. Such advancements support personalized educational strategies, fostering cognitive and academic growth from an early age.",Psychology
792,,"Math self-efficacy and test anxiety represent key aspects of motivation that play a
crucial role in student learning. Whilst prior research has established their significance, they are often studied separately in relation to performance and the influence of different teaching approaches on their dynamics is often ignored. In this study we examined: (i) the longitudinal relationships between math self-efficacy, test anxiety, and test performance, and (ii) whether these relationships differ between two teaching conditions (co-teaching vs. solo-teaching). The participants included 146 sixth-grade students in Finland: 70 students in co- taught mathematics classes (taught by three co-teacher dyads) and 76 students in solo-taught classes. Students completed measures of math task-related self-efficacy and test anxiety at the beginning and at the end of the school year. The data also included pre- and post-measures of mathematics test performances. Cross-lagged panel modeling was used to analyse the data. No reciprocal predictions were found between self-efficacy and test anxiety. Prior math performance predicted only initial test anxiety and both initial and later self-efficacy, which in turn predicted later performance. Teaching condition did not predict either motivation or performance. These findings emphasize the importance of fostering self-efficacy to enhance math performance. The absence of reciprocal effects between test anxiety and self-efficacy suggests a more complex relationship, warranting further research. Additionally, co-teaching alone may not directly influence these motivational dynamics, underscoring the need for a more tailored support to promote student learning in mathematics.",Psychology
793,,"Large language models (LLMs), or models which generate human like responses to people’s queries, are growing in popularity and may be an additional tool to access information related to sexual communication—including sexual consent and refusals. However, it remains unclear whether LLMs can identify sexual communication in hypothetical situations and how this influences their understanding of whether an encounter could be consensual, despite the importance of this capability as these tools become increasingly integrated into the sexual health field. Our study provided four different LLMs a series of seven sexual scenarios where sexual communication and context was manipulated. The models were asked to evaluate if an experience was consensual based on communication cues and context and explain why. We then compared the responses from the LLMs with eight experts in gender-based violence. When scenarios depicted clear and verbal consent or refusal communication, LLMs were consistently able to identify if the experience was consensual and matched with the experts. Experts and LLMs disagreed on when intoxication presented challenges for sexual communication and understandings of consensual sexual experiences. Our results suggest LLMs may struggle in their interpretation of complex, nuanced scenarios which require improvement to align more closely with expert judgment. Future research should focus on enhancing LLM training to better handle the subtleties of human behavior and context during instances of sexual communication.",Psychology

This scoping review examines the state of mental health research within esports, categorising findings using Keyes's dual continua model of mental health. Fifty-four studies were included, predominantly cross-sectional and involving male participants (90%). Results reveal a complex interplay between mental well-being, such as intrinsic motivation, self-efficacy, and psychosocial skills, and mental ill-health, including anxiety (82% prevalence in elite players), burnout, and gaming addiction. Notably, 68.6% of elite players lacked access to mental health support. Despite recent growth in research, significant gaps remain, including methodological inconsistencies, a lack of longitudinal and intervention studies, and limited inclusion of diverse populations. The review underscores the need for standardised measurement tools, gender-balanced samples, and tailored mental health frameworks to address the unique pressures of esports, such as performance demands, digital toxicity, and irregular schedules. Future research may consider prioritising the development of evidence-based interventions and exploring the efficacy of organisational policies in fostering player well-being.

799,,"Importance: Early regulatory problems (excessive crying, sleeping, or feeding difficulties) may be the starting point of a childhood dysregulation trajectory leading to psychiatric problems. One contributing factor to the development of regulatory problems could be parental psychological distress.

Objective: To explore whether the timing of psychological distress (i.e., before, during, or after pregnancy) matters for the likelihood of regulatory problems, and to explore if these effects differ between maternal and paternal psychological distress.

Design, Setting, Participants: We used data from the UK Household Longitudinal Study, which is a stratified random sample of UK households in 2009, with additional ethnic minority boost samples. The sample included 1,280 parents from waves 3 to 13 (2011-2012 to 2021-2022).

Exposures: In the waves (years) before and after the infant was born, both mothers and fathers reported on their psychological distress using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire.

Main Outcomes and Measures: Mothers reported on their children’s regulatory problems in the first year of life. Pooled probit regressions were estimated individually for multiple regulatory problems and each regulatory problem controlling for a range of covariates.

Results: Parental psychological distress before or during pregnancy did not predict the development of multiple regulatory problems. However, children were 3.7 percentage points more likely to experience multiple regulatory problems if their mothers had psychological in the postnatal period. There was also an association between mother’s psychological distress during pregnancy and feeding problems (3.6 percentage points), and in the postnatal period with crying (5.4 percentage points) and sleeping problems (8.6 percentage points). In contrast, father’s psychological distress before or during pregnancy had no impact on the development of early regulatory problems. However, father’s psychological distress in the postnatal period was associated with 4 percentage point increased likelihood of crying problems.

Conclusions and Relevance: While maternal psychological distress during pregnancy had some association with specific regulatory problems, the postnatal period was the most critical time for both mothers and fathers in influencing children's regulatory problems. These findings emphasize the importance of addressing parental psychological well-being, especially after childbirth, to potentially reduce the risk of early childhood dysregulation and subsequent psychiatric issues.

800,,"This study proposes an approach to describing personality dynamics through mathematical modelling of introversion, extroversion, and ambiversion processes. Introversion is interpreted as a recursive process characterized by deep self-awareness and inner reflection; extroversion is presented as an iterative process of accumulating and processing external stimuli; and ambiversion is considered transitivity, integrating the interaction of these two opposing processes. The developed model is based on principles of complex systems theory, nonlinear dynamics, and synergetics, enabling the perception of personality as an adaptive and multilayered system.
	The results include analytical equations describing the interaction of internal and external factors. Parameters regulating personality dynamics, such as sensitivity coefficients, weighting factors of stimuli, and synergy parameters, are also explored.
	The practical significance of the proposed model lies in its application in psychotherapy, education, personnel management, and other areas where it is necessary to consider personality traits and their dynamics. The model provides new opportunities for diagnosing, forecasting, and correcting personality changes, enhancing methods of working with individuals.
	The findings open some prospects for quantitative personality analysis, providing a theoretical understanding of its structure and dynamics. They also create a foundation for further interdisciplinary research in psychology, the cognitive sciences, and social systems.
	Specifically, the formalization considered in the context of program algorithms allows for the creation of functional procedures for AI and robots with differentiated psychological archetypes (introvert robots, extrovert robots, and ambivert robots).",Psychology
801,,"We present two new illusions that challenges our understanding of size and shape constancy, with implications for how we should think about feedback to the primary visual cortex (V1), the perception/cognition distinction, and the neural correlates of visual experience. Size constancy is traditionally thought to affect the perceived angular (2D) size of objects (Murray et al., 2006, Nat. Neurosci. 9 429-434). Indeed, observers are often surprised to find that size constancy stimuli are the same size in image pixels. This affect is now typically attributed to feedback to the primary visual cortex (V1) (Ni et al., 2015, Curr. Biol., 24(14) 1653-1658). A similar claim has been made about shape constancy (Thouless, 1931, Brit. J. Psych., 21 339-359). However, if size and shape constancy really do affect perceived angular (2D) size, then any rectangular frame placed in the same 2D region of the image should also be equally distorted. However, this is not what we find. Instead, pictorial size constancy, stereo size constancy, and stereo shape constancy all persist without distorting the bounding boxes placed around them. This leads us to four conclusions: First, size and shape constancy do not affect our visual experience (the perceived angular size of objects), but merely our judgment of their perceived angular size. Second, size and shape constancy become important paradigms for understanding just how low-level, and automatic, involuntary, and resistant to revision, ‘cognition’ can be. It also provides a clear demonstration of how ‘cognition’ can be mistaken for ‘perception’. Third, since size constancy is thought to rely on feedback processing to the Primary Visual Cortex (V1), we conclude that top-down processing to V1 is ‘cognitive’ rather than ‘perceptual’ (Linton, 2021, Neurosci. Conscious., 2 niab017). Fourth, this suggests that feedforward (rather than feedback) V1 must be the site for the neural correlates of visual experience.",Psychology
802,,"We present two new versions of the Hollow Face Illusion that challenge our understanding of depth cue integration. Traditional accounts of depth cue integration operate at the level of visual experience. On this account, perspective or shading can cancel out (or even invert) perceived stereo depth. By contrast, Linton (2017), Ch.2, argues that depth cue integration is merely ‘cognitive’, leaving our visual experience of stereo depth intact. The strongest challenge to Linton’s account is the ‘Hollow Face Illusion’, where shape from shading appears to invert stereo depth. Here, we argue that perceived depth is not inverted in the ‘Hollow Face Illusion’. 1. Un-Hollow Face Illusion: The hollow of the ‘Hollow Face Illusion’ is space that physically exists (mask is concave), and yet is impossible so far as the illusion is concerned (illusion is convex). When we fill this concave hollow space with 3D objects (balls, rods, protruding nose) that are inconsistent with the illusion, we experience the illusory motion (which persists) as occurring on a concave surface behind the 3D objects. (Some experience this concavity without the additional objects). 2. Morphing Face Illusion: If we attach small balls to the tip of the nose, base of the nose, and cheek, and morph from a protruding face to a hollow face and back again, the ordinal depth between these three points is seen as switching veridically. Our explanation for the ‘Hollow Face Illusion’ is therefore ‘cognitive’: whilst we might be fooled by the ‘Hollow Face Illusion’, our visual system is not.",Psychology

Key metrics, including sleep onset latency, total sleep duration, deep sleep duration, heart rate, and mood, were assessed. The key metrics were tracked using the EEG wearable Frenz Brainband, which provides comparable accuracy to gold-standard polysomnography (PSG), alongside qualitative surveys completed each morning after waking.
Findings: The results reveal that weighted blankets, such as Baloo Living, used alone or in combination with CBT-i, can improve sleep quality, morning mood, and feelings of mental and physical recovery.",Psychology
805,,"We present two new illusions that challenges our understanding of size and shape constancy, with implications for how we should think about feedback to the primary visual cortex (V1), the perception/cognition distinction, and the neural correlates of visual experience. Size constancy is traditionally thought to affect the perceived angular (2D) size of objects (Murray et al., 2006, Nat. Neurosci. 9 429-434). Indeed, observers are often surprised to find that size constancy stimuli are the same size in image pixels. This affect is now typically attributed to feedback to the primary visual cortex (V1) (Ni et al., 2015, Curr. Biol., 24(14) 1653-1658). A similar claim has been made about shape constancy (Thouless, 1931, Brit. J. Psych., 21 339-359). However, if size and shape constancy really do affect perceived angular (2D) size, then any rectangular frame placed in the same 2D region of the image should also be equally distorted. However, this is not what we find. Instead, pictorial size constancy, stereo size constancy, and stereo shape constancy all persist without distorting the bounding boxes placed around them. This leads us to four conclusions: First, size and shape constancy do not affect our visual experience (the perceived angular size of objects), but merely our judgment of their perceived angular size. Second, size and shape constancy become important paradigms for understanding just how low-level, and automatic, involuntary, and resistant to revision, ‘cognition’ can be. It also provides a clear demonstration of how ‘cognition’ can be mistaken for ‘perception’. Third, since size constancy is thought to rely on feedback processing to the Primary Visual Cortex (V1), we conclude that top-down processing to V1 is ‘cognitive’ rather than ‘perceptual’ (Linton, 2021, Neurosci. Conscious., 2 niab017). Fourth, this suggests that feedforward (rather than feedback) V1 must be the site for the neural correlates of visual experience.",Psychology
806,,"Humans flexibly allocate attention depending on the given context. The dominant view posits that attention is guided by spatial and temporal sensory contextual cues that directly specify the target location. In real-world scenarios, however, such contextual cues are not always accessible, posing a problem for identifying the current context.  Here, using a visual search paradigm combined with eye movement measurement, we show that humans also rely on the history of the previous context to infer the most probable context for guiding attention proactively. Participants searched for a visual target among the distractors. On one side of the display, targets were consistently associated with a particular fixed distractor configuration (Repeated condition), while on the other side, targets appeared with non-repeated, novel configurations (Novel condition). The Repeated condition represented a highly probable context, while the Novel condition represented rare contexts. Regardless of the current condition, participants’ initial saccade was biased toward the target direction of the Repeated condition, showing attentional guidance toward the location indicated by the most encountered context. Importantly, this attentional bias already existed before the onset of the search display, indicating the proactive use of contextual history to guide attention. We confirm that the probability of the target location or the movement parameters to report the target could not explain this context-history bias. Our study shows that, together with the sensory cue-based context detection mechanism, the context-history is also proactively used to robustly guide attention in the yet-unknown forthcoming context.",Psychology

Here, we investigated how place dependency, place identity, research competencies, empathy for wildlife, ecological knowledge – all components of environmental literacy using stepwise regression were influenced by social and environmental neighbourhood characteristics in youth residing in the Detroit metropolitan area. While distance to park, road density, and impervious surface affected environmental literacy, social variables such as education attainment and housing burden were most important. Because environmental literacy is crucial to growing advocacy and promoting pro-environmental behaviour understanding drivers that influence attitudes towards nature has ramifications for securing both an inclusive STEM workforce and sustainable future.",Psychology
808,,"We use nationally representative longitudinal data from 46,377 New Zealanders (2018–2023) to estimate the causal effects of religious service attendance on multiple dimensions of well-being. We compare two hypothetical four-year scenarios: (a) everyone attends services at least four times per month, and (b) no one attends. We adjust for baseline covariates measured before these interventions, including baseline service attendance and baseline measurements of multi-dimensional well-being. We also adjust for time-varying counfounders such as employment, disability, relationships, and parenting. We assess outcomes in the year following these sequential treatment regimes. Using cross-validation and doubly robust machine-learning estimators, we find that regular attendance increases a sense of meaning and purpose, enhances gratitude, and, somewhat unexpectedly, improves sexual satisfaction. Effects on mental health are modest, and effects on biological health and social well-being are negligible or small. In a mostly secular population, attending religious services modestly boosts meaning, gratitude, and sexual satisfaction, and more strongly increases a sense of purpose. Beyond these gains, religious attendance yields few other measurable benefits to health and well-being.",Psychology
809,,"As the field of computational cognitive neuroscience continues to expand and generate new theories, there is a growing need for more advanced methods to test the hypothesis of brain-behavior relationships. Recent progress in Bayesian cognitive modeling has enabled the combination of neural and behavioral models into a single unifying framework. However, these approaches require manual feature extraction, and lack the capability to discover previously unknown neural features in more complex data. Consequently, this would hinder the expressiveness of the models. To address these challenges, we propose a Neurocognitive Variational Autoencoder (NCVA) to conjoin high-dimensional EEG with a cognitive model in both generative and predictive modeling analyses. Importantly, our NCVA enables both the prediction of EEG signals given behavioral data and the estimation of cognitive model parameters from EEG signals. This novel approach can allow for a more comprehensive understanding of the triplet relationship between behavior, brain activity, and cognitive processes.",Psychology
810,,"Most work in the last 50 years on visual working memory and attention has used a classic psychophysical setup: participants are instructed to attend to, or remember, a set of items. This setup sidesteps the role of cognitive control; effort is maximal, tasks are simple, and strategies are limited. While this approach has yielded important insights, it provides no clear path toward an integrative theory (Kristjánsson &amp; Draschkow, 2021) and, like studying a town’s walkability by having its college students run the 50-yard dash, it runs the danger of focusing on edge cases. Here, in this theoretical opinion article, we argue for an approach with a Gibsonian flavor where dynamic relationships between the agent and the environment are understood functionally, in light of an agent’s goals. This means a shift in emphasis from the performance of the mechanisms underlying a narrow task (“remember these items!”) to their control in pursuit of a naturalistic goal (“make a sandwich!”, Land &amp; Hayhoe, 2001). Here, we highlight the sampling-remembering trade-off between exploiting goal-relevant information in the environment versus maintaining it in working memory. We present a dynamic feedback model of this trade-off – where the individual weighs the subjective costs of accessing external information versus those of maintaining it in memory – using insights from existing cognitive control models based on economic principles (Kool &amp; Botvinick, 2018). This trade-off is particularly interesting in children, as the optimal use of internal resources is even more crucial when limited. Our model makes some specific predictions for future research: 1) an individual child strikes a preferred balance between the effort to attend to goal-relevant information in the environment versus the effort to maintain it in working memory, and 2) in order to maintain this balance as underlying memory and cognitive control mechanisms improve, the child will have to increasingly shift toward remembering.",Psychology
811,,"Question-asking, a foundational aspect of human communication, is an integral part of information-seeking behavior. This review delves into the complex landscape of question asking theories, exploring their many intersections with a myriad of fields such as social discourse, early development, problem solving, artificial intelligence (AI), and educational applications. We explore not just why asking questions is important for cognitive development and learning, but also the nature of good questions and potential benefits of learning to ask better, more complex questions. To this aim, we introduce the Question-Asking in Information Seeking (QuInS) framework, a comprehensive framework synthesizing decades of research on question-asking across developmental, social, educational, and technological domains. Through QuInS, we introduce a unified perspective on the iterative, dynamic processes that drive inquiry, emphasizing how curiosity, creativity, and cognitive engagement shape effective question-asking. We examine the origins of question-asking in childhood, theories of inquiry as information-seeking behavior, and the role of complex, open-ended questions in fostering creativity and problem-solving. In addition, we explore how advancements in AI, computational models, and educational strategies help us formulate better questioning approaches. Lastly, we highlight the implications and future research directions which arise from these different theories and explore how these findings can be harnessed to make people more efficient, effective and creative learners and question askers.",Psychology
812,,"We present a new illusion that challenges our understanding of visual scale. Since Helmholtz’s ‘telestereoscope’ (1857), we’ve known that stereo vision governs visual scale, turning a real-world scene into a miniature scene despite all other depth cues being present. This effect is attributed to vergence and/or vertical disparities (Howard &amp; Rogers, 2012). By contrast, Linton (2018) BioRxiv, attributes the effect to horizontal disparities. To adjudicate between these two accounts, we build a virtual reality ‘telestereoscope’ that can decouple changes in vergence and vertical disparity from changes in horizontal disparity. First, when horizontal disparity is ramped-up, but vergence and vertical disparity are normal, the scene looks miniature. This is an astounding effect, given all other distance cues indicate a normal scene. Second, when vergence and vertical disparity are ramped-up, but horizontal disparity is normal, the scene looks normal, challenging the role that vergence and vertical disparity play in visual scale. Third, ramping-up horizontal disparity also changes the slope of the ground-plane. Fourth, keeping vergence and vertical disparity fixed whilst ramping-up horizontal disparity creates a startling illusion. We judge the scene as a whole to reduce in scale, even though all that changes in our visual experience is a distortion of 3D shape (of the scene and its objects). The illusion changes our concept of ‘visual scale’ from being something that we directly perceive (vision having a range-finder, like vergence or vertical disparity) to something we merely cognitively infer on the basis of an association between accentuated 3D shape and closer distances.",Psychology
813,,"Objective: Early improvement predicts good outcome in psychotherapy for eating disorders. Prior studies have examined change in body mass index (BMI) or Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire scores (EDE-Q) as indicators of early response, but not both simultaneously. Little research has examined early change among Anorexia Nervosa (AN) samples treated with eating disorder-focussed cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT-ED). We studied the process of early change in a fine-grained way to better understand whether early response predicts later response and post-treatment outcomes in CBT-ED for AN, and how the changes in EDE-Q and BMI are related. Method: Adults (N=193) diagnosed with AN were treated with outpatient CBT-ED. We used bivariate latent change score models to examine change in BMI and EDE-Q and relations between them. Results: Early change in BMI was independent of early change in EDE-Q. Larger changes in EDE-Q over the first five weeks of therapy followed smaller ones over the next five weeks, meanwhile smaller changes followed larger ones. Early change was predictive of post-treatment scores. Conclusion: Early change in BMI and EDE-Q during CBT-ED appear to be unrelated and follow different trajectories. Therefore, individuals declared as early responders may differ depending on which variable is used for the decision.",Psychology
814,,"The Gut-Brain Axis (GBA) is a bidirectional communication system between the central nervous system (CNS) and the enteric nervous system (ENS), with recent research highlighting the key role of gut microbiota in regulating GBA functions. This study aims to explore the effects of probiotics on adolescents’ cognitive abilities, memory, and emotions. A double-blind, randomized controlled trial was conducted, involving 15 healthy adolescents aged 15 to 18, randomly assigned to a treatment group receiving probiotics and a control group receiving a placebo. The study included baseline assessments, a four-week intervention, and post-intervention evaluations using the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). The MoCA scores showed significant cognitive improvement in the treatment group, while the control group’s improvement was not significant. PANAS scores indicated a significant increase in positive emotions in the treatment group, with no notable changes in the control group. The results support the hypothesis that probiotics positively impact adolescent cognitive function and emotional state by regulating gut microbiota. Despite the limited sample size, this study provides preliminary scientific evidence for the potential therapeutic application of probiotics in adolescents. Future studies should include larger sample sizes and longer intervention periods to further validate these findings.",Psychology
815,,"Objectives: Numerous studies have focused on the ways to cultivate self-compassion (SC). Most of the SC interventions were typically lengthy and did not capture momentary fluctuations in SC after each exercise in the intervention. Therefore, we explored the impact of repeated self-compassionate writing as an ecological momentary intervention (EMI). 
Method: Seventy-five participants completed a 3-week study with signals sent twice daily, resulting in 1,980 observations collected. During the 1-week control period, participants were asked to report their experiences of negative events, momentary SC, and momentary stress. In the subsequent 1-week intervention period, they engaged in SC writing whenever they experienced negative events. Trait SC and weekly stress were also evaluated before and after the intervention, including a 1-week follow-up period. 
Results: Multilevel modeling showed a slight sifnificant increase in momentary SC and a reduction in momentary stress. However, the slope did not differ significantly between the intervention and control periods. Moreover, there were no significant changes in trait SC nor in weekly stress, although the weekly stress levels showed a decreasing trend with a small effect size from pre to post intervention.
Conclusions: This study provided preliminary evidence of the feasibility and utility of EMI in cultivating SC using repeated self-compassionate writing. Although the effect sizes were small, the study highlighted possible approaches to increase the effectiveness of the intervention.

816,,"Language reflects how people organize experience into categories, and cross-linguistic studies have revealed universal tendencies in the categorization of domains such as kinship and color.  Here we consider universal tendencies involving the parity of category systems, and develop and test a theory that predicts whether category systems for a given domain tend to include an even or an odd number of categories. Consistent with the theory, we find that deictic day-naming and tense-marking systems tend to have an odd number of categories, but that systems for domains including seasons, phases of the moon, kinship, and cardinal directions tend to have an even number of categories. Our theory is founded on the principle of symmetry, and our results therefore provide evidence of the widespread influence of symmetry on categorization across languages and domains.",Psychology
817,,"Neuroimaging hyperscanning—the monitoring of brain activity of two or more persons simultaneously—has emerged as a popular tool to uncover the neural mechanisms of social interactions. The use of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)—a non-invasive, child-friendly technique tolerant of motion artifacts—has significantly advanced this line of research. Despite its popularity, the field has yet to agree on best practices for quantifying inter-brain connections (IBC) during social interactions, including the frequency of interest (FOI) for signal analysis. Consequently, past research findings have been inconsistent. In this study, we reviewed various methods used and their corresponding FOI results in previous fNIRS hyperscanning research focused on the topics of cooperation, collaboration and/or coordination. Additionally, we proposed a new methodology to quantify FOI that aimed to uncover the origin of synchronization between brains. We tested the proposed method on two independent fNIRS hyperscanning datasets involving different populations and social interactions, which are commonly reported in the literature. We offer a method for testing and adoption within the fNIRS community, aimed at eliminating arbitrary FOI selections and potentially enhancing the reproducibility of results in future fNIRS hyperscanning research.",Psychology
818,,"The perirhinal (PrC) and anterolateral entorhinal cortex (alErC) are among the first brain regions affected by Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Yet, their precise cognitive role remains unclear. Recent models propose that these regions support episodic familiarity and lifetime familiarity in tasks requiring fine conceptual discrimination. Evidence in aging and AD is however lacking. We assessed episodic (Task 1) and lifetime familiarity judgments (Task 2) using materials with varying levels of conceptual overlap and lifetime familiarity for targets and lures (Task 3) in normal and pathological aging. Fifty-eight older adults (aged 55+), including healthy individuals and patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment or Subjective Cognitive Decline, completed familiarity tasks. PrC and alErC volumes were measured via high-resolution MRI and correlated with tasks performance. The PrC and alErC volumes were linked with both episodic and lifetime familiarity, but only when fine conceptual discrimination was needed. Exploratory cluster analysis identified three subgroups: one composed of healthy individuals, another including majoritarily patients with memory impairment, and a third, more heterogeneous group, potentially representing early cognitive decline. The latter group relied on familiarity to compensate for impaired recollection but committed more false alarms and showed reduced accuracy as conceptual overlap increased. The results support the role of the PrC/alErC in mediating familiarity for fine representations. We also discuss how combining tasks that assess different aspects of familiarity could help identify early cognitive decline and suggest that this approach should be tested in patients with amyloid biomarkers of AD.",Psychology
819,,"Abstract 

Importance: Postpartum depression (PPD) is common, undertreated, and debilitating for women and infants. There is an urgent need for scalable treatments for PPD. Women with PPD experience disruptions in reward-supported behaviors - reduced behavioral activation and social reward responsivity. Thus, the reward system is a promising target for psychotherapy. 

Objective: Engage &amp; Connect (E&amp;C) is a novel neuroscience-informed psychotherapy that increases engagement in rewarding social experiences to restore reward-supported behaviors and reduce PPD. We tested whether E&amp;C reduces depression severity and is feasible and acceptable for women with PPD. We also examined whether improved reward-supported behaviors are mediators of response to E&amp;C.  

Design: A pilot one-arm study of women with postpartum depression from November 17, 2022 to January 26, 2024 in a large healthcare system.  

Setting: Women were recruited from Weill Cornell Medicine/NewYork Presbyterian Hospital and New York City communities to this remote study.  

Participants: 38 women, up to 1-year post delivery, with PPD.  

Intervention: Engage &amp; Connect (E&amp;C) is a 9-week remote intervention, delivered by community therapists. It aims to reduce depression by increasing engagement in rewarding social activities.  

Main Outcomes and Measures: Our primary outcome was PPD severity, measured with the EPDS. Secondary outcomes included social reward responsivity (ACIPS) and behavioral activation (BADS) – candidate mediators of EPDS reduction. Additional secondary outcomes were perceived social support (MSSPS) and infant-mother bonding (PBQ). Semi-structured interviews and retention rates measured acceptability.  

Results: Among 38 women (Mean Age=34.7 [SD=3.69]; 71% White, 18% Asian, 3% Black, 5% other, 10% Hispanic), E&amp;C was feasible and acceptable (86% retention). Our primary outcome, PPD severity, significantly reduced during E&amp;C (EPDS change=8.6 points (SD=3.8); 83% remission, 73% response). Further, we observed significant improvement in behavioral activation and social reward responsivity, that mediated EPDS reduction (ACIPS [ACME] = -.052; BADS [ACME]= -.18). Finally, we also found improvements in perceived social support and infant bonding. 

Conclusions and Relevance: E&amp;C may be a promising scalable first-line psychotherapy for PPD that reduces PPD by improving reward system functions and lead to long-term benefits for mothers and infants.

820,,"Language-rich classroom talk would offer opportune moments for student’s oral language and learning development. But, getting students to talk can be challenging. One way to promote classroom discussions is by using talk moves. Talk moves are conversation tools that educators and students can use to help students share ideas, listen carefully, reason deeply, and think with peers. The goal of the current study was to evaluate whether a Talk Moves intervention that was implemented in a special education primary classroom was associated with children’s oral language and participation skills. We found that the teacher and students used more talk moves over the course of the intervention, which coincided with the students talking more. Students also felt more comfortable and confident talking and participating in class after the intervention. Importantly, there were improvements on students’ use of academic vocabulary and language test scores. No changes were found on students’ sentence length and complexity, nor reading scores. Overall, results indicate that teachers could implement talk moves in their classroom to support all students’ engagement in academic conversations.",Psychology
821,,"Purpose: The use of consistent terminologies in clinical practice eases communication and collaboration. Further, the knowledge that comes with a label can be empowering for families. However, terminology presents an ongoing challenge in the field of speech-language pathology. The goal of the current research initiative was to examine whether clinicians in the field of speech-language pathology (speech-language pathologists, communication disorder assistants, and those in similar roles) implement consistent terminology in their practice after a province-wide knowledge translation training. 
Method: Clinicians received a training that directly and explicitly encouraged the use of clinical labels as part of practice and specifically outlined which labels to use. Pre- and post- training surveys were collected before and after clinicians reviewed the educational training webinar, respectively. Following the training, clinicians were encouraged to implement the practice for a pilot period before completing a follow-up survey. The pre-post-follow-up survey responses were collected to assess change in knowledge and action in incorporating clinical labels in practice. 
Results: On average, we found that while clinicians (n = 123) were ready to embrace the use of labels in practice, they were still in the early stages of implementing changes by follow-up. Immediately after the training, clinicians, particularly speech-language pathologists, demonstrated improved knowledge and confidence and high intentions to implement the recommended labels. By follow-up, knowledge and confidence were maintained but reported use of most recommended labels decreased.
Conclusion: The current initiative serves as an important first step in influencing practice change. while also highlighting barriers that need to be addressed and multiple supports that need to be in place to make practice change happen.",Psychology
822,,"In a previous study (Dall’Olio et al., 2024), we observed that preschool children who viewed a presentation in immersive virtual reality (IVR) had significantly poorer learning outcomes than those who viewed the presentation in a less immersive desktop virtual reality (D-VR) condition. One possible explanation is that IVR may cause too much cognitive load therefore impairing learning. The two follow-up studies discussed in this paper once again compared IVR and D-VR, but this time with a view of two factors that may reduce the cognitive load of IVR: the level of detail of the presentation (high detail/low detail) and the viewer’s habituation to the medium (habituated/not habituated). In the first study, we investigated whether the learning outcomes of a presentation delivered to 159 preschool children aged four to six years differed based on the levels of detail and immersion (IVR/D-VR). Contrary to our hypotheses, we observed no significant impact of detail or immersion, nor was there any significant interaction between these two features. In the second study, we compared the learning outcomes of 72 preschool children with different levels of habituation to the medium used. Again, contrary to our hypotheses, we found no significant impact of medium habituation and immersion and no interaction between these two variables. We report inconclusive evidence here and suggest that further research is needed. Specifically, future studies should examine additional factors that may influence learning outcomes, as well as the effects of different IVR methods in varied learning situations, and with children of different ages.",Psychology
823,,"Most previous research has investigated whether performing a demanding cognitive task reduces the time a person can hold a subsequent physical effort. However, no previous research has investigated if performing an intense physical exercise reduces the time a person can complete a cognitive task with an adequate level of performance. The aim of this study was to assess the subjective, behavioral and physiological responses of performing an intense physical exercise on a posterior cognitive tak until failure.
In a pre-registered, randomized, within-participant design experiment, 29 physically active participants completed a cognitive task until failure after running at 90% maximal aerobic speed until failure or after walking for 10 min (control condition). During the cognitive task, brain activity was recorded with an electroencephalogram and brain complexity was quantified. Multidimensional subjective experience was assessed with the Temporal Experience Tracing method (TET). Sequential Bayesian analysis for the main hypothesis (intense physical exercise reduces cognitive task performance) until it reached strong evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis (BF10 &gt; 6) or the null hypothesis (BF10 &lt; 1/6) were conducted.
The physical exercise induced a reduction in maximal force generating capacity and increased rate of perceived exertion compared to the control condition, evidencing the strong differences in physical workload between conditions. The total duration to complete the cognitive task in both conditions were 4755.8 s (95% CI 3326.8 - 5107.8) and 4308.2 s (95% CI 3902.9 - 5481.2) for the control and experimental conditions, respectively with no evidence of difference across sessions (BF10 = 0.329). Subjective experience analysis identified two distinct clusters of task-related demands, but the time spent in these experiential states did not differ between conditions. However, cognitive task performance was better in the phases of low perceived demands. Brain complexity was lower after the maximal aerobic speed effort, indicating a potential shift in physiological states, although neither behavioral (cognitive) performance nor subjective feelings were affected.",Psychology
824,,"A large number of EEG studies have identified a distinct event related potential (ERP) component during  error  processing  known  as  the  Error-Related  Negativity  (ERN).

Using  a flanker task, thirty-one college-aged participants responded to the direction of a central arrow with acoustic  startle  probes administered  pseudo-randomly  throughout.  Hajcak  and  Foti’s  (2008) findings indicated the ERN is indicative of individual variations in aversive reactions to errors.

825,,"Background: Many gaps exist regarding intergenerational transmission of attachment at preschool-age when narrative attachment measures first become available for children. We aimed to examine (1) concordance between parent and preschoolers’ attachment representations, (2) parental sensitivity during parent-child interactions as a potential proximate mechanism of intergenerational attachment transmission, and (3) the degree to which patterns of effects may vary as function of parent gender at this age. 
Methods: Our sample comprised 104 5-year-olds (53 girls) and one of their respective parents (n=52 mothers and n=52 fathers). We collected the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI) from parents and a novel adaptation of the story-completion method (Picture-based Story-Stem Battery; PSSB). Parent and child narratives were scored from transcripts using coding systems by Main and colleagues for AAIs and by Hill and colleagues and Robinson and colleagues for story completions. Parental behavioral sensitivity was rated using the NICHD Sensitivity Scales. 
Results and Conclusions: Parental attachment security and behavioral sensitivity were associated with child security. Mediation analysis supported an indirect path from parental insecure-dismissing AAI-classification to child insecurity via reduced sensitivity. Parent gender-specific analyses yielded effect sizes that were stronger (though still statistically comparable) for paths from maternal vs. paternal security and sensitivity to child security.",Psychology
826,,"A long-standing debate in the psychology of learning and memory is whether contingency awareness – explicit recognition of the relationship between conditioned stimuli (CS) and unconditioned stimuli (US) – is a prerequisite for fear acquisition in humans. In an extensive participant pool (N=895), we systematically investigated the impact of manipulating core experimental parameters and individual differences that may moderate contingency awareness. Key parameters included presence of online expectancy or fear ratings, engagement in concurrent tasks, sensory modalities of CS and US, and type of instruction. These manipulations strongly influenced the proportion of participants who acquired contingency awareness, ranging between 47% and 96%, with only aware participants exhibited conditioned responses. We confirm that contingency awareness is necessary for human fear conditioning, and highlight the parameters that experimenters can use to ensure learning. Individual differences in age, personality traits, and working memory capacity did not contribute to the probability of becoming contingency aware.",Psychology
827,,"Situations change over time, and so does our experience of them. For example, a task may initially feel engaging but can, over time, become monotonous and boring. Similarly, as processing demands increase or one’s momentary capabilities decline, the same task can feel more or less effortful. The dynamics of these task-induced sensations matter because boredom and perceived effort shape behavior by driving optimization of resource utilization. A fundamental resource people do not want to waste is time. Here, we propose that the sensations of boredom and effort influence how the passing of time is experienced. Specifically, both states are linked to changes in interoception—the perception of internal bodily signals—which is known to play a key role in time perception. This proposal offers a framework for understanding how fundamental regulatory sensations, such as boredom and effort, shape temporal experience through interoceptive mechanisms. We highlight the insular cortex as a potential hub mediating the effects of interoceptive signals on time perception, integrating feelings of boredom and effort, and their influence on the experience of time.",Psychology
828,,"Social anxiety is a prevalent mental disorder categorized within the broader spectrum of anxiety disorders. Within human-centered studies, researchers frequently utilize self-reported scales (SRS) to recruit and longitudinally monitor participants experiencing social anxiety, primarily due to their time efficiency. However, the validity of these SRS must be established within the specific population under study to ensure predictive validity and enable cross-study analyses. In this study, we conducted the first-time validation of the widely used SRS, the Social Interaction Anxiety Scale (SIAS), in comparison with the already established Social Phobia Inventory (SPIN) in the Indian population. Our sample comprised 425 Indian students from various regions of India. The SIAS demonstrated a high concurrence validation coefficient of 0.8 with the SPIN, indicating strong agreement between the two instruments.

  
Besides validating the SIAS, our study also explores the prevalence of social anxiety among the student population in the post-COVID-19 pandemic era. While numerous prevalence studies have been conducted with the student population before the pandemic, our investigation sheds light on the current landscape. Our findings revealed a notable prevalence of social anxiety, with 40\% of students experiencing symptoms. These statistics underscore the urgent need for effective digital interventions to address social anxiety disorder, particularly considering the high population density and limited availability of psychiatrists in India. Furthermore, our study identified key concerns reported by students in their daily lives, including difficulties in making new friends, initiating conversations, attending social gatherings, and expressing themselves. An important insight gleaned from our research is that students are not hesitant to communicate with individuals in higher positions. However, it is noteworthy that females exhibited lower comfort levels in these interactions than males.",Psychology
829,,"Instrumental movements are kinematically different from communicative movements. Kinematics differ when we use our hands to hammer a nail vs. using them to describe hammering a nail. Here, we ask whether communicative movements all share the same kinematic profiles and thus differ from instrumental movements in the same way. We compared spontaneous gestures produced by hearing speakers when they talk (co-speech gesture) to productive iconic signs produced by deaf signers when the signs superficially resemble co-speech gestures (classifier signs). We used motion tracking and kinematic analyses to disentangle the spatial and temporal kinematic patterns of communicative movements in 33 English-speakers and 10 American Sign Language (ASL) signers, using each group’s instrumental movements as a control. Participants copied a movement on an object performed by a model (instrumental movement) and then described what they did with the object (communicative movement). We found no instrumental-communicative differences between groups in spatial kinematics. However, for temporal kinematics, speakers’ co-speech movements were less rhythmic and jerkier than their instrumental movements; in contrast, signers’ communicative movements were more rhythmic and smoother than their instrumental movements. We thus found differences in the temporal (but not spatial) kinematic signatures of co-speech gestures vs. classifier signs, leading to 3 conclusions: (i) communicative movements do not always have the same kinematic signatures; (ii) since signers’ and speakers’ communicative movements have different kinematic features, even highly iconic signed movements cannot be considered entirely gestural; and (iii) we need fine-grained techniques to measure movement components when identifying the gestural aspects of sign.",Psychology
830,,"Looking behavior during route learning is uniquely attuned to information relevant for
navigation, which unfolds continuously over time. To better understand how visual information
is used to learn routes, we tracked eye-position in participants on a guided walk through a
simulated urban environment. The route was presented twice to participants in either a natural
sequential order or a randomly scrambled order. After viewing the route, participants were
presented with images of the intersections and asked to report the correct direction to continue
travel along the route. Predictably, the sequential group performed much better on memory for
the route than the scrambled group. Analyses of the eye-data revealed reliable differences
between groups during route learning but no differences during scene viewing in the memory test
trials. Specifically, while both groups looked at objects such as people and cars during route
learning, looking at the path ahead was highly predictive of being in the sequential group,
whereas looking at buildings ahead was predictive of being in the scrambled group. The results
suggest that route learning involves encoding, and anticipating, information about the path to-betraveled, perhaps reflecting formation of a temporally continuous representation of the route. In
contrast, those in the scrambled group appeared to rely on building landmarks to attempt to
create a map of the route, albeit unsuccessfully.",Psychology
831,,"Saffran, Newport, and Aslin (1996) demonstrated that adults can recognize words of an artificial language at an above chance level after mere exposure to statistical regularities in the speech stream. This seminal work led to a resurgence of interest in how experience contributes to language acquisition. Although statistical learning in adults has been replicated in many studies, null effects have also been reported in the literature. In this paper, I critically review the statistical analyses performed by Saffran, Newport, and Aslin (1996) and discuss how some practices could have increased the false positive rate and caused difficulties in interpreting the results, including the lack of generalizability. As effect sizes are commonly inflated in earlier publications, I also conduct a publication-bias-adjusted meta-analysis focused on 20 studies that closely followed the original experimental design. The adjusted effect size is between the two original effect sizes from Saffran, Newport, and Aslin’s (1996) Experiments 1 and 2. Suggestions are given for future research on adult statistical learning and the broader field of psycholinguistics.",Psychology
832,,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) has shown promise in accomplishing tasks traditionally performed by humans across a range of domains. However, while previous studies have assessed AI's ability to perform these tasks, there remains a gap in understanding whether AI can carry out these tasks with the same level of expertise and finesse as human professionals. Moreover, while AI's performance has been examined in certain domains, it has not been sufficiently tested across all fields where human expertise is vital. To address these gaps, we conducted a study involving 32 expert participants across various domains, who provided prompts and evaluated the responses generated by ChatGPT Plus. Our results, consistent across domains, reveal that AI can perform tasks at a basic level, most of the time, but it falls short in replicating the depth and quality of human expertise. Despite these limitations, AI can provide a solid starting point and assist experts in specific contexts. Future work can explore the use of other forms of AI, such as humanoid AI bots, to assess tasks that require interaction among multiple participants or teams, offering potential avenues for deeper collaboration and more advanced automation.",Psychology
833,,"Digital health interventions are increasingly necessary to bridge gaps in mental health care, providing scalable and accessible solutions to address unmet needs. Relationship challenges, a significant driver of individual well-being and distress, are often under-supported due to barriers such as stigma, cost, and limited access to trained therapists. This study evaluates Amanda, a GPT-4-powered voice-based chatbot, designed to deliver single-session relationship support and enhance therapeutic engagement through natural and collaborative interactions. Participants (N = 54) completed a range of clinical outcome measures and their attitudes toward chatbots and digital health interventions pre- and post-intervention as well as two weeks later. In the interactions with the chatbot, the participants explored a range of relational issues and reported significant improvements in problem-specific outcomes, including reduced distress, enhanced communication, and greater confidence in managing conflicts directly after the interaction as well as two weeks later. While generic relationship outcomes showed only delayed improvements, individual well-being did not significantly change. Participants rated Amanda highly on usability, therapeutic skills, and working alliance, with reduced repetitiveness compared to the text-based version. These findings underscore the potential of voice-based chatbots to deliver accessible and effective relationship support. Future research should explore multi-session formats, clinical populations, and comparisons with other large language models to refine and expand AI-powered interventions.",Psychology
834,,"In this dissertation, we investigate the qualitative structure, phenomenology, recollective experience, and determinants of ‘Flashbulb memories (FBMs)’ – autobiographical recalls of the circumstances in which an individual learned about an important and emotionally arousing public event – and their associated ‘Event memories (EMs)’ – non-autobiographical recalls of the event in itself. Research on FBMs is currently enduring heated theoretical debates about the ‘special status’ of these memories, and their relationship with EMs. We address these issues in light of two chief hypotheses: (1) FBMs are ‘special’ because of their iconicity, (2) FBMs and EMs rely on different memory systems. Along these premises, we present a systematic review of the literature and three empirical studies focusing on real-life public events. Along these, we adopt a test-retest methodology with long retention times to investigate FBMs’ and EMs’ evolution, and the factors underlying their formation and maintenance. Results of the systematic review show that FBMs are characterised by exceptional vividness and perceptive features. Building on this, we propose a new theoretical frame (Studies 1 and 2) in which we identify and characterize ‘perceptive core images’, a memory component that we argue is crucial in explaining the nature of FBMs and facilitating their long-term retrieval. Finally, we show (Study 3) that the long-term evolutions of FBMs and EMs are independent; and that the two are characterized by different recollective processes and predicted by different factors. Theoretical and practical implications of this frame are discussed.",Psychology
835,,"This pilot study investigated the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of a low-threshold, gamified virtual reality (VR) breathing exercise with respiratory biofeedback (Flowborne VR) for promoting relaxation in primary school students. 26 students (aged 10-16 years) from the Canton of Schaffhausen, Switzerland, participated in single-session, within-subjects design in a naturalistic school setting. Participants provided self-reports on various facets of user experience and intervention feasibility, as well as their current mood state before and after the intervention. Observational data on task adherence, encountered difficulties, and breathing behavior were also collected, alongside objective breathing data recorded by the VR application. Results indicated that the VR immersion was generally well-tolerated, with no significant symptoms of simulator sickness occurring, despite some practical issues in properly adjusting the VR headset. Participants found the breathing exercise easy to understand, demonstrated high levels of task adherence, and reported low feelings of overwhelm. The intervention received positive ratings, including usability, design, engagement, and biofeedback responsiveness. Most participants were able to adopt a breathing style characterized by strong abdominal movements and prolonged exhalations, although further practice seems necessary to fully master slow diaphragmatic breathing. Significant improvements were observed in self-reported mood and calmness from pre- to post-intervention. The findings provide preliminary evidence for the feasibility of integrating gamified VR-based relaxation exercises into everyday educational contexts and suggest that the engaging nature of VR coupled with biofeedback can offer a valuable tool for promoting stress management skills in children. However, the small sample size, lack of a control group, and single-session design limit the generalizability of the results. Future research with controlled longitudinal designs is needed to further investigate the effects of this promising intervention.",Psychology
836,,"In this paper, I examine the widespread phenomenon of decline narratives in human societies, where the past is idealized as a “golden age” characterized by extraordinary abundance, strength, longevity, and supernatural powers, in contrast to a flawed present. Drawing on ethnographic, historical, and psychological evidence, I explore the cultural manifestations and cognitive foundations of these narratives. The analysis highlights the roles of cognitive biases such as rosy retrospection and narrative inflation, as well as the strategic use of temporal distancing to rationalize fantastical beliefs by situating them in a distant, unfalsifiable past. By comparing decline narratives in traditional societies with progress narratives in modern, industrialized contexts, I discuss how these contrasting frameworks shape cultural attitudes toward tradition and change and consider their broader implications for understanding how cultural narratives influence human behavior.",Psychology

838,,"High status within social hierarchies is often the reserve of socially dominant individuals. Faster responses have been identified as a cognitive predisposition of socially dominant individuals, thought to confer an advantage by allowing them to act first in social contexts. Response speed is also thought to reflect decision confidence, but this has not been directly investigated in relation to social dominance. Moreover, personality traits, such as extraversion, may show a similar relationship with decision-making speed and confidence and may explain any relationship with social dominance. Confidence is thought to be domain specific and it is therefore important to assess whether any association between decision confidence and social dominance, is also observed in other cognitive domains. Across three studies, we assessed performance on a two-choice statistical learning decision-making task and a self-referential memory task. To measure metacognitive bias, we included confidence for both decisions and memory traces. We also included a measure of extraversion to investigate whether these two related personality traits explain overlapping or unique variance in task performance.  Across three studies, social dominance and extraversion were positively correlated. Both social dominance and extraversion independently predicted variance on confidence for decisions, with stronger evidence for a unique role for social dominance, but no relationship was identified for confidence in memory traces.",Psychology
839,,"Asylum applications lodged by sexual minorities are expected to continue increasing in the future. Asylum interviews should be conducted in a way that supports fair and accurate asylum decision-making. Yet, psychological research has identified shortcomings in current asylum interviewing techniques. In this study, we analyzed interview style, question type, and question content in 129 Finnish asylum cases based on sexual orientation. Officials mainly used the information-gathering style of interviewing and rarely used the most unrecommended (i.e., suggested and forced choice) question types (3%). However, only 12% of all questions were open questions, whereas focused and yes/no questions were predominant. Over half of all questions sought to establish the credibility of the applicants’ sexual orientation, whereas 29% of questions inquired about accounts of persecution. To assess the credibility of sexual orientation, officials primarily asked about applicants’ relationships, their feelings, and their sexual identity development, reflecting Western understandings of sexuality. Asking more open questions and focusing more extensively on assessing applicants’ persecution risk would improve current interviewing practice. To support fair and accurate asylum decision-making, future research should investigate how non-Western queer people experience their sexual identity development. Training programs could also support asylum officials in conducting interviews in this context.",Psychology

841,,"The multiple-demand (MD) network serves as a core system for domain-general cognitive control, with robust activation with increased demand across diverse tasks. While fMRI studies have characterised the MD network’s role in cognitive demand, linking these findings to electrophysiological activity remains a critical challenge. This article discusses the potential of oscillatory and aperiodic neural activity to bridge this gap. Although recent meta-analyses highlight mid-frontal theta power as a robust marker of task demand, its localised spatial distribution, limited cross-task generalisability, and potential confounds from aperiodic components limit its ability to fully represent the MD network. In contrast, aperiodic activity, particularly broadband power, has emerged as a strong candidate for indexing task demand due to its robust decoding performance and cross-task generalisability in response to diverse task demands, and spatial overlap with MD regions. Aperiodic activity may reflect fundamental neural properties, such as spiking rates and excitation/inhibition (E/I) balance, and is scale-free and exists across modalities, positioning it as a promising mechanism underpinning domain-general cognitive control that links to the MD network. Meanwhile, multiplexed low-frequency oscillations (e.g., delta and theta) may implement inter-regional synchronisation within the MD network, enabling large-scale coordination between MD subregions that supports cognitive control. Together, this article proposes a hypothetical framework linking the MD network to electrophysiological responses: Aperiodic broadband power, potentially reflecting population-level spiking activity, may support activation within MD regions, while multiplexed low-frequency oscillatory synchronisations may mediate inter-regional connectivity between MD regions.",Psychology
842,,"Background: Hairpulling (HP) is a body-focused repetitive behaviour that typically begins in early adolescence. However, most research on HP has focused on adults, with large gaps in our understanding of the phenomenology and mechanisms involved in HP in adolescence. A key empirically unexplained phenomenon in paediatric HP is the common co-occurrence of trichotillomania, depression, and anxiety disorders, all of which appear to become more severe over time. Shame is a prevalent self-critical emotion experienced by adults with BFRBs and a significant predictor of symptoms of depression and anxiety in adolescence and therefore may explain the process underlying the relationship between adolescent HP
and depressive and anxiety symptoms.
Methods: This cross-sectional, survey-based study examined both HP phenomenology and the mediating role of shame in relationships between HP severity and symptoms of depression and anxiety in a community-based sample of adolescents who engage in problematic HP. One hundred twenty-eight adolescents aged 13-18 completed measures of HP phenomenology, HP severity, shame, depression symptoms, and anxiety symptoms.
Results: Phenomenological findings demonstrated a relatively high prevalence of trance HP, trichophagia, and pulling from multiple sites. Mediational analyses revealed that shame partially mediated the relationship between HP severity and depression symptoms and fully mediated the relationship between HP severity and anxiety symptoms.
Conclusions: Our phenomenological findings highlight the need for further examination of trance HP and other HP phenomenological features in youth. Our mediational results novelly suggest that shame may play a crucial role in the development and maintenance of co-occurring depression and anxiety symptomology in adolescent HP, underscoring the potential importance of targeting shame in improved HP interventions.",Psychology
843,,"This paper introduces a novel software solution to address the challenges of automated identification of Areas of Interest (AOIs) in dynamic, head-mounted display virtual reality (VR) environments, with a focus on applica-tions in forensic psychology. Traditional eye-tracking tools often require manual annotation of AOIs when analyzing moving objects, such as faces, in dynamic 360-degree VR scenarios—a process that is time-intensive. The pre-sented software utilizes RetinaFace to generate consistent AOIs by dynami-cally tracking facial coordinates across video frames, accounting for variabil-ity in head movements. Outputs are seamlessly formatted for analysis in iMotions, enabling robust synchronization and visualization of gaze data. Validation against manual annotation confirms the system’s high accuracy (92.2%). By automating a previously manual process, the software provides researchers with an efficient and scalable tool for analyzing complex visual attention data, significantly enhancing the feasibility of large-scale VR stud-ies in forensic and psychological research. An empirical example illustrates how the software can be used.",Psychology
844,,"We use our private feelings of confidence to coordinate our public, social lives. For example, when making joint decisions we can share our uncertainty honestly to reach an accurate consensus, or exaggerate our confidence to exaggerate our influence on the group.  Some theories in cognitive neuroscience suggest that we can strategically distort the confidence we express to others while leaving our private feelings unchanged. But other theories suppose that our interactions with others may be a key source of beliefs about uncertainty in our own minds. If the latter is true, communicating about confidence with others could alter introspection on ourselves. We tested this idea in a novel decision-making task, where participants made perceptual choices and gave confidence ratings alone, together with a partner and then alone again. Across studies, participants showed ‘confidence matching’, with the confidence they expressed gravitating towards the confidence of their partners. Most importantly, these shifts in reported confidence persisted even after the interaction terminated, and participants made decisions alone again. These effects can be captured by a new predictive learning model, which assumes that agents use the confidence expressed by themselves and others to predict the confidence they ought to feel. These results reveal how the dynamics of social interaction can shape our sense of confidence and point to a mechanism that explains how communication with others can change our private states of mind.",Psychology
845,,"A central question in cognition is how representations are integrated across different modalities such as language and vision. One prominent hypothesis posits the existence of an abstract, pre-linguistic language of vision that organises meaning compositionally to enable cross-modal integration. This hypothesis predicts that the language of vision operates universally, independent of linguistic surface features such as word order. We conducted eye-tracking experiments where participants described visual scenes in English, Portuguese, and Japanese. By analysing eye-movement sequences alongside spoken descriptions, we demonstrate that semantic similarity between sentences strongly predicts the similarity of associated scan patterns in all three languages, even across scenes and for sentences in different languages. In contrast, the effect of syntactic similarity was found to be language-dependent and restricted to scene context. Our findings support a universal language of vision as an organising principle of meaning that transcends
syntactic structures.",Psychology

This review critically engages with the current state of gamified interventions for misinformation, identifies gaps in game design and research, and investigates the relationship between inoculation theory and game design. We find that homogeneity in design has left some areas of game design underexplored, and discussion surrounding game design decisions – particularly the integration of inoculation theory components – is often superficial. We call for deeper exploration of game design and the integration of inoculation theory components, proposing a hypothetical model of inoculation theory in gamified contexts.",Psychology

Five parental involvement profiles were identified based on four dimensions (autonomy support, psychological control, structure, and warmth): Need-Supportive (~ 8%), Controlling (~ 27%), Autonomy-Supportive Warm (~ 10%), Mixed (~ 35%), and Low Involved (~ 20%). The Controlling profile showed high stability (86%), while the Need-Supportive profile demonstrated the highest dynamics (54%). Parental integrative emotion regulation predicted the highest probability of the Need-Supportive profile, while emotional dysregulation predicted the highest probability of the Controlling profile. Findings revealed no differences in children’s school performance across profiles, but the Need-Supportive profile was the most adaptive, fostering self-determination in parenting. The study has implications for improving involvement quality and supporting parents.",Psychology
848,,"During the recall of pictorial information, individuals typically exhibit eye movements directed toward the locations on which they focused during perceptual encoding. This behavior is thought to support memory retrieval by linking spatial information to cognitive processes. Given the known memory decline associated with healthy aging, investigating changes in eye movement behavior during recall is crucial. In the present study, we compared the eye movement patterns of older (N = 38, 65–75 years) and younger adults (N = 37, 20–30 years) during different pictorial recall tasks. Our findings indicate that both age groups looked back at the locations where the stimuli were presented; however, this effect was less pronounced in older adults. Older adults displayed less systematic and more dispersed fixations across the screen. However, despite these changes in eye behavior, we found little evidence of changes in pictorial recall performance between older and younger adults, as measured by a pictorial recall task assessing the visual details of the stimuli and an old/new recognition task. Counter to our expectations and previous findings, older adults rated their mental images as more vivid than younger adults did. This finding could suggest that older adults either perceive or interpret vividness differently, or it might reflect a subjective bias, as older adults may feel more confident about their mental image vividness. Overall, our results demonstrate that eye movement behavior during pictorial recall changes with age, which highlights the need for further investigation into the underlying mechanisms and possible consequences of this change.",Psychology

851,,"Although Machine learning (ML) models are gaining popularity in psychological research, the debate about their usefulness ranges from hype to disillusionment. The discrepancy between the hopes placed in ML and the psychometric reality is often attributed to the quality of psychological datasets, which tend to be small and subject to imprecise measurement. In this simulation study, we examined the data requirements necessary for complex ML algorithms to perform well. We compared the performance of Elastic Net Regressions and Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) under various conditions: (a) sample size, (b) number of irrelevant predictors, (c) predictor reliability, (d) effect size, and (e) nature of the data generating model (i.e., linear vs. non-linear effects). Our study had two major goals: First, we investigated whether the models achieved the maximum predictive performance (i.e., recovery of the simulated effects). Second, we examined whether the respective models were able to accurately distinguish between relevant and irrelevant predictors. Our results showed that Elastic Net Regressions with pre-specified interaction terms outperformed GBM models in almost all conditions, but still only achieved the maximum possible predictive performance under optimal conditions (N = 1,000, perfectly reliable predictors, predominantly linear effects, and an exceptionally large effect size of R² = .80), which are arguably rarely met in psychological research. We stress that data quality fundamentally limits the performance of ML models in a similar way to more traditional regression analyses and discuss the validity of comparing increasingly complex models in psychological research.",Psychology
852,,"Background: Siblings of children with disabilities experience conflicting emotions and have an increased risk of mental health problems. Several sibling interventions have been developed, but few are readily available, leaving many siblings without support. Therefore, an easily accessible, sibling serious game was developed. This study assessed the effectiveness of ‘Broodles’ in promoting quality of life, and a range of inter- and intrapersonal factors in siblings (6–9 years) of children with intellectual disabilities or visual impairments. Social validity and perceived learning outcomes were evaluated. Methods: A randomized controlled trial with a waitlist control group was conducted. In total, 107 parent-child dyads completed questionnaires at three timepoints, across 12–14 weeks. The intervention group also completed post-test interviews. Interaction effects were assessed using multilevel modelling, and thematic analysis was applied to the evaluations. Results: Significant, weak interaction effects were found on sibling negative adjustment, but only in those who completed ≥75% of the game or followed the study timeline. Regardless of group, (very) small, significant improvements over time were found on several outcomes. ‘Broodles’ was experienced as fun (80%) and helpful (79%). Perceived learning outcomes were present on the themes: ‘sibling awareness and validation’, ‘emotions and needs’, ‘coping with emotions and situations’ and ‘family interactions’. Conclusion: Although quantitative data showed small effects, qualitative data revealed a variety of learning outcomes which can contribute to siblings’ resilience, and prevention of mental health problems. To unlock its full potential, future studies should examine how adding intervention elements can enhance the intervention’s impact.",Psychology
853,,"Background:
Ketamine has emerged as a novel treatment for psychiatric disorders, particularly treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Although intravenous (IV) ketamine is not FDA-approved for TRD, esketamine, an FDA-approved therapeutic, has contributed to the widespread clinical use of off-label IV ketamine across the United States.  This phenomenon highlights the need for a comprehensive scoping review of current practices.

Study Question:
What are the current practice patterns, patient demographics, and barriers to accessing ketamine for psychiatric disorders, particularly TRD?

Data Sources:
The Web of Science, PubMed, CBM, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, University Theses, and Embase databases were searched from their inception through October 2024 for relevant studies examining ketamine use in psychiatric clinical practice. Studies addressing ketamine use in psychiatry care, provider practices, and patient outcomes were included in the analysis.

Study Design:
This scoping review mapped the landscape of ketamine utilization in psychiatric care. The review focused on provider utilization patterns (including frequency of ketamine administration, provider roles, and treatment settings), preferred administration methods (IV infusions, intramuscular injections,and other routes), and patient characteristics (age, gender, socioeconomic status, and primary psychiatric diagnoses treated). Key outcomes include provider utilization rates, economic burdens, treatment protocols, and demographic data. 

Results:
Two survey-based studies were included in this review. Intravenous (IV) administration was the most common method of administration reported in both studies, with alternative methods such as intramuscular (IM) and sublingual routes emerging in limited use. Patients receiving ketamine therapy were predominantly middle-aged (36-64 years old), with financial barriers identified as a notable obstacle due to limited insurance coverage and reliance on out-of-pocket payments. Geographic disparities underscored limited access in rural areas, invoking the need for expanded provider networks. Private clinics exhibited greater flexibility in treatment approaches compared to hospital settings, which adhered to standardized protocols. The absence of long-term outcome data and variability in treatment protocols emphasize the need for standardized practices and further research.

Conclusion:
This scoping review highlights the widespread use of ketamine for TRD, but reveals significant variability in practice patterns and accessibility barriers. Findings emphasize the need for standardized protocols, expanded insurance coverage, and further research to optimize the role of ketamine in psychiatric care.",Psychology

855,,"Objective
Adolescent suicide is a public health emergency with interpersonal factors playing a critical role in risk for suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STB). This study examined whether smartphone-based ecological momentary assessment (EMA) surveys capturing stress and social context could enhance the identification of youth at risk for STB.

Method
Adolescents ages 13-18-years old (N=207, 166 female sex) reporting depressive, anxiety, and/or substance use disorders were recruited from psychiatric outpatient programs, emergency departments, medical research registries, and social media. Participants with STB history were oversampled; 66% reported current suicidal ideation and 27% had a past-year attempt. Assessments of suicidal events (attempts, emergency department visits, hospitalizations for suicide concerns) were completed at baseline, 1-, 3-, and 6-month follow-up assessments. EMA probed momentary stress severity, affect, and recent social context (time spent with peers, family, or alone) 4-7x/day.

Results
Compared to psychiatric controls (N=64), adolescents with STB history (N=143) were more likely to report spending time alone (aOR=1.75, 95% CI=[1.15, 2.39]), less time with family (aOR=0.59, 95% CI=[0.31, 0.91]), and higher stress (d=0.28). Further, EMA of stress (aOR=1.86, 95% CI=[1.11, 3.26]) and negative affect (aOR=2.32, 95% CI=[1.34, 4.36]) were prospectively associated with suicidal events above and beyond prior STB history. 

Conclusion
These findings underscore the importance of evaluating dynamic family and peer contact among adolescents at risk for STB and highlight EMA as a potential tool for assessing interpersonal exposures related to STB risk.",Psychology

This illustrates the difficulties of understanding social contagion—the process of information (including attitudes or behaviors) spreading throughout a group—especially in relation to veganism. By understanding social contagion better, advocates can improve their diet change outreach, possibly by mastering the art of “vegan contagion.” The spread of veg*nism hasn’t been formally studied as of yet, but this study reflects on a similar behavior change that has been commonly studied: quitting smoking.  With this literature review, we examined peer influences on quitting smoking with the goal of generating hypotheses about peer-to-peer influence on veg*nism.

By understanding these critical levers of data usage, advocates and funders—both within Asia and globally—can support animal advocates in China and Southeast Asia in their efforts to protect animals in the region.",Psychology
858,,"Effort occupies a paradoxical role in human motivation: it is often avoided as aversive, yet it is also pursued for its perceived and retrospective value. While effort is frequently associated with frustration and avoidance, it is also a source of meaning, mastery, and satisfaction. This dual nature arises from effort’s role in goal-directed behavior, where the aversiveness of effort signals obstacles or limitations, while its value emerges through its association with reward, purpose, and self-improvement. We explore the complex interplay between effort’s costs and benefits across phenomenological, behavioral, and neurocognitive domains, highlighting contextual and individual factors that influence its experience. By integrating perspectives on effort avoidance, effort valuation, and its broader implications for well-being, this paper builds a comprehensive understanding of the effort paradox. We suggest that effort, despite its costs, plays a critical role in promoting persistence, growth, and meaningful engagement in life.",Psychology

However, perception and prediction blur together for objects in motion, a classic finding known as ""representational momentum"".

In six experiments, we show that this phenomenon transcends motion: Our minds make predictions that distort our memories about changes that involve no motion whatsoever, including changes in brightness and color saturation. Additionally, we use representational momentum to map the limits of automatic prediction, showing that there are no analogous effects for changes in hue. Our automatic predictions distort our memories in many domains—not just motion—and the presence or absence of these distortions expose the inner workings of perception, cognition, and memory.",Psychology
860,,"In a purely meritocratic society educational outcomes would reflect ability, and only ability. Vocabulary size is a common measure of cognitive ability that predicts educational outcomes but is confounded with socioeconomic circumstances (SEC). We ran preregistered analyses of the nationally-representative UK Millennium Cohort Study data (N=15,576), sharing all analysis code and data definitions to support follow-up and reproducibility. We show that age-5 vocabulary strongly predicted age-16 educational attainment even after adjusting for both SEC and caregiver vocabulary ability. However, the weight of evidence for the effect was lower than that for the effect of SEC. Further, larger vocabulary was most advantageous for those in middle SEC groups. This demonstrates the current limits of meritocracy in education attainment. It suggests that early language interventions are well founded but cannot by themselves be expected to counteract the effect of social inequality on life chances.",Psychology
861,,"Sharp disagreements about social issues have raised concerns about increasing societal polarization in democracies worldwide. While diversity of opinion is vital for democratic engagement and can promote innovative solutions, social science research shows that such disagreements can undermine social cohesion and erode social trust if they turn into identity-based conflicts. The present research examines the potential of norms that promote equality-based respect, dialogue, and unity (inclusivity norms) in mitigating these negative outcomes. In a pre-registered representative survey of 12,041 individuals in twelve European countries, we find that perceived inclusivity norms are associated with increased tolerance, greater willingness to collaborate, and lower tendencies to avoid people who hold opposing opinions. In most countries studied, this pattern holds for respondents with high levels of disapproval of the opposing viewpoint and stronger identification with their opinion-based group relative to society. These findings support the potential of inclusivity norms to preserve social trust and cohesion amid opinion diversity.",Psychology
862,,"Research on dyslexia and bilingualism has largely been conducted separately (Cline, 2000). This systematic review explores the interaction between bilingualism and dyslexia by summarising and synthesising studies that include bilingual dyslexic readers (DRs). The goal is to identify aspects of dyslexia that are independent of multilingual experience and to determine the most appropriate diagnostic tests for bilingual populations. We include 40 studies, categorised into three groups: studies involving only bilingual dyslexic and typical readers (TRs), studies comparing monolingual and bilingual DRs and TRs, and studies predicting poor reading in bilingual populations. Our findings indicate that rapid naming and reading impairments remain prevalent in bilingual dyslexic populations. Phonological awareness, a common deficit in dyslexia, appears to be less impaired in bilingual readers. Notably, language experience is associated with more differences in DRs than TRs, suggesting that bilingualism may interact with relevant skills more markedly in dyslexic than in typically reading individuals. In predictive studies, the high variability across studies does not allow for evidence-based recommendations for reliable diagnostic measures. Future research should focus on clearly defining the language profiles of participants and should ensure that assessments account for linguistic experience in the language of testing. Additionally, evaluations should adopt a more comprehensive and individualised approach to accurately assess bilingual readers.",Psychology
863,,"Background: To better understand heterogeneity in PTSD development and to ensure that knowledge of risk and intervention mechanisms is available for a diverse group of trauma exposed individuals, psychotraumatology needs to consider diversity in sample characteristics. 
Objective: In a comprehensive overview, we evaluated how nine diversity domains including age, socioeconomic status (SES), race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, care responsibilities, religion/worldview, mental health, physical health, and disability status were considered in prospective PTSD research. In in-depth analyses, we further investigated the assessment and representation of population groups with regard to age, SES and race/ethnicity.  
Method: Based on a systematic literature research in PubMed, Web of Science, PsycINFO, PsycArticles and PSYNDEX we included k=45 studies that prospectively assessed PTSD symptoms in trauma exposed individuals and that were previously analyzed with regard to sex and gender consideration. Information on diversity assessment and characteristics was systematically extracted and analyzed. 
Results: While age was assessed in all studies, consideration of the remaining diversity domains was insufficient, ranging from 57.8% of studies for SES to 0.0% regarding sexual orientation and care responsibilities. Our in-depth analyses showed that middle-aged, well-educated and racially non-marginalized individuals were overrepresented. 
Conclusions: Our study revealed diversity data gaps in reporting and representation, limiting the generalizability of research findings. It highlights the need to routinely assess diversity domains, whenever appropriate, as well as to further develop and establish existing instruments. Given this selection bias in naturalistic studies, strategies to attract and retain traditionally underrepresented groups in studies are necessary.",Psychology
864,,"Episodic memory, or memory for specific past experiences, can be measured in ways ranging from fully controlled laboratory paradigms to real world settings. It is unknown whether different measures of episodic memory are capturing the same construct. We examined this question in children between four and seven years (N=76), using a battery of assessments ranging from measurements of memory for mini-events presented in the lab, to measures of memory for a cartoon, and most naturalistically, recall of real-world events, i.e., autobiographical memory. Most measures of memory improved with age. After controlling for the effects of age and verbal IQ, a factor analysis revealed two distinct components of children’s memory. The first component was comprised of our lab-based measures of memory and captured the majority of variance in the data. The second component included autobiographical memory and free recall of previously seen cartoons. This dichotomy may be driven by whether memory was assessed via recall or recognition. However, it also yields evidence for the idea that lab-based tasks and more naturalistic assessments of memory may not be measuring the same underlying construct.",Psychology
865,,"With this commentary on Pinciotti et al.’s article, “Justice-based treatment considerations for identity-related OCD,” we express our unequivocal and full-throated support for the integration of anti-racist, intersectional, and justice-based treatment approaches in the field of clinical psychology. We begin by applauding the authors for their innovative work. Though calls for centering equity and justice in our field have increased in recent years, there is still a vast chasm between desire for change and the tangible advancement of specific clinical practices. Pinciotti and colleagues thus provide an important service to the field in offering concrete examples of applying justice-based practices in the treatment of a specific clinical issue (identity-related OCD) as well as in their description of broader justice-based principles that hold relevance across treatment approaches. Pinciotti and colleagues masterfully demonstrate the application of these techniques and their incorporation into an evidence-based intervention. This can serve as an exemplar for providers who are eager to incorporate elements of justice-based treatment in their existing practice but may not know where to begin.",Psychology
866,,"Background: Prenatal cannabis exposure (PCE) may be associated with increased risk of Autism Spectrum Dis-order (ASD). However, the degree that this increased risk is influenced by genetic or familial confounders is not well understood. This study evaluated whether (1) polygenic risk would predict ASD traits; (2) PCE would pre-dict ASD traits above and beyond ASD genetic risk; and (3) the association between PCE and ASD traits would be weakened once familial confounders were also controlled.
 
Method: This was a retrospective, population-based study using data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive De-velopment (ABCD) study 4.0 release. Children born between 2005- 2009 with genotypic data were included with-in the analyses. At baseline, children were between 9 and 11 years of age (M=9.92, SD=0.52) and follow-up was one year later. Mothers retrospectively reported cannabis use during pregnancy. A polygenic score (PGS) for ASD was developed using PRS-CS based on summary statistics from a genome wide association meta-analysis of 18,381 individuals with ASD and 27,969 controls. ASD traits were measured using caregiver reports on the Short Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS). Hypotheses were tested using regression models that accounted for PGS and familial confounders (propensity score). 
 
Results: PGS was associated with total SRS (β =0.09, 95% Confidence Interval [0.05, 0.13]) and all individual items on the SRS, except Focus. PCE accounted for significant variance in all measured ASD traits and total SRS above genetic risk. In models controlling for both PGS and propensity scores, PCE remained positively associated with several ASD traits and the SRS total score, but not with social communication aspects of ASD.
 
Conclusions: PCE remained positively associated with total SRS and several ASD traits, even after accounting for individual genetic risk and family confounders. Potential specificity of PCE effects on subtypes of ASD traits warrants further attention.

867,,"Introduction: Pathological/Extreme Demand Avoidance (PDA) is a behavioural profile that is defined as a persistent avoidance of demands. Those with the profile often engage in extreme behaviours to avoid even apparently innocuous demands. Since its formulation, research and interest in PDA has increased, with recent reviews capturing the peer-reviewed studies completed into the early 2020s. However, these reviews mainly focused on children and often did not include non-peer reviewed grey literature, including various master’s and doctoral theses on the topic and work conducted by PDA charities – all can be very relevant for our understanding of the behavioural profile. This review aims to update these previous reviews by including more recent evidence, including adult work and grey literature, thus illuminating what is known about PDA through current empirical work. We aim to discuss what this work tells us about how PDA is conceptualised, the terminology used in empirical work to describe it, how it is being investigated, what may drive it, how it is measured, what interventions are known, and what gaps exist in the literature.
Methods and Analysis: Using the scoping review framework proposed by Arksey and O’Malley (2005), and more recent guidance by Levac et al. (2010) and the JBI manual for evidence synthesis (Peters et al., 2024), we will collect papers that present data on PDA for review. Searches will be conducted on APA Psych Info, Embase, Medline, Web of Science and Open Aire Explore, with Google Scholar, ProQuest, OATD and other platforms used for grey literature. The terms Demand Avoidance, Pathological Demand Avoidance, Extreme Demand Avoidance, Demand Avoidance Phenomena and Rational Demand Avoidance will be searched. Screening will be conducted individually by the first two authors using the review software Covidence, with discrepancies resolved and piloting overseen by the two last authors. A similar process will be applied to data charting. Relevant findings will be discussed in relation to the stated questions.
Ethics and Dissemination: This review will not collect new data, thus ethical approval is not required. Findings will be disseminated through publication, conferences, and other forms of media.",Psychology
868,,"This study compared the language, cognition, and social-emotional development between twins and their younger singleton siblings at the ages 2, 3, 4, and 7 years. Data came from 851 sibling trios from the Twins Early Development Study (TEDS), a family cohort born in 1994-1996 in England and Wales (50.2% female; 93.2% White British). Twins performed worse than singletons in language, cognition, and social-emotional development across ages, with small to moderate effect sizes (d=0.17-0.62). An exception was language at age 7 years, when twins exceeded their singleton siblings (d=-0.35). These findings suggest that (a) twins and their singleton siblings differ in development across domains and (b) their differences in language reverse during childhood.",Psychology
869,,"This study examines how individual differences in Pavlovian learning profiles—specifically between sign-trackers and goal-trackers—shape maladaptive decision-making. Using a modified version of the Pavlovian-to-Instrumental Transfer (PIT) paradigm, we tested 60 participants to investigate whether sign-trackers display a stronger maladaptive Pavlovian bias in decision-making compared to goal-trackers. Both groups successfully learned optimal decision-making strategies, but sign-trackers deviated more frequently when presented with task-irrelevant, outcome-predictive cues, showing a pronounced reliance on suboptimal strategies.
Computational modeling revealed that this maladaptive bias stems from slower Pavlovian cue value updating (Pavlovian α) among sign-trackers, a process further linked to their heightened incentive value attribution to cues (measured via pupil dilation). These findings provide critical insights into the computational and motivational mechanisms underlying maladaptive decision-making and support the presence of a link between sign-trackers and cognitive vulnerabilities. The results carry significant implications for understanding susceptibility to addictive behaviors and other pathologies involving maladaptive cue-driven decisions.",Psychology
870,,"This study examines how coherence between environmental details and verbal learning content in immersive virtual reality (IVR) influences. It bridges research on multimedia learning and IVR-based learning environments. In a two-factor experiment, environmental details (360° immersive scene vs. 2D static scene) and content coherence (text coherent with environment vs. incoherent) were manipulated. N = 77 students explored a virtual replica of the Sistine Chapel. Measures included spatial ability and presence, enjoyment, cognitive load, knowledge acquisition and eye-tracking data. Immersive presentation of environmental details increased enjoyment and drew attention to background elements, but did not improve learning. Results further showed that incoherent content led to better learning performance, possibly due to lower intrinsic cognitive load and higher perceived enjoyment of the learning material. Spatial presence was positively correlated with enjoyment, but enjoyment did not show a direct relationship with knowledge acquisition. In fact, spatial presence was negatively correlated with learning. Eye tracking analyses validated the operationalization of coherence, revealing a distinct allocation of attention based on coherence levels. The results may be explained by the complexity of the learning environment. The regulation of coherence building may only become relevant in more complex, dynamic IVR environments where information is not presented statically and requires attentional regulation by learners. The results also show that immersive features do not guarantee better learning outcomes but may increase user enjoyment. Future research should explore dynamic IVR settings and use gaze-based process analysis to better understand how students learn in IVRs.",Psychology
871,,"A significant body of research has examined the relationships between political ideology and conspiracy beliefs. Conspiracy theories are often considered the province of “extremist” political positions. Intriguingly, however, several recent studies have demonstrated that people at the midpoint of the left-right self-placement item often displayed elevated conspiracy beliefs. The cause of this “midpoint bump” is unknown. Based on these observations, our research investigated the extent to which midpoint bumps exist in other domains. Using data from the Australian Election Study (N = 2179) and the American National Election Study (N = 8280), we conducted polynomial tests on the relationships between the left-right item and a range of social and political attitudes. We found W-shaped relationships primarily across attitudes towards the political system and immigrants. To explore the possibility that subgroups may hold anti-establishment and anti-immigrant attitudes that distinguish them from typically-moderate responders, we conducted Latent Profile Analyses on midpoint responders. In both samples, one profile represented an extreme response pattern relative to other profiles, consistent with populist attitudes. We discuss the implications of the left-right scale conflating political diversity at the midpoint for ideological measurement, as well as how it hinders understanding anti-establishment tendencies across the political spectrum.",Psychology
872,,"Assessing socioeconomic status (SES) is important but complex and requires a contextually-based approach. Using data from Namibia, Kenya, and South Africa (N = 3,920), this study aimed to create the Socio-Economic Status in Africa Scale (SESAS) for young adults. Seventeen indicators were culturally-adapted or newly developed to capture young adults’ access to resources across domains. Nine items related to asset ownership, infrastructure access, and education intercorrelated, had good internal consistency, configural measurement invariance, and alignment results that support their use for cross-cultural comparisons between Namibia, Kenya, and South Africa. The African-specific resources (farm/land, livestock) appeared to capture urban-rural lifestyle. This scale-development approach implied a reflective conceptualization of SES. We also considered reconceptualizing SES as socioeconomic conditions and investigated indicator-outcome associations. Five indicators showed significant associations but were country-specific and not suitable for a comparative measure. We propose the SESAS as a new SES measure for young adults in sub-Saharan Africa.",Psychology
873,,"Family therapy is recommended as the first-line treatment for anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa in adolescents. There is also emerging evidence for family therapy as a treatment for avoidant restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID). The aim of this article is to provide an up-to-date overview of the family therapy approach to treating adolescent eating disorders. Family therapy emerged in the 1980s as an evidence-based approach to treating adolescent eating disorders. A core aspect of the treatment is an early emphasis on parents supporting their child to achieve behavioural change, whilst later helping the child to take responsibility for their eating. The treatment is supported by evidence from randomized controlled trials, but there have been relatively few trials comparing family therapy with individual treatments. To improve the evidence base for family therapy, we recommend greater involvement of people with lived experience of eating disorders in research; the development of ‘modular’ treatment manuals; a focus on improving the validity and reliability of measures; and greater use of alternatives to randomised controlled trials, including experimental studies and use of real-world data.",Psychology
874,,"Being imitated has profound effects on social affect and behavior, but it is still unclear how it produces these effects. According to one view the effects are grounded in covert movement simulations and therefore require the movements of the individuals to be bodily congruent. Yet, imitation could also have its positive effects because of the rewarding experience of perceiving temporal contingencies between one’s own and others’ movements, implying that these effects would also occur if the imitator’s movements are temporally contingent, but not bodily congruent. 

In two experiments, we assessed whether bodily congruency is necessary for increasing empathy and prosocial behavior, or whether temporal contingency alone can also produce such effects. Participants made spontaneous joystick movements while engaging in a feigned webcam interaction with two confederates, one of whom made imitative movements, while the other (the control actor) made unrelated movements. In two experimental groups, we varied whether the imitator made bodily congruent or temporally contingent movements. 

Participants reported more affiliation to the congruent actor compared to the control actor, and conformed more to this actor’s judgments. Besides, participants showed a higher skin conductance response (SCR) when perceiving the congruent actor in pain, and favored this actor in prosocial behavior, with increase in SCR predicting whether the imitator was favored. Imitation that was merely temporally contingent did not evoke such effects. Together, these findings suggest that the social effects of imitation seem grounded in motor and affective resonance processes, and that they can be selectively targeted at specific interaction partners.",Psychology
875,,"Background: Given trends towards greater life expectancy, there is an increasing need to promote healthy ageing and add quality and value to older adults’ lives, however the evidence regarding the effects on overall health and wellbeing has not been synthesised. Active lifestyles may provide diverse health and wellbeing benefits for older adults in terms of maintaining or improving their physical, psychological, and social functions. This systematic review evaluates whether and how different types of interventions within community-based settings might benefit specific aspects of older adults’ health and wellbeing.
Methods: PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus and Web of Science were systematically searched in January 2022 for experimental studies (including randomised controlled trials, non-randomised controlled trials, and quasi-experimental studies) exploring health and wellbeing benefits of community-based activities in older adults. A total of 12,707 sources were identified through database searches with 183 retained for full screening. Final inclusion was based on the following eligibility criteria: (1) participants were generally healthy and predominantly independent community-dwelling older adults aged 60 and above; (2) interventions were based in real-world settings, e.g., dance, art and technology classes, etc. held in publicly-accessible facilities; (3) pre-/post-interventions assessed at least one outcome in physical health, psychological wellbeing or social connections; (4) control groups were used, including passive and active control groups or groups that received a different type of intervention; (5) experimental studies followed a quantitative research design.
Results: Of the 183 studies considered for full-text screening, 56 were retained in the final review. Thirty-eight studies included at least one physical health outcome, with 32 reporting positive effects of real-world interventions. Of the 40 studies that considered psychological wellbeing, 29 reported intervention benefits. Eight studies measured social connections, with all but 1 reporting positive effects.
Discussion: The benefits of real-world interventions were reported across a range of outcomes, particularly in terms of reducing depression or anxiety, or improving physical functioning, sleep quality and social participation. However, heterogeneity in interventions, sample design, duration and dosage suggest that more research is needed to support the effects of duration and dosage of intervention exposure. As real-world interventions more closely resemble the way in which older people engage in activities, evidence of their effectiveness in promoting health and wellbeing should inform preventative healthcare provision and policymaking.",Psychology
876,,"This study examines how the cognitive and non-cognitive components of parental education influence two dimensions of offspring mental health difficulties (externalising and internalising). We used data from 3,228 mother-father-child trios from the UK-based Millennium Cohort Study to decompose parental genetic influences into genetic transmission and genetic nurture routes (i.e., parental genetics influencing offspring via environmental pathways). For externalising, we uncover striking developmental patterns: genetic transmission increases from early childhood (3 years) to adolescence (14 years) for both cognitive and noncognitive components; conversely, genetic nurture effects decrease over time. For internalising, effects remain consistent across development. For both early externalising and internalising, the intergenerational transmission of the cognitive component mainly happens via genetic transmission whereas noncognitive effects mainly occur via genetic nurture. These results suggest that the intergenerational transmission of educational attainment involves component-specific and developmentally sensitive genetic and environmental pathways, with implications for developmentally informed intervention strategies.",Psychology
877,,"Research on mental health has traditionally separated the study of illbeing—disorder and problems—and wellbeing—life satisfaction and positive affect. While previous reviews of studies primarily employing self-report scales indicate that illbeing and wellbeing are distinct yet interconnected constructs, a deeper examination of their relationship is lacking. This perspective article from the PROMENTA Research Center offers a review and synthesis of findings on the joint and distinct nature of illbeing and wellbeing across multiple levels of analysis. Adopting an interdisciplinary approach, we integrate genetic, biological, developmental, psychosocial, societal, cultural, and intervention-based perspectives. Our review reveals substantial genetic overlap and some similar biological underpinnings for illbeing and wellbeing. In contrast, environmental factors and societal changes often have divergent impacts. We propose that future research should systematically assess both positive and negative aspects of mental health to discern their shared and unique determinants, predictors, mechanisms, and consequences.",Psychology
878,,"Introduction: The conjunction of physical frailty and cognitive impairment without dementia is described as Cognitive Frailty (CF). Indications that CF is potentially reversible have led to proposals that risk factors, symptoms or mechanisms of CF would be appropriate targets for interventions for prevention, delay or reversal. However, no study has brought experts together across sectors to determine targets, content or mode of interventions, and most resources on interventions are from the perspective of academic or clinical researchers only. This international Delphi consensus study brings together experts from academic and clinical research, lay people with lived experience of CF, informal carers, and professional care practitioners/clinicians.
Methods: Three rounds of Delphi study were held to discern which factors and statements were agreed upon by the whole sample and which generated different views in those with differing expertise. A scoping review and Round 1 (29 participants) were used to gather initial statements. In Round 2, 58 people responded to statements and open text items, comprising 7 lab-based researchers, 27 researchers working with people, 14 people with lived experience or informal family carers, and 10 professional carers/clinicians. Percent agreement and qualitative responses were analysed to provide a final set of statements which were checked by 38 respondents in Round 3.
Results: Analysis of Round 2 quantitative data provided 74 statements on which there was at least 70% agreement and qualitative data produced a further 24 statements. These were combined to provide 90 statements for Round 3. There was Consensus for 89 of the statements. A few differences between the groups were observed at both stages.
Discussion and Conclusion: The consensus for statements associated with CF interventions provides a useful first step in defining health promotion activities and interventions. Given the prevalence and potential disability caused by CF in older populations, the consensus statements represent expert opinion that is inter-sectoral and will inform public health policies to support implementation of evidence-based prevention and intervention plans. This study is an important step towards changing current approaches, by including all stakeholders from the outset. Outcomes can be used to feed into co-creation of interventions for cognitive frailty.",Psychology
879,,"In recent years, scientific interest in sensory processing sensitivity (SPS), a personality trait that captures inter-individual differences in the processing, perception and response to both negative and positive stimuli, has grown exponentially. This review summarises the recent literature on SPS to discuss a number of central themes, including its assessment, relation to other personality traits, effects on cognition and mental health, and its (neuro)biological basis. We also identify existing knowledge gaps and capitalise on a general theory of brain function, predictive processing, to provide a novel mechanistic account of SPS. This account offers a unified explanation for the phenotypic consequences of enhanced sensory sensitivity and can serve as a guide for future research.",Psychology
880,,"In complex environments, the space of possible plans is vast. Generating a good plan therefore requires judicious selection of which parts of the plan space to mentally explore. Drawing on past studies of human exploration, we propose that mental exploration might invoke similar mechanisms. In particular, we test the hypothesis that mental exploration during planning is uncertainty-driven, such that people will exhibit a tendency to explore parts of the plan space that have high epistemic uncertainty. We developed a route-planning task, displayed as a binary tree, where participants were instructed to collect as many treats (rewards) as possible by traversing the tree. By separating the planning and execution phases, we encouraged participants to externalize their planning process. We manipulated uncertainty by varying the number of potential future states available from each current state. Across two studies, the data suggest that people preferred to explore options with more successor states after controlling for value differences, supporting the uncertainty-driven planning hypothesis. We also found that uncertainty played a larger role during the planning phase than during the execution phase, consistent with the hypothesis that the uncertainty effect primarily reflects a property of human planning algorithms rather than an intrinsic preference for uncertainty.",Psychology
881,,"Studies on serial dependence demonstrated that perceptual reports exhibit systematic biases in relation to the task-irrelevant previous stimulus. Does this phenomenon reflect distortions in the stimulus representation itself or biases in post-perceptual decision-making? To answer this question, the present study investigated how quickly the decision for a new stimulus is initiated by measuring response initiation time (RTI) and how the decision unfolds over time by measuring response trajectories for the mouse reports in orientation delayed estimation tasks. We hypothesized that the two variables (i.e., RTI and response trajectory) should be independent of the previous stimulus if the bias is driven by distortions in the representation itself, whereas they should vary systematically in relation to the previous stimulus if the bias is driven by post-perceptual decision processes. In two experiments, we found that 1) RTI was slower when the current stimulus was similar to the previous stimulus, indicating that the decision was more difficult for such trials, and 2) mouse reports started from the opposite side of the previous stimulus, indicating that the decision was executed by avoiding the previous stimulus. Critically, similar decisional dynamics were observed irrespective of the direction of serial dependence. Together, these results provide converging evidence that both repulsive and attractive serial dependence are driven by processes that integrate previous stimuli into the decision for a new stimulus, placing significant constraints on the theories that assume that serial dependence reflects the distortions in the representation itself.",Psychology
882,,"Despite the popularity of structural equation modeling in psychological research,
accurately evaluating the fit of these models to data is still challenging. Using fixed fit
index cutoffs is error-prone due to the fit indices’ dependence on various features of the
model and data (“nuisance parameters”). Nonetheless, applied researchers mostly rely on
fixed fit index cutoffs, neglecting the risk of falsely accepting (or rejecting) their model.
With the goal of developing a broadly applicable method that is almost independent of
nuisance parameters, we introduce a machine learning (ML)-based approach to evaluate
the fit of multi-factorial measurement models. We trained an ML model based on 173
model and data features that we extracted from 1,323,866 simulated data sets and models
fitted by means of confirmatory factor analysis (i.e., training observations). We evaluated
the performance of the ML model based on 1,659,386 test observations unseen during
model training. The ML model performed very well in detecting model (mis-)fit in the
majority of conditions, thereby outperforming the fixed fit index cutoffs by Hu and Bentler
(1999) across the board. Only minor misspecifications—single neglected residual
correlations (and cross-loadings), in particular—proved to be challenging to detect. From
this proof-of-concept study we conclude that ML is very promising in the context of model
fit evaluation.",Psychology
883,,"A short period of eye-tracking can produce large amounts of data, making analysis challenging, particularly for clinical applications. Automated methods for extracting basic oculomotor features of saccades, fixation, or blinking are available. For more in-depth oculomotor analysis, manual cleaning and processing is often required. This is time-consuming and variable across individuals and over time, which limits scalability and clinical utility, even if identified oculomotor markers have high potential clinical significance. Automation provides an opportunity to reduce manual labour and improve replicability and precision through algorithmic approaches. Here we outline the design and validation of our SacLab Toolbox for processing data from well-established oculomotor paradigms commonly used in clinical research such as prosaccade, antisaccade, and smooth pursuit tasks. For prosaccade and antisaccade tasks, results showed good agreement between algorithmic and manual cleaning regarding which trials were to be included (88% for prosaccade and 92% for antisaccade with F1-scores of 0.90 and 0.76, respectively). The toolbox was also tested on data for both tasks from an independent laboratory with a different manual cleaning protocol, and the level of agreement remained high (83% for prosaccade and 88% for antisaccade with F1-scores of 0.90 and 0.88, respectively). The extent of concordance for the metrics extracted in both methods is discussed. The predominant reason for discrepancy between the manual process and our toolbox related to human error in the manual process. Overall, the results provide support for the benefits of this toolbox for these eye-tracking tasks in clinical and research applications.",Psychology
884,,"People are lazy. Although there are important exceptions, we prefer to exert less rather than more effort to gain the same reward. People are also social, and we often exert effort with others around, for example at the office, library, or cafe. Here, we ask if human laziness is shaped by those around us. Are we less lazy when we’re around hard-workers? Are we more lazy when we’re around slackers? Across eight studies (N = 1473), we gave people a demand-selection task where they repeatedly chose between a hard or easy task. Our results revealed that participants exerted significantly more effort after learning that previous participants consistently chose the harder task, compared to a control group who received no information about others' choices. Interestingly, participants who were told that others typically opted for the easier task, did not exert less effort than the control group. These results indicate that while others can help us resist laziness and inspire us to work harder, there appears to be a limit to our laziness. We might be effort misers, but this miserliness has a ceiling.",Psychology
885,,"Early childhood poverty is associated with neurodevelopmental differences, but causal evidence linking income to brain development is sparse. In the present study, we examine whether four years of monthly unconditional cash transfers to mothers experiencing low income cause differences in their preschoolers’ brain activity. Shortly after giving birth, mothers were randomized to receive $333/month or $20/month. We find no impact on our primary preregistered outcome (an aggregated index of mid-to-high-frequency brain activity) or our secondary preregistered outcome frontal gamma power. In additional analyses that were part of our pre-registered analytic plan, we find that preschoolers in the high-cash gift group have higher alpha power than those in the low-cash gift group, but no differences in theta, beta, or gamma power. These findings suggest monthly unconditional cash transfers may have impacts on children’s alpha power during the preschool years, although this evidence needs further investigation and replication.",Psychology
886,,"A deceleration in heart rate (HR), along with a lengthening of the time between heartbeats, has been associated with attentional engagement. Here, we investigated the feasibility of using changes in HR to estimate attentional engagement during spoken language processing. Prior fMRI evidence suggests that speech processing of an unknown language is more cognitively demanding; we thus designed an experiment to replicate this finding through HR. In an active listening task, we measured cardiac responses in 66 native English speakers (34 monolingual, 32 simultaneous bilingual), who listened to spoken passages in two conditions: one in a familiar language and the other unfamiliar. Results demonstrated significant condition effects on participants’ BPM (beats per minute) and IBI (interbeat interval). Listening to an unfamiliar language induced significantly lower BPM and a trend of longer IBI, particularly during the first five out of nine trials. Our finding aligns with previous neuroimaging evidence that processing an unfamiliar language demands more attention than a familiar one. Our analysis also revealed that the effects were independent of participants’ bilingual experience or language and cognitive abilities. Overall, our results indicate that HR measurement has a potential in psycholinguistic and cognitive research.",Psychology
887,,"Developmental differences between children growing up in poverty and their higher-income peers are frequently reported. However, the extent to which such differences are caused by differences in family income is unclear. To study the causal role of income on children’s development, the Baby’s First Years randomized control trial provided families with monthly unconditional cash transfers. One thousand racially and ethnically diverse mothers with incomes below the U.S. federal poverty line were recruited from postpartum wards in 2018-19, and randomized to receive either $333/month or $20/month for the first several years of their children’s lives. After the first four years of the intervention (n=891), we find no statistically significant impacts of the cash transfers on four preregistered primary outcomes (language, executive function, social-emotional problems, and high-frequency brain activity) nor on three secondary outcomes (visual processing/spatial perception, pre-literacy, maternal reports of developmental diagnoses). Possible explanations for these results are discussed.",Psychology
888,,"Impairments in reward-related behavior are characteristic of major depressive disorder and closely linked with anhedonia. While previous research has suggested a negative relationship between reward-related behavior and symptoms of depression or anhedonia, findings across clinical and non-clinical studies are mixed. To investigate this relationship, we conducted three online studies with a combined sample of over 600 participants. Participants completed reinforcement learning tasks which involved the selection of either the more rewarding response or more rewarding stimulus. Contrary to expectations, we consistently observed a positive association between reinforcement learning performance and anhedonia symptoms across all studies: an exploratory study, a preregistered replication, and an independent dataset utilizing a different learning task. Depression symptoms overall showed only weak positive associations with performance. Our results contrast with the assumption of a negative association between reward-related task behavior and symptoms of depression or anhedonia. Instead, our findings in large non-selective samples suggest that anhedonia symptoms can be positively associated with reward-guided behavior.",Psychology
889,,"Introduction
Aspirin is increasingly recommended for colorectal cancer prevention for people with Lynch syndrome, who are at higher risk. Before starting aspirin, patients should be reviewed by a healthcare professional for contraindications. We conducted interviews to explore the views of people with Lynch syndrome and healthcare professionals on aspirin for cancer prevention. While open data sharing is increasingly implemented for quantitative research, it is less likely to be adopted for qualitative data. We aimed to create and share a qualitative dataset of the interview transcripts in a restricted access repository.

Methods
We interviewed 15 people with Lynch syndrome, and 23 healthcare professionals. Healthcare professionals included general practitioners (GPs), community pharmacists, genetic counsellors, and specialist hospital clinicians (e.g., genetics, gastroenterology). The interview schedule was informed by the Theoretical Domains Framework. Interviews were conducted over video or telephone.

Results
Participants could consent to their anonymised interview transcript being deposited in a restricted repository, with access limited to people using the data for non-commercial research, learning or teaching purposes. Those who did not consent could still participate in the interview. Several transcripts were removed due to identifiability concerns. In total, we deposited 12 transcripts with people with Lynch syndrome, and eight transcripts with GPs. 

Discussion
To safeguard participants’ identities, we fully anonymised the dataset. While this acted to protect participants’ identities, it also potentially reduced its usability due to the removal of rich contextual detail. When sharing qualitative data, it is important to balance confidentiality with data reusability.",Psychology
890,,"Background
Previous studies have shown that individuals with substance use disorder (iSUD) often show diminished motivation toward seeking and adhering to treatment resulting in a higher relapse rate. One important cognitive correlate of substance use behavior and treatment seeking in iSUD is their ability to adaptatively regulate emotion regulation. This randomized, placebo-controlled study assessed the impact of up- and downregulation of the left and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) via transcranial direct current electrical stimulation (tDCS) on cognitive emotion regulation as well as treatment motivation in iSUD. 
Methods
Thirty male iSUDs were randomly assigned to the experimental (n=15) or placebo (n=15) groups. The experimental group underwent 15 sessions of anodal left and cathodal right dlPFC stimulation (2 mA, 20 minutes), while the placebo group received sham stimulation over the same period. Assessments of readiness, eagerness, motivation for treatment, and cognitive emotion regulation were conducted pre-and post-intervention. 
Results
Results showed that simultaneous upregulation and downregulation of the left and right dlPFC significantly boosted motivation for change and treatment in individuals with iSUD. This intervention improved participants' recognition of issues related to their substance use and reduced ambivalence about it. Additionally, it enhanced adaptive cognitive emotion regulation strategies in iSUD. 
Conclusions
Modulation of the prefrontal-subcortical network via dlPFC tDCS can help iSUD to improve adaptive emotion regulation strategies thereby boosting motivation for treatment seeking. Cognitive control interventions, via noninvasive brain stimulation, are a promising approach for cognitively and motivationally preparing iSUD for treatment-seeking and reducing substance use behavior.",Psychology
891,,"Illusions are entertaining, but they are also a useful diagnostic tool in cognitive science, philosophy, and neuroscience. A typical illusion shows a gap between how something ‘really is’ and how something ‘appears to be’, and this gap helps us understand the mental processing that lead to how something appears to be. Illusions are also useful for investigating artificial systems, and much research has examined whether computational models of perceptions fall prey to the same illusions as people. Here, I invert the standard use of perceptual illusions to examine basic processing errors in current vision language models. I present these models with illusory-illusions, neighbors of common illusions that should not elicit processing errors. These include such things as perfectly reasonable ducks, crooked
lines that truly are crooked, circles that seem to have different sizes because they are, in fact, of different sizes, and so on. I show that many current vision language systems mistakenly see these illusion-illusions as illusions. I suggest that such failures are part of broader failures already discussed in the literature.",Psychology
892,,"Many people worldwide want to be less neurotic. As lower levels of neuroticism predict a range of positive life outcomes, including health, work success, and relationship quality, interventions that help people to become less neurotic could have wide ranging impacts. This study protocol describes the rationale and design of the CHILL Study (Changing How I Live Life) that aims to evaluate the effects of a smartphone-based intervention to reduce neuroticism in the general public. The CHILL Study comprises four survey assessments spread over 5 months, a 6-week intervention phase, and two 1-week experience sampling phases without interventions. During the intervention phase, participants who wanted to become less neurotic were randomized to four different treatment groups. These treatment groups differed in the employed intervention strategies that target different aspects and levels of neuroticism. The CHILL Study moves beyond existing research on volitional personality change by testing which strategies most effectively decrease neuroticism and evaluating the longevity and generalizability of intervention-induced neuroticism change via peer-reports, implicit personality assessments, and a 7-week follow-up period. The goals of the CHILL Study are to generate an effective method for decreasing neuroticism and facilitating the development of a comprehensive theory of neuroticism change.",Psychology
893,,"Research has consistently linked preschool child externalizing behaviors with elevated parental stress. Prior studies have highlighted the role of parenting behaviors and parental cognitions, such as self-efficacy beliefs, in mediating this relationship. However, less attention has been given to the possibility that children’s externalizing behaviors may evoke attentional and memory biases in parents, leading them to disproportionately focus on or recall their child’s negative behaviors, thereby contributing to stress. Cognitive biases are recognized mechanisms underlying stress processes. The current study examined (a) whether parental attention and memory biases mediate the relationship between child externalizing behaviors and parental stress, and (b) differences between mothers and fathers in these cognitive pathways (actor effects), as well as potential crossover effects between parents (partner effects). The sample comprised 43 heterosexual couples with at least one child aged 3 to 6 years. Using an actor-partner interdependence model extended to mediation, the results indicate that memory biases—but not attentional biases—mediate the relationship between child externalizing behaviors and parental stress, particularly for fathers. Fathers were more likely to recall their child’s negative emotions and behaviors, which contributed to higher stress. No significant crossover effects were observed between mothers and fathers. These findings suggest that interventions, particularly those targeting memory bias modification, may be especially beneficial for fathers by addressing early cognitive schemas related to their child’s behavior.",Psychology
894,,"Psychosocial research with lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer (LGBTQ+) parent families has been pivotal in challenging societal prejudice on LGBTQ+ parenthood and advancing family-related human rights. Paradoxically, this impeded the field in maturing theoretically, as these structurally stigmatizing contexts necessitated, in part, comparative research designs. As a result, minority-specific, within-group experiences that have been formalized as main drivers of LGBTQ+ health and well-being at the individual level – including exposure to structural stigma (i.e., hostile legal environments, prejudicial societal attitudes) and minority stress (i.e., identity-based stress resulting from systematic oppression) – lack theoretical integration within LGBTQ+ family contexts. 
This thesis addresses this gap through four primary aims: (i) synthesizing evidence on structural stigma exposure in LGBTQ+ parent families, (ii) synthesizing evidence on minority stress exposure in these families, (iii) providing a concomitant test of minority stress and structural stigma exposure in LGBTQ+ parent families, and (iv) developing a novel Family Minority Stress Model based on this evidence that extends minority stress theory to the family level, integrating core theories and perspectives from family science and LGBTQ+ health and family research. A fifth aim transcends these objectives: (v) Moving LGBTQ+ parent family research forward by honoring its legacy through incorporating advanced statistical and research synthesis techniques as well as open science principles. 
Chapter 1 presents a mixed-methods systematic review (55 studies, 1999-2020) synthesizing qualitative and quantitative evidence on the impact of sexual orientation laws on same-gender parent families as a notable exemplification of structural stigma exposure in LGBTQ+ parent families. It introduces a novel Legal Vulnerability Model that formalizes the findings of this synthesis. Chapters 2 and 3 develop a blueprint for a comprehensive research synthesis on minority stress in LGBTQ+ parent families and provide results of the main analysis: A multiverse-based, meta-analytic systematic review on associations between minority stress (on the individual-, couple-, and family-level) and key outcomes for parents, children, and the family system (43 studies, 1982-2022, 3803 families, 3552 models), showing that minority stress across all levels is linked to outcomes in parents, children, and the family system. Chapter 4 provides a concomitant test of minority stress and structural stigma exposure – both stratified across multiple levels of the family system – for LGBTQ+ parents from 19 European countries. It introduces non-linear, machine learning based techniques to the field to overcome methodological obstacles within quantitative, intersectionality-informed investigations. The thesis concludes with the introduction of the Family Minority Stress Model, which formalizes structural and personal experiences of marginalization within LGBTQ+ parent families. 
Taken together, this thesis integrates the empirical basis with a theoretical formalization of understanding experiences of marginalization within LGBTQ+ parent families, holding implications for research, policy, and practice.

896,,"Perceiving the number of objects in a scene is fundamental to human behaviour and mathematics. Standard numerosity experiments assume that brief stimuli block higher cognitive processes, implying that the signature characteristics of human numerosity estimation—such as exact enumeration of small numbers, underestimation of large numbers, and scalar variability (Weber’s law)—arise from specialised sensory representations. Here we challenge this century-old assumption and find that it does not hold. Combining qualitative, correlational, and experimental methods, we provide evidence that several estimation signatures, previously attributed to specialised sensory representations, likely arise from general cognitive processes. We conducted standard numerosity estimation experiments with brief (100 ms) dot patterns and visual masking. In interviews, participants reported using common cognitive processes, including comparing to previous examples and counting from visual memory. Quantitative surveys confirmed that the reported processes correlated with their expected estimation signatures. Preregistered experiments further validated several predictions for how the processes affect their corresponding signatures. These results call for a re-evaluation of current models of numerical cognition and the development of new experimental methods to better understand how numerosity is represented and processed in sensory circuits.",Psychology

898,,"Previous research has often portrayed first-generation college students through a deficit lens, depicting them as lacking in skills, knowledge, or potential compared to continuing-generation students. It, however, remains unknown how first-generation and continuing-generation students perceive themselves with respect to their own goals and obligations. Who do they want to be and to what extent do they think of themselves as meeting their own goals and obligations? To answer these questions, we assessed students’ ideal and ought selves, as well as self-discrepancies, based on Higgins’s theory (1987), in a relatively large sample of students in the US (N = 1244) across three waves. Overall, we found no differences between first-generation and continuing-generation students’ ideal and ought selves and self-discrepancies. Responses were strikingly similar: Being kind, smart, and happy were among both groups’ top mentioned ideal and ought self-traits. Furthermore, both groups on average rated themselves as relatively close to their ideal and ought selves (scale-points around four on ideal selves and five on ought selves, respectively, on a seven-point scale). Despite common deficit-narratives, first-generation students did not think of themselves as being further away from their aspired selves than continuing-generation students.",Psychology
899,,"During the last decennia, research in the context of distressing life events mainly investigated aspects of negative mental health. In recent years, however, aspects of positive mental health started to receive more and more attention. Accordingly, the current study investigated the relationship between distressing life events and both factors, specifically positive mental health (PMH), satisfaction with life (SWL), subjective happiness (SH) as well as depression, anxiety, and stress. The present sample included N = 426 students who took part in a large online study testing protective and risk factors in the context of mental health, with the present study reporting secondary analyses of these data. Correlational analyses revealed that experiencing a distressing life event, compared to not having experienced such an event, was associated with lower levels of PMH and SWL, and higher levels of depression, anxiety, and stress, and post-hoc group comparisons supported this pattern. SH, however, was not a correlate in this context. Correlational analyses conducted in only those who had experienced a distressing life event revealed that the higher levels of current distress due to the event, the lower levels of PMH, SWL, and SH, and the higher levels of depression, anxiety, and stress. In sum, lower levels of positive mental health co-occurred with higher levels of negative mental health following the experience of a distressing life event, suggesting that promoting mental health may be an important preventative target in at-risk groups.",Psychology
900,,"Background: Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) has a chronic course. However, limited longitudinal research exists on whether adults with OCD tend to maintain the same cluster of symptoms and how those symptoms may change over time. The present study aimed to examine the stability of primary OCD symptoms across 5 years and describe how symptoms change within individuals.
Methods: 107 treatment-seeking adults with primary OCD participated in a naturalistic prospective study on the course of OCD. Primary obsessions and compulsions were assessed using the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale at baseline, year 2, and year 5. Markov transition probabilities were calculated to assess the likelihood of symptom change from one of the nine primary obsession categories and seven compulsion categories to another at follow-up. 
Results: Symptom stability varied across categories. Contamination, hoarding, symmetry, and responsibility for harm obsessions were generally stable, along with hoarding, cleaning, and checking compulsions. Conversely, somatic, aggressive, religious, sexual, and miscellaneous obsessions tended to change, along with repeating, counting, and ordering/arranging compulsions. Aggressive, religious, and sexual obsessions most often switched to one of the other two categories at follow-up. Overall, OCD symptom stability decreased over longer follow-up periods. 
Limitations: Symptom stability was only assessed between baseline and years 2 and 5. Therefore, possible changes between years 2 and 5 remain unclear.
Conclusions: OCD symptoms are relatively stable over time; however, specific symptoms may be more likely to vary. Future research should investigate factors underlying stable and unstable symptoms, as well as the impact of treatment on symptom stability.",Psychology
901,,"Mental simulation effects, tested through sentence-picture verification task, suggest that understanding a sentence can reactivate related perceptual experiences, supporting embodied cognition theory. This study investigates whether Traditional Chinese sortal classifiers amplify these mental simulations during reading. Two contrasting linguistic hypotheses are explored: the coercion hypothesis and the profiling hypothesis. The coercion hypothesis suggests that sortal classifiers impose contextually compatible meanings on nouns, potentially amplifying mental simulation even when classifiers are incongruent with the inherent semantics of the noun. In contrast, the profiling hypothesis proposes that sortal classifiers highlight existing features of nouns, implying that mental simulation amplification would only occur with congruent classifiers.
Experiment 1 (Amplification Test) indicated the mental simulation effects of specific classifiers and no classifiers, but only no classifiers reached significant level. Experiment 2 (Coercion Test) falsified the coercion hypothesis that no probe types cause significant effect. Given that the profiling hypothesis is yet to have positive evidence, the current findings revealed that linguistic theory needed to recognize the distinct nature of general classifiers from that of specific classifiers. In addition to the numerals and animacy of object nouns, we discussed that the nature of general classifiers should be considered in future improvement.",Psychology
902,,"Reward-predictive items capture attention even when they are irrelevant to current goal. While previous studies suggest that value-driven attention generalizes to items sharing critical reward-associated features (e.g., red), recent findings propose an alternative generalization mechanism based on context-dependent feature relationships (e.g., redder). Here, we examined whether the relational coding of reward-associated features is commonly utilized across different learning contexts, particularly those engaging different attention modes (singleton search vs. feature-specific search) and varying levels of stimulus similarity (low vs. high target-distractor similarity). Focusing on value-driven attention based on feature relationships, our results showed that singleton search training led to value-driven relational attention that was independent of target-distractor similarity (Experiment 1a and 1b, n = 40 each). In contrast, feature-specific search training produced value-driven relational attention only when the target was dissimilar to the distractors, but not when they were similar (Experiment 2a and 2b, n = 40 each). These findings suggest a key role of the precision of target selection during reward learning in shaping value-driven attentional mechanisms. When the learning task required only coarse selection (e.g., singleton search or feature-specific search among dissimilar items), a relational code for reward-associated feature was formed; however, when fine selection was necessary (e.g., feature-specific search among similar items), a more precise code was utilized.",Psychology
903,,"We typically process verbal information through individual sensory channels: visual (reading), auditory (listening), or tactile (Braille), although these modalities can also be combined (e.g., reading and listening simultaneously). Inclusive educational technology, such as voice-to-text transcription (VTT), enhances comprehension, particularly for individuals with low auditory discrimination and attention deficits. In this project, we used eye-tracking to analyze eye movements during reading in visual and dual modes (visual + auditory). Using the Tobii Spark system and Tobii Pro Lab software, participants read two texts of similar difficulty in both modes. After reading, they completed a comprehension test. The results obtained from 32 participants (aged 16-53) show that fixation rate and reading comprehension increase with age. Furthermore, the fixation rate is higher in the visual modality than in the dual modality. Our preliminary results show no significant differences in reading comprehension when comparing both modalities. One student with dyslexia greatly benefited from the dual modality during the experiment and also during an exam with 50% adaptation in dual modality, suggesting a promising line for future research.",Psychology
904,,"Local fit evaluation inspects the discrepancy between model-implied and observed correlation elements to identify areas of strain. A discrepancy less than 0.10 is a common benchmark for acceptably close local fit. However, the raw correlation scale includes nonlinearities and restrictions due to bounded endpoints, variance distortions, and dependencies due to positive definiteness. Consequently, a fixed criterion like 0.10 on the correlation scale can apply a different level of precision to different correlation matrix elements. To address this, we adapt the Opdyke distribution from finance to local fit evaluation. This distribution operates on the hyperspherical decomposition of a correlation matrix, which allows each element to have an independent univariate distribution. Importantly, this distribution encodes all correlation-scale restrictions. This permits expressing correlation discrepancies in terms of relative percentiles of an Opdyke distribution, which is more consistent, less heuristic, and can better account for correlation-scale restrictions than conventional fixed benchmarks.",Psychology
905,,"There is nothing humans have more experience with than their own perception. Accordingly, one may expect that people would be intimately familiar with their perceptual abilities. Here, we demonstrate that, in fact, humans have limited insight into their own perception. We designed a 46-item questionnaire with forced-choice questions regarding perceptual tasks that most people have extensive experience with. For each question, after indicating their response, participants (N=200) rated their confidence. We found that six questions featured below-chance performance, such that participants consistently picked the wrong responses. Further, for two of these questions, we observed a significantly negative confidence-accuracy correlation, such that participants who had higher confidence were more likely to be wrong. In addition to these six questions, there were another three that featured chance-level performance. A total of 24 questions featured confidence-accuracy correlations indistinguishable from zero. Moreover, average confidence stayed roughly constant for questions when considering the most challenging questions (24 out of the 43 non-catch questions). These results demonstrate that extensive experience alone is insufficient for metacognitive knowledge into our perception and suggest that the working of our perceptual systems can only be inferred by cognitive analysis instead of by direct access to the underlying mechanisms.",Psychology
906,,"It is widely acknowledged that failing to account for non-independence in data can bias statistical estimates and that national-level data often exhibit such non-independence. In our recent paper, we show that, despite this awareness, most analyses of cross-national variation in psychological values or economic indicators do not make any attempt to control for non-independence, and for those that do, most methods deployed do little to reduce bias in simulated datasets with non-independence due to proximity or shared cultural ancestry. We further show that reanalysing a small sample of published datasets using the best performing methods from our simulations can appreciably change parameter estimates. In a commentary on our paper, Akaliyski highlights potential issues with our study design, distinguishes between different sources of confounding that can arise from non-independence, and proposes causal models where controlling for non-independence might actually bias, rather than help, inference. For these reasons, Akaliyski argues that controlling for non-independence should not be the default analytic choice in cross-national research. We appreciate this commentary on our work. It is useful to discuss these methodological issues in more detail to improve the rigour of cross-national research. That said, we feel that the commentary misinterprets our argument in places and overstates potential concerns.",Psychology
907,,"Smartphone sensors can continuously and unobtrusively collect clinically relevant behavioral data, allowing for more precise symptom monitoring in clinical and research settings.  However, progress in identifying behavioral markers of psychopathology from smartphone sensors has been stalled by research on diagnostic categories that are heterogenous and have many non-specific symptoms.  This study addresses these limitations by identifying passively sensed markers for empirically based, transdiagnostic domains. Our sample included 557 participants selected for mental health treatment status who completed a 14-day ambulatory assessment protocol.  Data from participant’s GPS, accelerometer, motion, call logs, screen on/off, and battery status were used to derive 27 behavioral markers. Results showed that each psychopathology domain had significant, bivariate associations with 4-10 smartphone sensor variables. After adjusting for shared variance between psychopathology dimensions, all domains except thought disorder retained significant, incremental associations with sensor variables, reflecting unique behavioral signatures (standardized bs=|.15|–|.25|). The p-factor was associated with lower mobility, more time at home, later bedtime, and less phone charge (bs=|.12|–|.24|). Our findings show that domains encompassing most major forms of psychopathology are not only detectable with smartphone sensors, but there are also markers that distinguish these domains. Results showing many behavioral markers reflect non-specific psychopathology reinforces the need for dimensional, transdiagnostic models in digital psychiatry. Findings from this study can advance research on day-to-day maintenance mechanisms of psychopathology and inform development of symptom monitoring tools.",Psychology
908,,"Since Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Poland has become a frontline state due to its shared borders with Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia. From the onset of the war, both the Polish state and society have provided military and humanitarian aid to their embattled neighbour. According to the estimates, Poland’s humanitarian and military assistance to Ukraine amounts to nearly 5% of its GDP. Among countries offering aid, Poland has supplied Ukraine with the largest amount of heavy weaponry and has accepted the highest number of war refugees. Moreover, since June 2021, Poland has faced an influx of immigrants from Asia and Africa facilitated by Russia and Belarus. This hybrid warfare aims to destabilize and weaken the state. In light of these challenges, survey research was conducted on a representative sample of 728 respondents using the CAWI method (Computer-Assisted Web Interview). The findings reveal that Polish society is under stress. The conventional war in Ukraine, combined with the hybrid warfare waged by Belarus and Russia against Poland, has impacted the psychosocial well-being of Poles. There is growing fear that the war might spread into Poland along with concerns about the further influx of war refugees from Ukraine and immigrants from Asia and Africa. The economic consequences of the war have most significantly affected individuals with low status, lacking both financial and social capital. Although the impact of the war on quality of life has been limited, the respondents reported a perceived decline compared to the pre-war period. While some improvement is expected after the war, they anticipate it will not return completely to pre-war levels. The research also shows that Polish society is experiencing stress, with anxiety and depression being more prevalent among the respondents with fewer resources. People attempt to handle negative emotions by employing active strategies for coping with stress. A decline in sympathy towards Ukrainian war refugees is evident in the frontline society. Poles express negative opinions about the impact of these refugees on the country. The majority of respondents have negative attitudes towards further acceptance of Ukrainian refugees and also oppose accepting immigrants from Asia and Africa. The results of the research also indicate significant social disorganization and anomie, reflected in the lack of willingness to defend their own country in the event of a foreign invasion.",Psychology

The current study examined the effect of early home-based Parents as Teachers (PAT) intervention, family resources, and home environment on B-SR in kindergarten children from at-risk families in urban high-income European context. The data stem from 248 children from the longitudinal project ZEPPELIN that implemented an RCT design to foster educational opportunities in families with multiple psychosocial risks (73% migrants). Early childhood family resources (economic, cultural, social) and home environment (cognitive stimulation, warmth/responsiveness, physical environment/routines) were assessed in interviews and observations through the Home Observation for Measurement of the Early Childhood Environment (HOME-EC). B-SR was measured with the Head-Toes-Knees-Shoulders (HTKS) task in the first year of kindergarten (age five). PAT showed an indirect effect on HTKS in kindergarten via cognitive stimulation, while income and maternal education also predicted HTKS. Warmth/responsiveness was neither influenced by PAT nor linked to B-SR. Physical environment/routines trended negatively with HTKS performance. We discuss the implications of the findings for early interventions through developmentally sensitive pathways and highlight meaningful interrelations between broad family resources, home environmental factors, and long-term B-SR outcomes in at-risk families.",Psychology
910,,"Exposure to adversity may impair executive functioning (i.e., deficit frameworks), but could also enhance, or leave intact, specific EF abilities (i.e., adaptation frameworks). Both frameworks often use raw performance (e.g., speed) to estimate EF ability. However, this approach (1) conflates different cognitive processes, and (2) generally does not distinguish specific EF abilities from processes that are shared across EF tasks, such as general processing speed. Here, we integrate deficit and adaptation frameworks by building bridges with mathematical and cognitive psychology. Specifically, we use cognitive modeling (Drift Diffusion Modeling) to isolate different cognitive processes: speed of information accumulation, response caution, and speed of stimulus encoding and response execution. We then use structural equation modeling to investigate whether associations between adversity and cognitive processes are task-general or ability-specific. We recruited 1061 participants from the Dutch LISS panel. Participants completed a basic processing speed task, two inhibition tasks, and three attention-shifting tasks. We measured exposure to threat and material deprivation in childhood and adulthood. Exposure to threat (but not material deprivation) in adulthood was negatively associated with task-general processing speed. After accounting for task-general processes, remaining variance was not related to either inhibition or attention-shifting ability. Non-preregistered analyses showed that childhood exposure to material deprivation and threat were negatively associated with (1) general processing speed, and (2) task-specific information accumulation. The latter reflected unique features of individual tasks, rather than specific EF abilities. Taken together, these results suggest that adversity researchers overestimate associations between adversity and specific EF abilities when analyzing raw performance.",Psychology
911,,"Depression and PTSD are prevalent psychiatric conditions that often co-occur and significantly impact quality of life. Ketamine has emerged as a promising rapid-acting treatment for both conditions, while traditional treatments like psychotherapy typically require weeks to show effects. This study investigated whether combining ketamine with psychotherapy produces greater symptom improvement compared to ketamine alone. We analyzed data from 202 help-seeking individuals (60% female, mean age 41.3 years) who received either ketamine alone (KET) or ketamine plus psychotherapy (KET+PSY) across six treatment sessions within a 30-day period. Depression symptoms were measured using the PHQ-9, and PTSD symptoms were assessed using the PCL-5. Trajectories of symptom change were analyzed using generalized additive mixed-effects models, controlling for baseline symptoms, demographics, and treatment intervals. Both treatment groups showed substantial improvement in depression and PTSD symptoms, with similar patterns of rapid initial decline followed by stabilization around 11-15 days. Contrary to our hypothesis, we found no significant differences in symptom trajectories between the KET and KET+PSY groups. Exploratory analyses revealed non-significant but notable patterns where younger females showed better outcomes with combined treatment, while older males showed better outcomes with ketamine alone. These findings suggest that ketamine's therapeutic effects may be robust enough that additional psychotherapy during the acute treatment phase does not significantly enhance 30-day outcomes. However, longer-term benefits of combined treatment and potential demographic-specific treatment responses warrant further investigation. These results have important implications for treatment planning and resource allocation in clinical settings.",Psychology

We used triangulation and fitted complementary models to the simulated data and found contradicting decreasing, increasing, and null effects of initial dispositional mindfulness on subsequent change in looming. These divergent findings suggest that it is premature to assume a protective effect of dispositional mindfulness on looming and the conclusions by Prieto-Fidalgo and Calvete in this regard can be challenged. It is important for researchers to be aware that correlations, including adjusted cross-lagged effects, do not prove causality in order not to overinterpret findings, something that appears to have happened to Prieto-Fidalgo and Calvete. We recommend researchers to triangulate by fitting complementary models to their data in order to evaluate if observed effects may be due to true causal effects or if they appear to be spurious.",Psychology
913,,"Disgust helps humans avoid potentially pathogenic substances such as bodily effluvia. This reduces illness risks, and is difficult to overcome with cognitive strategies or even through simple habituation in the short term (minutes to hours). Whether habituation emerges in the long-term (months to years) is an unsolved question. Regular professional exposure to disgust elicitors is associated with lower disgust sensitivity and avoidance, but this could be due to selection and survivorship bias. Here, we avoid these limitations by testing a sample of parents (N=99) and controls (N=50) on self-report and behavioural avoidance measures. We used parent-specific items in disgust-sensitivity questionnaires, and child-related stimuli (soiled diapers) in a preferential-looking task. While the control group showed the expected behavioural avoidance, parents of children who were past the weaning stage showed almost no avoidance of stimuli depicting child-related or general bodily effluvia. Curiously, parents whose children had not been fully weaned showed similar disgust avoidance to the control group, even if they had older children who were weaned. These results suggest that parents habituate to disgust induced by faeces in diapers, and that this had generalised to other bodily effluvia. Contrary to our expectations, parents did show disgust avoidance while their (youngest) children were fed only milk, which could point to an adaptive response to reduce the risk of illness in young infants. In sum, continuous exposure to their children’s bodily effluvia inoculates parents to disgust for bodily effluvia, but only after the sensitive milk-feeding stage.",Psychology

We therefore approach the selection of entertainment media under daily adversity from a coping perspective, and the lasting effects of hedonic and eudaimonic entertainment use on hope, optimism, and gratitude from a resilience perspective. Results from a diary study with n = 6412 observations from n = 600 participants reveal a complex relationship between stressors and entertainment choices.

Our findings highlight that entertainment use serves both as a resource for resilience and as a problem-focused coping strategy.",Psychology

We used triangulation and fitted complementary models to the simulated data and found contradicting increasing, decreasing, and null effects of initial family recognition of work on subsequent change in meaningful work experience. These divergent findings suggest that it is premature to assume a facilitating effect of family recognition of work on meaningful work experience and the conclusions by Hwang et al. in this regard can be challenged. It is important for researchers to be aware that correlations, including adjusted cross-lagged effects, do not prove causality in order not to overinterpret findings, something that appears to have happened to Hwang et al. We recommend researchers to triangulate by fitting complementary models to their data in order to evaluate if observed effects may be due to true causal effects or if they appear to be spurious.",Psychology
916,,"Media are frequently used for coping with everyday stressors, but little is known
about what content individuals choose under such adversity. Building on mood management
theory’s propositions about semantic affinity of content, we test how adversity in specific life
domains is reflected in choice of entertaining media content surrounding the same life
domain. In combining diary data from n = 122 Netflix users and data donations of their
viewing histories with n = 2,122 titles, our study provides a novel methodological approach.
Our findings show no effects of daily adversity on selecting content with more or less
semantic affinity, but exploratory analyses reveal that situational media coping strategies
differentially relate to the selection of different entertainment genres. These results emphasize
(a) a lack of conceptual clarity surrounding semantic affinity in real-life media use, and (b)
the importance of situational approaches in media coping research.",Psychology
917,,"Random generation is a complex task, and is affected by several aspects of
response configuration. For example, among adult subjects, the number of response
alternatives affects response sequences; a larger set size leads to response alternatives
being sampled with uneven probabilities. This effect has been attributed to the
requirement to maintain an internal representation of all response choices
simultaneously, based on the finding that the visual provision of response alternatives
removes the set size effect in random number generation (Towse, 1998). It is of
interest, then, to establish whether children are also affected by changes in the number
of response alternatives.",Psychology

919,,"In a series of 4 experiments, Towse (1998) described the performance of adult participants in
their attempts at producing random sequences under various conditions. When the task was
to produce random numbers orally (Experiment 1), there was a consistent effect of response
speed and set size on different indices of performance. When the task was to produce key-
presses (Experiment 2), task effects were weaker, and indeed there was no significant effect of
speed or set size for R and RNG measures. The implied difference between response
modality was confirmed in Experiment 3, where number and key-press resonses were
compared directly at two set size configurations. Nonetheless, there is an issue of
replicability (especially for a null effect), and to an extent of generalisability (do all key-press
tasks behave in this way?). The following experiment examines this issue; participants were
asked to produce random key-press sequences using a single row of responses, where this

920,,"Many barriers could impede mental health behaviors including practicing self-care, seeking professional help, and engaging in interventions. Nudges, as characterized by decisional context designs such as information presentation and structure, are increasingly utilized to address these barriers and steer various health behaviors. In the realm of mental health, given a surge in nudging studies aimed at encouraging mental health behaviors has yielded some promising but inconsistent results, a systematic review is warranted to summarize these findings and understand the current state of knowledge. We reviewed the literature on mental health nudging, with inclusion of 25 studies predominantly employing between-subject framing experiments, involving mainly adult participants from Western regions, and focusing primarily on help-seeking and self-care. Findings on norm nudging and framing (self-other and positive-negative) have been mixed with some evidence of positive-framing advantage in encouraging help-seeking. Limited studies on default nudge, decoy nudge, and reminder nudge found mostly beneficial effects. We provided suggestions to advance mental health nudging research, including a call for more theory-driven research with potential mediating and moderating measures, sampling of diverse populations in mental health conditions, age, cultural backgrounds. More research on tailored nudges and comparison between different nudges are also encouraged. Finally, studies with more consequential outcome variables (e.g. mental health, behaviors over longer term), and monitoring and addressing risks of adverse effects, will be worthwhile.",Psychology
921,,"Multisensory integration (MSI) allows the brain to combine information from different sensory modalities to form a coherent perception of the environment. Externalizing disorders with impulsivity as a key symptom such as Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) have been associated with altered sensory processing and decision-making. This study investigated the relationship between impulsivity and impulsivity related behaviours, and multisensory integration. Participants had to discriminate between two visual gratings, and/or two sounds presented to the right and left ear based on respectively contrast and loudness in a two-alternative forced-choice task. The study included 44 participants, 13 of whom were diagnosed with ADHD or Disruptive Behaviour Disorders. Results show similar task performance across participants. Performance accuracies were highest on audiovisual trials and participants responded fastest on auditory trials, independent of impulsivity levels. Examining the timescale of evidence weighting revealed that early sensory information contributed most to decisions, with dynamic dominance switching between visual and auditory modalities. We found no evidence that the temporal dynamics were affected by impulsivity. These findings suggest that impulsivity and impulsivity related behaviours do not significantly affect MSI during our task and that sensory processing mechanisms remain robust against individual impulsivity levels.",Psychology
922,,"Bipolar disorder (BD) is characterised by episodes of mania and hypomania (the less severe presentation of mania). (Hypo)manic symptoms include elevated/irritable mood, increased energy, and goal-directed behaviour. Subclinical hypomania is common in non-clinical community populations, particularly among adolescents. Evidence indicates that experiencing these symptoms in youth is linked to the development of BD. However, questions remain around whether subclinical hypomania lies on the same continuum as BD phenotypically and aetiologically and, thus, represents a valid target for its study. This critical review synthesises some of the research surrounding the predictive and construct validity of youth subclinical hypomania as a quantitative trait of BD. The findings presented show that youth subclinical hypomania I) is associated with the later development of BD, and II) shares similarities with BD, including risk factors (high heritability, childhood maltreatment/adversity, substance use), and co-occurring symptoms (depression, psychosis, sleep problems, personality traits) and conditions (substance use, anxiety, personality disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism). Despite the sparsity of research and limitations of the literature, these associations are similar to those observed in other well-documented continuums (e.g., autistic traits–autism, psychotic-like experiences–adult psychopathology) and are suggestive of the predictive and construct validity of the youth subclinical hypomania–BD continuum. BD is a multisymptomatic illness that may be best understood as the intersection of various quantitative traits, but youth subclinical hypomania appears to represent one important target for its study. Given its adverse impact and association with other mental illnesses, youth subclinical hypomania warrants investigation in its own right.",Psychology
923,,"This paper introduces a scientific framework for experimentally studying the psychological states of physical systems. The framework is an updated version of the psychophysical model of mind–matter relations that flourished in Europe in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, as endorsed by figures like Gustav Fechner, Ernst Mach and Albert Einstein. This updated framework proposes a set of ‘psychological properties’ of matter that parallel established physical properties such as energy, force and mass. Presented alongside these newly defined properties are a set of provisional principles and laws that may govern the behaviour of material systems from their internal or intrinsic perspective. These may parallel the familiar laws and principles governing the behaviour of systems from an external or extrinsic perspective. The framework provided here aims to promote a unified model of mind and matter of the kind envisaged by the original proponents of psychophysics in which energy and experience are parallel aspects of all natural processes.",Psychology

In recent decades, the relationship between music and emotion has become the focus of psychological research. This chapter introduces psychological perspectives on this topic. We discuss how and why people might respond to music emotionally, and the implications for cross-cultural universality, as well as individual differences. We end by outlining three promising avenues for future research: (1) investigating individual differences in emotional responses to music, (2) leveraging citizen science to improve estimates of cross-cultural similarities, and (3) broadening our understanding of the diverse contexts in which emotional responses to music occur, through naturalistic data collection methods. The growing literature and new advances offer valuable insights into the individual, cultural, and contextual nuances that shape how music moves us.",Psychology
925,,"Meta-analytic confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) is a type of meta-analytic structural equation modeling (MASEM) that is useful for evaluating the factor structure of measurement scales based on data from multiple studies. Modeling the factor structure is just one example of many potentially interesting research questions. Analyzing covariance matrices allows for the evaluation of measurement properties across studies, such as whether indicators are functioning the same across studies. For example, are some indicators more indicative of the common factor in certain types of studies than in others? The additional analysis of means of the observed variables opens up many other research questions to consider such as: ‘Are there mean differences in mental health between clinical and non-clinical samples?’. To answer such questions, it is necessary to analyze both the covariance and the mean structure of the indicators. Meta-analytic CFA with means is applicable when the studies included in the meta-analysis used the same indicators, measured on the same scales. In this paper, we present and illustrate a method to incorporate the means of variables in MASEM analyses of such datasets. We focus on meta-analytic CFA, with the aim of testing differences in latent means across studies. We provide illustrations of the comparison of latent means across groups of studies using two empirical datasets, for which data and analysis scripts are provided online. Finally, we discuss how the proposed method relates to other analysis options such as multigroup or multilevel structural equation modeling.",Psychology
926,,"When people are offered the opportunity to choose, they tend to learn better. To investigate cognitive mechanisms of this beneficial effect of choice on learning, a learning task was designed in which we independently manipulated choice and predictability. In half of the blocks, participants could choose which object they wanted to see, while in other blocks, choices were made for them. Meanwhile, in half of the blocks, they would always see the selected object (high predictability), while in other blocks, they had 50% chance to see the selected object (low predictability). Memory accuracy was tested by a recognition task. We found a facilitatory effect of choice on learning under both high and low predictability. However, this effect was markedly smaller under low predictability. These findings suggest choices enhance learning because they are rewarding by themselves, while facilitating prediction processes. This study has important educational implications, urging teachers to offer choices to students and to satisfy students’ needs in classroom settings.",Psychology
927,,"Objective: Psychological treatment effects and response rates have largely plateaued over the past few decades. A potential answer to this problem is personalized treatment approaches, which match treatment to a client’s specific presenting concerns, which should increase its precision and efficacy. Examining predictors and moderators of treatment outcome (who is likely to benefit from treatment, and which treatment) is one way to guide such personalized decision making. The current study aimed to investigate the relationship between network-derived subgroups, treatment condition, and treatment response using data from two clinical trials on eating disorders (N = 80). This study is also a proof-of-concept for the clinical utility of network-based subgroups. Method: Subgroups were identified using Subgrouping Group Iterative Multiple Model Estimation (S-GIMME) and ANOVAs were used to compare changes in symptom severity and clinical impairment among subgroups. Results: We found three subgroups (n = 71; mean age = 34.4 [SD = 11.8], 87.3% cisgender women, 85.9% white, non-Hispanic), which were differentiated by how shame and guilt were related in the network. The subgroup with a contemporaneous pathway from guilt to shame showed the least improvement in clinical impairment from pre- to posttreatment (F(2, 64) = 5.92, p = .004). Conclusions: Overall, our findings suggest that network-based subgroups may have utility as prognostic indicators, at least in the context of eating disorders, though replication of present findings is warranted. Limitations included potentially unstable subgroups and use of mostly cisgender women and white samples.",Psychology
928,,"Measurement invariance is investigated to ensure that a measurement scale functions similarly across different demographic groups or timepoints. A prevailing approach is to fit a series of multiple-group confirmatory factor models and then compare differences in fit indices of constrained and unconstrained models. Common recommendations are that ΔCFI above −.01 or ΔRMSEA less than .01 suggests evidence of invariance. In this paper, we review the methodological literature that highlights that these widely used cutoffs do not generalize well. Specifically, distributions of fit index differences expand or contract based on model and data characteristics, making any single cutoff unlikely to maintain desirable performance across a wide range of conditions. To address this, we propose a method called dynamic measurement invariance (DMI) cutoffs, which is an extension of dynamic fit index (DFI) cutoffs originally devised to accommodate related issues in single-group models. DMI generalizes and executes a simulation based on the researcher’s specific model and data characteristics to derive custom fit index difference cutoffs with optimal performance for the model being evaluated. The paper explains the method and provides simulations and empirical examples to demonstrate its potential contribution, as well as ways in which it could be extended to expand its scope and utility. Open-source software is also provided to improve accessibility of the method.",Psychology
929,,"Perceptual distortions are widely observed in various psychiatric diseases, including Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Recent Bayesian models of psychiatric disorders and learning disabilities propose a general theory grounded on the concept of ""aberrant precision."" However, these models have yet to be used as phenomenological models for visual distortions because previous models usually only deal with a low-dimensional input with Laplace approximation. Such assumptions are necessary for precision to be well defined; otherwise, the explanation based on aberrant precision was hardly applicable. This study addresses these limitations using the predictive coding-based deep neural network PredNet and a new analysis method inspired by the precision account using the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC). We found that the visual distortion happened when trained with more extended temporal contexts, which was mitigated when we increased the weight of the prediction error of the top layer. From HSIC analysis, we showed that this weight increase enhanced the top-down information flow in prediction, which led to an enhanced ability to capture global features of the visual input, such as rotation and average brightness and hue.",Psychology

932,,"Prior research has provided initial support for the claim that cognitive control mediates the relationship between anxiety and mindfulness; however, findings are often inconsistent. In this review, we argue that the inconsistency may be due to a lack of both conceptual and methodological precision in terms of how anxiety, cognitive control, and mindfulness are operationalized and assessed, and that this imprecision may be a critical source of study confounds and ambiguous outcomes. We unpack this argument by first decomposing anxiety, cognitive control, mindfulness, and relevant experimental paradigms into key dimensions in order to develop a non-unitary, multi-dimensional taxonomy of these constructs. Subsequently, we review and reinterpret the prior experimental literature, focusing on studies that examine the relationship between anxiety and cognitive control, mindfulness and cognitive control, and the three-way relationship between anxiety, mindfulness, and cognitive control. Across the reviewed studies, there was great variation in the dimensions being examined and the behavioral and/or neural measures employed; therefore, results were often mixed. Based on this review of literature, we propose a conceptually and methodologically precise framework from which to study the effects of mindfulness on cognitive control in anxiety. The framework theoretically aligns anxiety dimensions with specific mindfulness states and interventions, further suggesting how these will impact specific cognitive control dimensions (proactive, reactive). These can be assessed with experimental paradigms and associated behavioral and neural metrics to index the relevant dimensions with high precision. Novel experimental studies and tractable research designs are also proposed to rigorously test this theoretical framework.",Psychology
933,,"In human vision, objects and scenes are fundamentally interconnected elements that play a critical role in shaping our perception and understanding of the visual world. In natural viewing conditions, objects and scenes are seldom encountered in isolation. The visual system has evolved to process the statistical probability of different spatial arrangements, with contextual information offering key insights into object functionality and relevance. One way to elucidate the human visual perceptive process is to track and predict how humans visually explore images through eye movements. Other datasets of eye movements have been shared openly online. However, existing datasets are limited by the range of camera perspectives represented (close-up viewpoints of objects or faces vs. wide-angle perspectives of real-world scenes), and the number of objects segmented within the images. To address this, we developed the Objects in Focus dataset. We semantically segmented 2800 unique objects across the 100 real-world scenes and collected measures of each object's size, eccentricity, semantic significance, and visual saliency, with an average of 28.7 segmented objects in each scene image. We also include analyses comparing the distributions of objects and fixations across scene images and discuss how image size and perspective influence attention dispersion. Finally, we relate our findings considering attention prediction networks and discuss how formal definitions of spatial arrangement probabilities can be used to improve different computer vision models.",Psychology
934,,"People derive much purpose from their work, yet time spent on work is decreasing. Here, we ask if effortful leisure is a powerful source of meaning and purpose which could supplement the reduction in labor time. In four studies (N = 2,169), we investigated the relationship between effort and meaning in leisure activities. In Study 1, we found that participants rated effortful activities as more meaningful, although less enjoyable, suggesting a trade-off between eudaimonic and hedonic wellbeing. Studies 2a and 2b provided causal evidence by comparing effortful (Sudoku puzzling) and non-effortful leisure (watching videos). Effortful activities consistently felt more meaningful, though the effects plateaued at higher levels of effort. Finally, Study 3 used experience sampling to assess activities as they occurred in real life. Effortful leisure uniquely fosters meaning while maintaining enjoyment, whereas other activities tend to feel less enjoyable with increased effort. Across all studies, we found that effort promotes daily meaningful experiences, particularly in leisure contexts, where effort does not diminish enjoyment. Effortful leisure may offer a powerful opportunity to supplement or replace the once plentiful purpose we derived from our now diminishing time at work.",Psychology
935,,"Empathic concern promotes prosocial behavior, but the effect of empathy is not the same for everyone. Scholars have extensively mapped the situational and personality factors that modulate the empathy-helping relationship, but only a few studies have examined the cognitive processes that link empathy with helping. Lockwood et al. (2016) found that individual differences in online simulation (the deliberate intention to imagine what another person is feeling) were associated with individual differences in the rates at which people learned how to benefit an anonymous other person in a two-armed bandit task (which we term prosocial learning). Across three experiments (N = 1,188), we critically tested and extended this finding by asking participants to learn on behalf of real people in need. Causal manipulations of empathy and social evaluation had no effect upon prosocial learning, and we could not replicate the finding that online simulation was associated with learning. Although each individual experiment provided only mixed evidence for the hypothesis that empathic concern is associated with prosocial learning, a mega-analysis that included data from all three experiments revealed that both state and trait empathic concern were weakly (but significantly) positively associated with prosocial learning. We discuss our results in light of problems with the methods that researchers commonly use to test the association between performance on prosocial learning tasks and individual differences in empathy.",Psychology
936,,"Interoception may contribute to social cognition by grounding the self in the body, thus facilitating selection between self and other perspectives.  While individual differences in interoceptive sensitivity are known to relate to spatial perspective-taking, similar associations have yet to be found for mentalising.  Here, for the first time, we assessed how interoceptive sensitivity relates to spontaneous level 1 visual perspective-taking – the relatively automatic tracking of what others can see.  Sixty adult participants completed the widely used heartbeat counting task followed by the dot perspective task in which they made judgements both from their own perspective and that of a human avatar.  Interoceptive sensitivity was found to relate to performance in the dot perspective task measured by accuracy, but not speed of responding.  Specifically, individuals with low interoceptive sensitivity made more errors resolving conflict between their own and others’ mental states than their counterparts with high interoceptive sensitivity.  This difference remained when time estimation and knowledge of normal heart rate were both statistically controlled.  These findings provide the first evidence that interoception modulates mentalising.  Protection from self-other blurring afforded by interoception may help reduce involuntarily intrusions from others’ mental states.",Psychology
937,,"There is an ongoing debate about the role of top-down influences on episodic binding and retrieval processes. The Binding and Retrieval in Action Control (BRAC) framework postulates that both, binding and retrieval, are modulated by top-down processes, such as awareness and instructions (Frings et al., 2020). To test this assumption, we conducted a mega-analysis in which we reanalyzed data from four contingency learning experiments (total N = 859). Contingency awareness was assessed in all experiments. Furthermore, in two experiments, contingency awareness was experimentally manipulated by instructing participants about the existing contingencies. Results show that both, binding and retrieval, are impervious to the awareness of stimulus-response contingencies (measured and manipulated). In sum, our findings suggest that stimulus-response binding and retrieval is an automatic cognitive process that operates unconsciously and independently of top-down influences such as contingency knowledge and awareness.",Psychology
938,,"Background: One in two people with a severe mental illness also has a substance use disorder. This frequent combination highlights the complexity of care required for these individuals, as conditions often interact and exacerbate each other. The accumulation of chronic conditions (either psychiatric or somatic) is defined as multimorbidity (two or more conditions). Multimorbidity is known to increase hospitalization length of stay but there is poor information about the impact of substance use disorder in the population of severe mental illness. Objectives: The goal of the present study was to determine the prevalence of multimorbidity in people with severe mental illness and substance use disorder, and also to determine whether it has an influence on hospitalization length of stay. Results: The prevalence of multimorbidity among individuals with severe mental illness and substance use disorder was 82%, and the presence of substance use disorder was associated with a shorter hospitalization length of stay. Sensitivity analyses showed that individuals with severe mental illness and a diagnosis of substance use disorder stayed 8.58 days less in hospitalization compared to those with only a severe mental illness. Conclusions: In specialized psychiatric services, the prevalence of multimorbidity is elevated in individuals with severe mental illness, and that it was comparable among those with a concomitant substance use disorder, yet this does not appear to impact the hospitalization length of stay. The additional presence of substance use disorder did seem to reduce the length of stay and that shows that substance use disorder has an impact on hospitalization length of stay, as well as increasing the presence of chronic physical and mental conditions in the same way as other severe mental illness.",Psychology
939,,"Time-to-event data such as response times and saccade latencies form a cornerstone of experimental psychology, and have had a widespread impact on our understanding of human cognition. However, the orthodox method for analyzing such data - comparing means between conditions - is known to conceal valuable information about the timeline of psychological effects, such as their onset time and duration. The ability to reveal finer-grained, ""temporal states"" of cognitive processes can have important consequences for theory development by qualitatively changing the key inferences that are drawn from psychological data. Luckily, well-established analytical approaches, such as event history analysis (EHA), are able to evaluate the detailed shape of time-to-event distributions, and thus characterize the time course of psychological states. One barrier to wider use of EHA, however, is that the analytical workflow is typically more time-consuming and complex than orthodox approaches. To help achieve broader uptake of EHA, in this paper we outline a set of tutorials that detail one distributional method known as discrete-time EHA. We touch upon several key aspects of the workflow, such as how to process raw data and specify regression models, and we also consider the implications for experimental design, as well as how to manage inter-individual differences. We finish the article by considering the benefits of the approach for understanding psychological states, as well as the limitations and future directions of this work.

940,,"Background:

A ketogenic diet, an established treatment for refractory epilepsy, is now being investigated as a potential treatment for bipolar disorder, a condition in which anti-seizure medications are commonly utilized in treatment. This study aims to better understand the lived experience of bipolar disorder patients adhering to a ketogenic diet to identify potential benefits and risks.

Methods:

A structured online questionnaire was distributed to individuals diagnosed with bipolar disorder who have adhered to a ketogenic diet. The questionnaire collected data on demographics, diet adherence, symptoms and episodes, cognitive function, physical health, and quality of life. Quantitative and qualitative methods were used to analyze the data.

Results:

A total of 103 participants completed the questionnaire. 67.8% of participants maintained an average ketone level of 1-3 mmol/L. 20.3% maintained an average level above 3 mmol/L and 11.9% maintained an average level below 1 mmol/L. 47% followed a classic ketogenic diet and 28% followed a modified ketogenic diet.

The mean number of reported episodes of mania per year decreased by 81% (3.08 to 0.58) when adhering to a ketogenic diet. And the mean number of reported episodes of depression per year decreased 79% (8.24 to 1.7) when adhering to a ketogenic diet.

Respondents reported that symptoms of depression (moderate to very severe) decreased by 66.9 percentage points (from 85.5% to 18.6%) after beginning a ketogenic diet. Those reporting no symptoms of depression increased by 40 percentage points (from 5.8% to 46.1%). Hypomania (moderate to very severe) decreased by 42.1 percentage points (from 55.7% to 13.6%). Those reporting no hypomania increased by 35.3 percentage points (from 15.2% to 50.5%). Mania (moderate to very severe): decreased by 20.3 percentage points (from 30.3% to 10%). Those reporting no symptoms of mania increased by 34.7 percentage points (from 47.5% to 82.2%). 

Thematic analysis of the qualitative data revealed that many participants reported improvements in their quality of life, cognitive function and memory, physical health (including weight loss, and reductions in blood pressure) and social and occupational functioning.  Some respondents reported side effects in the transition period into ketosis such as gastro-intestinal issues and fatigue, these were mostly mild and improved when established in ketosis, but were severe in a minority of respondents.

Conclusions:

Individuals living with bipolar disorder and adhering to a ketogenic diet report substantial benefits to their mental and physical health. These include reductions in occurrence and severity of episodes of depression, mania and hypomania, improved cognitive function, improved energy and weight loss. Most respondents adhered to forms of the diet and ketone ranges consistent with existing epilepsy guidelines. Side effects were reported in the adaptation period to ketosis, but these improved in most cases when in established ketosis. 

These findings from the lived experience of bipolar patients suggest that a ketogenic diet should be further investigated as a potential treatment for bipolar disorder. Randomized controlled trials are needed to study these effects and explore which patients may benefit from this intervention.",Psychology
941,,"Sex-specific division of labour and sophisticated tool use are important features of human societies. Play may serve as a developmental mechanism to practise gender-specific object-related skills. Object play in immatures is believed to foster object-related competencies, potentially laying the foundation for tool use later in life. Here, we investigated sex differences in the ontogeny of object play in Tsimane children in Bolivia to understand its potential role in shaping gender-specific adult roles. We used observational data (&gt;80,000 scan samples) from nine Tsimane communities collected between 2002 and 2007. We employed Bayesian multilevel models to analyse age and sex differences in object play and object types. Our results show that both overall play and object play peaked in early to middle childhood (3.5-7.5 years old), with boys spending more time playing. Moreover, boys engaged more with objects related to male-specific roles (e.g., hunting tools), while girls played more with objects related to female-specific roles (e.g., cooking utensils). Our findings suggest that object play serves as an adaptive, culturally embedded pathway to develop gender-specific adult skills. Studying developmental patterns of object play across human cultures enriches our understanding of the evolutionary contexts shaping divisions of labour.",Psychology

943,,"Background: Bidirectional and transactional models of parent-child mental health symptom exchange suggest that parents and offspring have the potential to influence functioning in each other. Many studies have explored bidirectional associations; however, none have studied transactional associations involving parent internalising, offspring internalising and offspring externalising symptoms. The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with marked changes in parent and offspring mental health, providing an enhanced opportunity to examine bidirectional and transactional relationships over time. 

Methods: We examined survey data from the UK-based longitudinal COVID-19: Supporting Parents, Adolescents and Children during Epidemics (Co-SPACE) study over four time points during the first year of the pandemic. Data from 2,548 parents/carers of 4-16-year-old children, collected between May 2020 and May 2021, were analysed using cross-lagged panel modelling. 

Results: There were significant differences in bidirectional associations between parent internalising symptoms, offspring internalising and offspring externalising symptoms according to offspring age. We found transactional relations between parent internalising and offspring internalising symptoms, but this finding was driven by older offspring. 

Conclusions: These findings suggest that parent and offspring mental health symptoms are likely to interact over time, and that the pattern of exchange may be particularly pronounced in older offspring.",Psychology
944,,"This review examines post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms and associated factors, amongst parents of autistic children. A systematic review of the literature produced seven studies (N=1717) that met the selection criteria. A random-effects model showed that 24% of the aggregated sample experienced PTSD symptoms. Child behaviours of concern and parent mental health issues were associated with PTSD symptoms in the parents. The findings indicate that a significant number of parents of autistic children experience symptoms consistent with PTSD. The authors acknowledge significant heterogeneity across the reviewed studies. Two of the seven studies combined autistic children with those who have other developmental conditions, and only three directly examined PTSD symptoms related to parenting an autistic child. This study is important as it highlights significant gaps in existing research, emphasizing the need for focused studies on the unique challenges faced by these parents.  

Note for readers: The authors have chosen to use identity-first language when referring to individuals with an autism diagnosis (i.e., autistic child) as opposed to person-first language (i.e., child with autism). This decision was made in accordance with the recent neurodiversity affirming movement towards the de-stigmatization of autism, and research indicating that a large majority of autistic people prefer identity-first language (Botha et al., 2023; Bury et al., 2023; Izuno-Garcia et al., 2023; Taboas et al., 2023).

Quantitative data on affective state, communication attitudes, and perceptions of knowledge and skills were collected pre- and post-intervention via questionnaires. Qualitative data were obtained through open-ended questions and a focus group. Data were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA and thematic analysis. Results: Significant reductions in negative affect and increases in perceived knowledge and skills were observed post-intervention. No significant changes were found in communication attitudes. Qualitative findings supported the quantitative results, indicating enhanced confidence and reduced anxiety during simulated patient interactions. Conclusions: Utilizing AI as SPs is an effective pedagogical tool that enhances experiential learning, increases student confidence in professional skills, and positively influences the affective state. This innovative approach offers a valuable supplement to traditional teaching methods in psychology education.",Psychology
946,,"This study aims to evaluate the test-retest reliability of four computerized cognitive tests designed to measure selective attention, sustained attention, visual search, and visual scanning. Given the growing use of computerized cognitive assessments in clinical, educational, and research settings, ensuring their reliability is crucial. The sample consisted of 39 young adults who completed computerized versions of the Trail Making Test, Visual Search Test, Sustained Attention to Response Test, and Selective Attention Test developed by CogniFit Inc. (San Francisco, US) across three sessions. The study included two key comparisons – test-retest on different days and immediate test-retest on the same day – analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA, Pearson’s correlation and Intraclass correlation. Results indicated consistent outcomes across sessions for all tests, except for certain variables where immediate repetition likely induced practice or learning effects and for variables that are not crucial for the task. It also showed correlations in all the tests in at least one measure. These findings support the reliability of these tests over short intervals, aligning with previous research on traditional and computerized cognitive assessments. The study highlights the utility of these computerized tests as a reliable and accessible tool for cognitive evaluation, with potential for broad application in various settings. Future research should explore longer test-retest intervals and diverse populations to further validate these tools' reliability and applicability.",Psychology
947,,"What gay and bisexual men want and why are not value-neutral questions. Rather, prior work on intracommunity stigma, fetishization, and racial prejudice suggests gay and bisexual men’s sexual desires are inflected by forms of intimate discrimination, most notably racism and anti-fat bias. These systems of discrimination shape who gay and bisexual men see as the legitimate objects of their sexual desires – that is, who and what they find sexually desirable. Yet what constitutes sexual desirability remains unclear. We report on a reflexive thematic analysis of interviews with 24 diverse Australian gay and bisexual men’s (aged 21 to 64) constructions of sexual desirability. Gay and bisexual men construct sexual desirability as multidimensional, involving appearance, affect, and behavior. What interviewees found desirable was dynamic, changing between time, place, and social interactions. Sexual desirability was constructed as shaped by intersecting systems of power. We discuss three: sexual orientalism, sexual anti-fat bias, and sexual racism. We conclude that understanding how and why sexual desirability is inequitably distributed is necessary to redress intimate discrimination among gay and bisexual men and their sexual communities. Future work should clarify how sexual desirability relates to mental and sexual health and social equality more broadly.",Psychology
948,,"One benefit of multisensory integration is the acceleration of responses in a perceptual decision task, provided that the corresponding unisensory signals each offer sufficient information for the decision —a well-known effect termed the redundant signal effect (RSE). The current study explored the basic principles modulating the RSE by creating several distinct types of unisensory signal changes and examining how these principles are reflected in the computational mechanisms underlying the RSE. Our results showed that the congruency between unisensory change signals does not significantly modulate the RSE, as incongruent multisensory changes produced the RSE similarly to congruent multisensory changes. Instead, we identified a robust factor accounting for the RSE: two unisensory signals with closer mean reaction times (or mean evidence accumulation rates) accelerate multisensory decision-making more effectively. Further modelling results demonstrated that this general principle naturally emerges from computational models that best predict the speeded responses to multisensory change signals. This implies that numerically similar unisensory accumulation rates either enhance each other or lower the decision threshold, ultimately accelerating decision-making. Together, these findings offer a comprehensive understanding of how we integrate redundant change signals to facilitate multisensory decision-making.",Psychology
949,,"Humans perceive a vividly colored world coherently across the visual field, even though our peripheral vision has limited color sensitivity compared to central vision. How is this sense of color uniformity achieved? This question can be explored through a phenomenon called the pan-field color illusion, in which observers perceive scene images achromatized in the peripheral region (chimera images) as full-color images. Our previous work demonstrated that inattention to the peripheral visual field contributed to this illusion. Upon this observation, the current study presents signal detection theory modeling to quantify the effects of inattention on internal color signal strength and its variability. The model fitting has revealed that inattention to the peripheral region increases internal signal variability. This inattentional noise increases the occurrence of strong color signals that exceed the internal color detection criterion, thereby intensifying the pan-field color illusion. These results extend previously documented effects of inattentional noise on simple psychophysical tasks (e.g., “subjective inflation” in grating detection and discrimination), accounting for the illusorily enriched peripheral color experience for naturalistic scene images. Our findings suggest that inattentional noise inherent in peripheral vision would be a key factor in achieving the vivid visual phenomenology experienced across the entire visual field.",Psychology
950,,"The Response Time Concealed Information Test can reveal that a person recognizes a relevant item (probe, e.g. a murder weapon) among other, irrelevant items (controls), based on slower responses to the probe compared to the controls. A previous study (Lukács, 2022, JARMAC) analyzed the data of 14 experiments and demonstrated that classification accuracy is increased by increased test length (i.e., increased number of trials included in the analysis). However, that study left the important question open whether prior practice (whose trials are not included in the analysis) influences the classification accuracy of subsequent testing (i.e., subsequent trials included in the analysis). Reanalysing the same data from the 14 experiments (comprising 2,223 individual tests), we show that different sections of the test (each with the same number of trials), such as the first and second half of each examined test, do not differ substantially in their classification accuracy. The main implications for real life application are that, at least up to about 600 trials, prior practice does not affect subsequent tests’ results, and the number of examined relevant items or their order of presentation may be freely chosen without compromising the method’s validity.",Psychology
951,,"PURPOSE: Speech contains auditory cues conveyed by the voice and visual cues produced by articulators, that are commonly integrated to form salient audiovisual percepts. How individuals make use of these cues depends on listener- and stimulus-specific factors. For example, cochlear implant (CI) users rely more on visual cues and the perceptual gains associated with multisensory integration than typically-hearing controls, while both groups are more likely to integrate auditory and visual cues when they occur synchronously. Here, we examine the interaction between these effects by quantifying how asynchrony affects speech intelligibility in CI users and typically-hearing controls.

METHODS: Participants were presented with audio-only, visual-only, synchronous audiovisual, and asynchronous audiovisual sentences. Intelligibility was quantified as the proportion of keywords correctly reported. Benefits associated with multisensory integration across offsets were computed by comparing performance to unisensory conditions.

RESULTS: Intelligibility and multisensory gain were strongest near synchrony for both groups, tapering off as audiovisual asynchrony increased. CI users showed larger decrements in performance with increasing offset than controls. At the largest audio-leading offset, CI users’ performance continued to decrease while controls improved relative to smaller offsets.

CONCLUSION: Typically-hearing listeners benefit from multisensory integration over a broader range of speech offsets than CI users. Interestingly, at extreme offsets CI users appear to be impaired by visual speech cues compared to typically hearing individuals, suggesting they may attempt to use visual speech cues to inform intelligibility even when they occur outside of the range of perceptual integration. These findings align with literature on visual bias in CI users, and raise questions regarding potential compensatory mechanisms for speech intelligibility.",Psychology
952,,"Chalmers’ Constructing the World offers an exploration into complete bodies of information – for which he proposes that an entity such as Laplace’s Demon has a scrutable interpretation over available information. However, Chalmers does not address a true realisation of what a complete knowledge should be; Laplace’s Demon remains very much human. This article further suggests that information is limited – specifically in a post-modernist framework – because the limited number of perceptible differences (known as Categories) reduces the scale of differences such that the information converges into a common limitation.",Psychology
953,,"Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) is increasingly recognized as a vital tool for tracking the fluctuating nature of mental states and symptoms in psychiatric research. However, determining the optimal sampling rate — that is, deciding how often participants should report their symptoms — remains a significant challenge. To address this issue, our study utilizes the Nyquist-Shannon Theorem from signal processing, which establishes that any sampling rate more than twice the highest frequency component of a signal is adequate. In our study, we applied this insight to analyze two EMA datasets on depressive symptoms with a combined 35,452 data points: dataset 1 from the WARN-D study features daily 7-point Likert measurements of the two core depression symptoms from 368 participants over 85 days, dataset 2 includes four daily 0-100 visual analogue scale measurements of the same core depression symptoms from 39 participants over a minimum of 30 days. Our analysis of both datasets suggests that the most effective sampling strategy involves measurements at least every other week. We find that measurements at higher frequencies provide valuable and consistent information across both datasets, with significant peaks at weekly and daily intervals. Furthermore, a robustness analysis using a broader set of symptoms aligning with the DSM-5 criteria for depression in dataset 2 leads to similar results. This suggests that the ideal frequency for measurements remains largely consistent, regardless of the specific symptoms used to estimate depression severity. We discuss our results in the context of aligning the ideal frequency for EMA measurements with specific study goals and needs. For conditions where abrupt or transient symptom dynamics are expected, such as during treatment, more frequent data collection is recommended. However, for regular monitoring, weekly assessments of depressive symptoms may be sufficient. We discuss the implications of our findings for EMA study optimization, address our study's limitations, and outline directions for future research.",Psychology
954,,"Speech comprehension has been described as an effortless and robust process; yet, in real-world contexts, it is common for a listener to misunderstand what was said, or fail to derive meaning entirely. Typically, methods of measuring speech comprehension are applied `post-hoc' - that is, after the comprehension has happened. This lacks the time resolution necessary to capture comprehension as it dynamically unfolds, and introduces memory confounds. The absence of appropriate time-resolved behavioral measurements has limited the field's understanding of the neural processes involved in online comprehension. To overcome these challenges, we designed and tested a novel way of measuring real-time speech comprehension during naturalistic listening. We built a slider device that synchronizes with behavioral and neural recording software and provides millisecond read-out. Thirty participants listened to audiobook segments while providing continuous comprehension ratings using the slider. To vary comprehension success, we presented speech segments at speed factors 1-5 times faster than normal. We validated the time-resolved slider data against established speech comprehension assessment methods: (i) 10-point scale rating, (ii) multiple choice question, and (iii) written summary, and obtained working memory and auditory acuity performance to account for by-participant variability that is not related to comprehension. Overall, our findings validate our novel time-resolved comprehension measure and demonstrate that it is possible to derive an online behavioral measure of real-time speech comprehension, the lack of which has been a major limitation of naturalistic language studies. We also confirmed numerous limitations of static post-hoc assessments, including challenges of multi-choice question design, and the confounding of potential effects due to recency bias and comprehension for summarization. The measure proposed here overcomes the constraints of static post-hoc assessments and can be effectively integrated with neuroimaging techniques, offering a valuable tool for future research on dynamic processes during naturalistic listening.",Psychology
955,,"Dozens of dispositional aggressiveness questionnaires and their idiosyncratic factor structures have been distilled into six factors: Relational, Angry, Violent, Retaliatory, Intimate, and Alcohol Aggression. Do sub-populations exist that fail to replicate these six factors? Factor mixture modeling of these aggressiveness items (N = 1,447 diverse undergraduates) identified three latent profiles characterized by medium (41.12% of sample), high (13.75%), or low (45.13%) levels of all six factors. Like the ‘Big Bang’ the six factors began strongly-correlated in the low aggressiveness profile and then rapidly drifted apart in nomological space among more aggressive profiles. All original factors re-emerged in profile-specific factor analyses, excepting Violent Aggression. Thus, the six-factor model of aggressiveness appears largely robust to population heterogeneity.",Psychology
956,,"We examine evidence for the validity of different measures under the label emotional intelligence (EI). Some measures are valid for the assessment of EI and others are valid for the assessment of socioemotional attributes (SEA). The constructs of EI and SEA are defined and measures of each described, along with the mental response processes the measures elicit: test-takers’ abilities, self-estimated attributes, or observer reports. Both EI and SEA measures are valid but for distinctly different purposes, and the two classes of measures make different predictions. We add our voices to those who have advocated for dropping the EI label from SEA measures to more clearly draw the distinction between the two. Being clearer about constructs and measures will enhance consulting in the workplace and other applied settings.",Psychology
957,,"Quebec French is reportedly developing rhoticity, with low F3 resulting from a bunched or retroflexed tongue (like English /ɚ/), in some or all of its front mid rounded vowels /ø, œ, œ̃/. The source of this rare, understudied sound change is unclear from previous work: contact with English and contrast enhancement have been suggested, and phonologization of coarticulation is typologically plausible. We examine this issue, investigating the apparent time change in the F3 trajectories of the three vowels using generalized additive mixed models on a corpus of parliamentary speech (106 speakers from across Quebec). We observe rhoticity in /ø/ and /œ̃ /: men begin with low F3 in these vowels, and women show change in progress. Conversely, there is less clear evidence of change in /œ/. We suggest these findings are best explained by rhoticity being a two-phased change, originally due to borrowing and subsequently spreading through contrast enhancement. Rhotacization, we argue, is the combined product of intensive exposure to English (which led to frequent non-integration of bunched/retroflex segments in loanwords) and an exceptionally large vowel inventory. It thus results from the unique interplay of social and phonological factors in Quebec French, which is consistent with such changes being cross-linguistically rare.",Psychology
958,,"It is proposed that the term ‘psychedelics’, used for a certain class of psychoactive substances, be replaced by our new term 'psychosomadelics'. In our view, this step is necessary because the term 'psychedelics' is psychocentric (i.e. focusing primarily on the effects on the mind) and therefore neglects the somatic (bodily) effects of these substances. This is of particular importance as knowledge of the extensive effects that these substances have on the body is rapidly increasing. Furthermore, from a philosophical point of view, this new term also evolves and expands the connotations of such substances and their effects, as it indirectly relates to philosophical mind-body ontologies and phenomenologies. The term 'psychosomadelics' denotes both mind and body concepts, and also connotes their proposed relations – thereby providing balance and enrichment to the associated discourse. We thus suggest that the new term be adopted.",Psychology
959,,"Importance: There has been a recent rise in anti-transgender state policies targeting gender minority (GM) — transgender and gender diverse — people, likely impacting the mental health of sexual and gender minority (SGM) people and GM people. 

Objective: To estimate changes in mental health symptoms associated with recent enactment of anti-transgender state policies among SGM people and GM people specifically. 

Design: A staggered difference-in-differences analysis to examine the associations between anti-transgender policies and mean changes in mental health outcomes.

Setting: United States

Participants: SGM adults who completed annual questionnaires between April 1, 2020 and May 2023 for The Population Research in Identity and Disparities for Equality (PRIDE) Study, a national, prospective, continuously enrolling, online, cohort study of SGM adults.

Exposures: Living in a state with one or more of the following enacted policies: (1) restrictions on GM people using bathrooms congruent with their gender identity; (2) bans on GM young people participating in sports; (3) bans on gender-affirming care. 

Main Outcomes: Mean levels of anxiety (7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale), depression (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire), and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms (6-item PTSD Checklist).

Results: Of the 8,733 SGM participants in the sample, 4,354 (49.9%) were GM, 7,884 (78.6%) identified as White only, and the median age of participants was 32.5 years old. Among all SGM participants, anti-transgender policy enactment was associated with increases in anxiety (1.01 points, 95% CI=[0.01, 2.03]) and PTSD (0.97 points, 95% CI=[0.07, 1.87]) symptoms, but smaller and non-significant increases in depression symptoms (0.75 points, 95% CI=[-0.36, 1.85]). In the GM subsample, smaller, non-significant increases in anxiety (0.86 points, 95% CI=[-0.50, 2.22]), depression (0.29 points, 95%CI=[-1.27, 1.85]), and PTSD (0.89 points, 95% CI=[-0.49, 2.26]) were observed after policy enactment. GM adults had high mental health symptoms across the study period, which may account for the smaller increases in GM adults’ symptoms in states that enacted policies. 

Conclusions: Anti-transgender policies are likely negatively impacting SGM people’s mental health. Given the already high levels of mental health symptoms observed, multi-level interventions are necessary to support SGM people’s mental health amid this recent wave of anti-transgender policies.",Psychology
960,,"This study examines changes over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic in parenting and parental well-being as important indicators of family functioning. Based on the Family Stress Model, the current study tests the prediction that parents who experienced more stress and had less personal, couple, and social resources early in the pandemic were more likely to experience negative changes in their parenting and parental well-being at later stages. Latent class growth analysis was conducted using three waves of data during the first year of the pandemic (July 2020, October 2020, and February 2021) from a Dutch sample of 188 parents and their partners, with children living at home. Most groups showed stable parenting and parental well-being across the first year of the pandemic, but 13% to 16% of the parents showed moderate and increasing parenting problems and parent-child relationship problems. These families were characterized by higher stress levels and less personal resilience and dyadic coping, and to a smaller degree also less secure attachment and social support early in the pandemic. Early detection of families that risk increasing parenting problems may benefit family interventions and policy in the event of new disease outbreaks.",Psychology
961,,"The debate around the integration hypothesis in acculturation research often hinges on the interpretation of effect sizes. Critics label these effects as too small and inconsistent, questioning their significance, while supporters argue they are robust enough to validate the hypothesis. This controversy underscores a broader challenge and widespread misunderstanding among psychologists regarding the philosophical basis of measurement and causality, specifically the vague criteria for what constitutes a ‘sufficient’ effect size. The ambiguity may arise from the field’s limited focus (characteristic of psychology in general) on the issues of measurement, and is compounded by the common ‘ergodic fallacy,’ which mistakenly applies group level characteristics to individuals. This paper addresses these issues through three main discussions. Firstly, it evaluates the ongoing debate on the integration hypothesis in light of recent meta-analyses. Secondly, it analyzes how effect sizes should be attributed—whether to populations, samples, or individuals—and establishes criteria for assessing their significance. Lastly, it examines the philosophical underpinnings of measurement in psychology and causality. By exploring these areas, the paper aims to clarify and enhance the coherence of discussions on effect sizes, measurement, and causality in acculturation research.",Psychology
962,,"We investigate how context granularity, i.e. whether fine or coarse distinctions need to be made, influences an emerging lexicon. We conduct an agent-based simulation of a concept-level reference game, in which agents learn to communicate about concepts that are operationalized by combining multiple objects. We create three experimental conditions by manipulating the context in which the instances of the target concept appear: In the fine context condition, agents must make precise distinctions between similar targets and distractors. In the coarse context condition, targets are easy to discriminate because they share no overlapping features with the distractors. In the mixed baseline condition, both fine and coarse distinctions are necessary.
Our results suggest that agents adapt their communication strategies to the granularity of the context in which they learned the concepts. In the fine context and baseline conditions, agents develop a communication protocol heavily based on one-to-one mappings between messages and concepts. Conversely, in the coarse context condition agents communicate more efficiently by vastly relying on abstract references that may refer to more than a single concept but are unambiguous in context. These results show that ambiguity emerges in coarse contexts and that ambiguous abstract terms are used for more efficient communication.",Psychology

964,,"Experiences of uncontrollability affect the efficiency of cognitive control. However, the underlying reasons for these cognitive after-effects remain unclear. In this research, we take a motivational perspective and test the hypothesis that uncontrollability leads to avoidance of mental effort. We examined this hypothesis in two preregistered experiments, in which we induced uncontrollability by giving participants tasks with action-non-contingent feedback and subsequently measuring effort investment using two different tasks: a Demand Selection Task (DST; Experiment 1, N = 329) and a Voluntary Task Switching procedure (VTS; Experiment 2, N = 358). Overall, both experiments showed that uncontrollability led to effort avoidance, particularly depending on the perceived task load. Additionally, for Voluntary Task Switching, uncontrollability resulted in lower switch rates in the early free-choice trials of the task. These results coincide with our prediction that uncontrollability can drive cognitive effort avoidance, with effects varying based on perceived task load and the type of effort measure used.",Psychology
965,,"Honesty, defined as freedom from fraud or deception, is widely valued in many aspects of life, from personal relationships to professional settings. Yet acts of dishonesty remain widespread, including political and corporate scandals, misinformation, personal betrayal, and so on. Understanding honesty and the factors that influence it provides insights that are essential for fostering trust and combating corruption. In this review, we synthesize key findings from research on honesty, focusing on when people choose to be truthful or deceptive. We argue that although much is known about honesty in isolated, low-risk contexts, an urgent need exists to study honesty in more complex, realistic settings, such as those involving interpersonal relationships, potential sanctions, or group influences. Our proposed framework highlights understudied contexts and encourages future studies to explore settings where enforcement and social dynamics play a significant role in decision-making. To do so, we point out 66 open research questions that we find most promising to explore. By integrating insights from multiple disciplines, we aim to advance the understanding of honesty and provide a roadmap for research that can inform policies and interventions to promote integrity in society.",Psychology

967,,"Subjective experience is key to understanding affective states, characterized by valence and arousal. Traditional experiments using post-stimulus summary ratings do not resemble natural behavior. Fluctuations of affective states can be explored with dynamic stimuli, such as videos. Continuous ratings can capture moment-to-moment affective experience, however the rating or the feedback can be interfering. 
We designed, empirically evaluated, and openly share AffectTracker, a tool to collect continuous ratings of two-dimensional affective experience (valence and arousal) during dynamic stimulation, such as 360-degree videos in immersive virtual reality. AffectTracker comprises three customizable feedback options: a simplified affect grid (Grid), an abstract pulsating variant (Flubber), and no visual feedback.
Two studies with healthy adults were conducted, each at two sites (Berlin, Germany, and Torino, Italy). In Study 1 (Selection: n=51), both Grid and Flubber demonstrated high user experience and low interference in repeated 1-min 360-degree videos. Study 2 (Evaluation: n=83) confirmed these findings for Flubber with a longer (23-min), more varied immersive experience, maintaining high user experience and low interference. 
Continuous ratings collected with AffectTracker effectively captured valence and arousal variability. For shorter, less eventful stimuli, their correlation with post-stimulus summary ratings demonstrated the tool’s validity; for longer, more eventful stimuli, it showed the tool’s benefits of capturing additional variance.  
Our findings suggest that AffectTracker provides a reliable, minimally interfering method to gather moment-to-moment affective experience also in immersive environments, offering new research opportunities to link affective states and physiological dynamics.",Psychology

We aimed to examine the potential impact of religiosity and religious fundamentalism on conformity. With the growth of technology, many decisions are now made online, such as during video meetings. This shift prompted us to investigate online conformity in a pre-registered study. To measure conformity, we adapted Asch’s paradigm, using actors in an online video meeting to perform a simple perceptual task based on the classic line-length procedure. Our study focused on two constructs: (1) centrality of religiosity across its dimensions and (2) religious fundamentalism. We hypothesized that higher religiosity and higher levels of religious fundamentalism would be associated with greater online conformity. Consistent with our hypothesis, we found that religious fundamentalism positively correlated with online conformity, whereas the centrality of religiosity showed no relationship with conformity in the online setting.",Psychology
970,,"This study investigated the cognitive biases underlying baccarat gambling behaviors through an analysis of 17,970,830 games played by 6,625 customers in a casino. Baccarat, a popular high-stakes game in East Asia, involves predicting the outcome of two hands, where the results are inherently unpredictable, similar to the structure of games such as roulette. In contrast to existing theories predicting the emergence of the gambler’s fallacy—or negative recency—when the outcome generation mechanism is clearly random, most baccarat gamblers exhibit the opposite bias, demonstrating a tendency toward positive recency. Specifically, customers increasingly placed bets on future outcomes to match past consecutive outcomes as streaks grew longer. This trend-following behavior diminished when streaks were interrupted, ruling out explanations based on the “hot outcome” fallacy, which is typically associated with adaptive behaviors such as resource foraging. Moreover, betting amounts increased slightly but reliably when gamblers followed trends. These findings provide new insights into cognitive biases in gambling, challenge established theories of positive and negative recency, and underscore the importance of considering the unique structural characteristics of specific games when studying gambling behavior. This perspective may also contribute to a deeper understanding of pathological and problem gambling.",Psychology
971,,"Defense attorneys for autistic criminal defendants sometimes argue that difficulties inferring others’ intentions and motivations—often referred to as Theory of Mind (ToM)—considered to characterize autistic people render them vulnerable to exploitation. In this chapter we examine the empirical evidence for such claims. Current evidence derives primarily from studies of autistic and non-autistic adults’ responding in traditional deception detection paradigms and in several novel paradigms used to probe autistic adults’ ability to detect and respond adaptively to others’ criminal intent during interactions. This evidence does not support the perspective that autistic adults are inherently vulnerable to criminal exploitation, although it does indicate that ToM difficulties and low verbal ability are independent risk factors, regardless of autism diagnostic status. Although marked ToM difficulties are more prevalent in autistic adult samples, they are not ubiquitous, thereby highlighting the importance of basing legal defense arguments on measured rather than assumed ToM characteristics. Despite the recent emergence of paradigms for exploring criminal vulnerability, further significant empirical advances will likely depend on the development of paradigms which assess autistic adults’ ability to respond appropriately when confronted with problematic situations that capture the complexities of real-life interactions.",Psychology
972,,"Studies investigating objective measures of auditory perception when using cochlear implants (CIs) differ in the stimuli used and in the neural response measured. The present study aims to disentangle the effects of response type and of stimulus type on neural response properties. We report three measures corresponding with separate neural latencies, all collected from the same 19 CI recipients and with the same stimulus, consisting of a continuous low rate electrical pulse train of about 40 pulses per second (pps). These measures comprise the electrically evoked compound action potential (eCAP), auditory brainstem response (eABR), and auditory steady-state response (eASSR), having putative neural generators in peripheral (auditory nerve), subcortical (brainstem), and thalamo-cortical auditory regions, respectively.  When assessing correlations across CI recipients, we found that the growth of eASSR amplitude with stimulus level was correlated with that of eCAP amplitude and predictive of the just-noticeable-to-comfortable electrical dynamic range, as measured through behavioral loudness scaling. Additionally, we compared eASSRs measured with the ~40-pps stimulus and with a high-rate (500-pps) pulse train modulated in amplitude at rates around 40 Hz, and found that both showed similar recipient-specific effects of stimulation rate on response phase and amplitude. Our results highlight that neural responses to different electrical stimuli and at different central processing stages share common idiosyncratic properties, and support the validity of eASSRs for loudness growth estimation in CI recipients.",Psychology
973,,"This paper investigates the spatial dimensions of olfactory perception, challenging philosophical views that marginalize smell in spatial navigation and cognition compared to visual phenomenology. I argue that both olfactory and visual perceptions—despite smell often being considered non-spatial or minimally spatial—involve intricate spatial structuring when processed through unconscious cognitive processes. An information- theoretical approach shows that cognitive inferences turn spatially deficient sensory data into spatialized perceptual content to generate spatial perception across sensory modalities. This challenges the idea that spatial perception is tied to external features. My argument is supported by two lines of evidence: (i) figure-ground segregation across sensory modalities, suggesting a general mechanism in perceptual processing; (ii) recent neuroscientific evidence demonstrating how spatial information is processed in olfaction for navigation and environmental mapping. My analysis calls for a reevaluation of assumptions about the non-spatial nature of smell, highlighting significant cognitive and spatial capabilities in olfaction.",Psychology

This paper proposes Mixture Multigroup Bayesian SEM (MixMG-BSEM), a novel method for comparing structural relations across many groups while accounting for approximate measurement invariance in factor loadings. Traditional methods often assume exact measurement invariance, which may not reflect real-world data where small differences in measurement parameters commonly occur across many groups. MixMG-BSEM addresses this by using Multigroup Bayesian CFA with small-variance priors to allow for these small differences, and groups are then clustered based on their structural relations using Mixture Modeling. This is done in a stepwise estimation procedure built on the structural-after-measurement approach. By combining cluster-specific structural relations with small between-group differences in measurement parameters, MixMG-BSEM obtains a clustering that is driven only by the structural relations. The robustness and effectiveness of MixMG-BSEM are demonstrated through a simulation study.",Psychology

We measured EF, family SES, and mathematical abilities at T1 and mathematical abilities at T2 (20 months later). Our analysis yielded two main findings: (a) family SES was positively associated with T1 mathematical abilities across all three domains, but was not significantly associated with T2 mathematical abilities after controlling for T1 mathematical abilities; (b) family SES was indirectly associated with T1 arithmetical ability and T2 logical reasoning ability via working memory. Our study provides a nuanced insight of the specific cognitive mechanisms underlying the impact of socioeconomic disadvantage on the mathematical development of early elementary school children.",Psychology

This project reports on a series of interviews conducted Summer 2024 with researchers and digital infrastructure providers, on ‘meta.data’: current conceptions, the needs of the community, what tools are being offered currently, and the future of the field. Starting from 17 basic questions, we explore questions about e.g., how people name their variables, struggles with reusing and making data clear, potential tools, and our own proposed solutions through approximately 1 hour interviews. The interviews were held online, recorded, transcribed, and analyzed to find the major themes and e.g., data standards mentioned throughout the interviews. Our team was able to interview representatives from many of the major data standards and initiatives in the area e.g., RDA, BIDS, DDI, GESIS, &amp; Frictionless.

978,,"Cognitive control enables the flexible regulation of goal-directed behaviors in the presence of distractions. This study investigates proactive (PDF) and reactive distraction filtering (RDF), two distinct cognitive control mechanisms proposed by the Dual Mechanism of Control theory. Using a Flanker task with varying proportions of congruent and incongruent trials, we assessed behavioral responses, eye-gaze data, and high temporal-resolution EEG signals. Behavioral results replicated prior findings, demonstrating that PDF reduces interference in high-conflict contexts but incurs filtering costs when distractors are absent. Eye-gaze analysis revealed that PDF narrows attentional focus on targets, potentially explaining these costs. ERP data showed distinct neural correlates: N2 amplitudes indexed conflict monitoring in RDF, while frontal slow waves reflected sustained attentional control in PDF. This study provides novel insights into the behavioral, visual, and neural dynamics of cognitive control, emphasizing the temporal interplay between proactive and reactive strategies in distraction filtering.",Psychology

iconicity) by an independent group of participants before implementing their actual
experiment. Up to now, several research groups have made such rating data publicly
available but a central resource is currently still lacking. Against this background, this short
paper provides a roadmap for the collaborative creation of a so-called “DGS-LEX”, a lexical

980,,"The human brain has the capacity to automatically compute the grammatical relations of
words in sentences, be they spoken or written. This species-specific ability for syntax lies at
the core of our capacity for language and is primarily subserved by a left-hemispheric fronto-
temporal network consisting of the posterior inferior frontal gyrus (pIFG), as well as the
posterior middle temporal gyrus and superior temporal sulcus (pMTG/STS). To date, it
remains unclear whether this core network for syntactic processing identified for spoken and
written language in hearing people also holds for the processing of the grammatical structure
of a natural sign language in deaf people. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, a
sign language paradigm that systematically varied the presence of syntactic and lexical-
semantic information, and meta-analytically defined functional regions-of-interests derived
from a large dataset of syntactic processing in hearing non-signers, we demonstrate that deaf
native signers of German Sign Language (DGS) also recruit left pIFG and pMTG/STS for
computing grammatical relations in sign language—indicating the universality of the core
language network. These findings suggest that the human brain evolved a dedicated neural
network for processing the grammatical structure of natural languages independent of
language modality, which flexibly interacts with different externalization systems depending
on the modality of language use.",Psychology

We do not find evidence that exposure to these excerpts influenced political attitudes (such as distrust in the opposition, perceptions of outsider threat, and meta-perceptions of these attitudes in society). Additionally, there was no evidence that mentioning the source of the information affected the persuasiveness of the news articles, nor that party preferences or political interest moderates any of these effects.

Here, we simulated data to resemble the data used by Cau and Liu. We used triangulation and fitted complementary models to the simulated data and found contradicting decreasing and increasing effects of initial self-esteem on subsequent change in anxiety and academic self-efficacy. These divergent findings suggest that it is premature to assume a protective effect of self-esteem on anxiety and an enhancing effect on academic self-efficacy and the conclusions by Cau and Liu in this regard can be challenged. It is important for researchers to be aware that correlations, including adjusted cross-lagged effects, do not prove causality in order not to overinterpret findings, something that appears to have happened to Cau and Liu. We recommend researchers to triangulate by fitting complementary models to their data in order to evaluate if observed effects may be due to true causal effects or if they appear to be spurious.",Psychology
987,,"Introduction: Psychedelic research has expanded globally, but studies in Japan remain limited due to strict drug policies and social stigma. This study investigates the demographic characteristics and mental health effects of psychedelic use among Japanese users, providing insights for future drug policy and mental healthcare.

Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of Japanese psychedelic users recruited via social media (X, formerly Twitter) from May 1 to June 1, 2024. Eligible participants (aged 18+, Japanese nationals) completed an online questionnaire, reporting demographic data, psychedelic use history, and mental health assessments. Depression and anxiety were measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scales before and after psychedelic use.

Results: Among 615 participants, the average age was 33.8 years. LSD was the most used psychedelic. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests showed significant reductions in depression and anxiety scores after psychedelic use (PHQ-9: Z = –14.87, p &lt; .001, r = 0.59; GAD-7: Z = –14.59, p &lt; .001, r = 0.58), suggesting potential mental health benefits.

Discussion: The findings support the self-medication hypothesis, indicating that individuals may turn to psychedelics for relief from mental distress, resulting in improved symptoms of depression and anxiety. However, the study’s reliance on self-reported data and lack of clinical control limits the ability to establish causal relationships. Further research should investigate the therapeutic potential and risks of psychedelic use in Japan’s cultural context. These findings highlight the need for culturally sensitive drug policies and continued exploration of psychedelic use outside clinical settings.",Psychology
988,,"From birth until death animals resist gravity, effortfully asserting bodily form, animate behaviour, and postural balance. Most basic negentropic behaviours are understood as homeostasis (e.g. thermoregulation), but balance is taken to be an exception. Many studies have elucidated its sub-mechanisms, but the existence of goal-oriented homeostatic organisation remains an open question. The current theoretical paper reviews existing work to highlight and challenge the assumptions that belie a homeostatic model, arguing that balance is organised as one aspect of wider mechano-homeostasis, by a control loop organisationally akin to thermoregulation. The biophysical cost of maintaining an agent-medium density gradient defines the task, which is the regulation of mechanical force. Organism-level mechano-homeostasis must approximately maintain a certain mechanical force field at the surface of the organism (i.e. that which precisely cancels gravitational acceleration), or the organism will fall, dissipate and die. The argument specifies this fluid, dynamical force field of ‘balance’ for arbitrary morphologies and configurations, and describes how animals apprehend it developmentally for their own embodiment. I motivate and define this model, examine it against existing evidence, and discuss its implications, limitations and scope for understanding the embodied organisation of balance and spatiotemporal animacy in animals and robots.",Psychology

This study investigated the impact of phonological and semantic similarities between words on spoken word recognition in toddlers. We presented 21-month-old English monolinguals with a Preferential Looking Task adapted to a priming paradigm while their eye movements were recorded with an eye-tracker. Participants were presented with a spoken word (prime) followed by a related or unrelated spoken word (target). The experiment included three conditions: Phonologically Related, where words share the initial phonemes (e.g., toe-toast); Semantically Related, where words share the initial phonemes and belong to the same category (e.g., turkey-turtle); and Unrelated, where words do not share the initial phonemes and do not belong to the same category (e.g., bubble-toast and box-turtle). Growth curve analyses revealed more target looks in the Unrelated condition than in the Phonologically Related condition and more looks in the Semantically Related condition than in the Unrelated and Phonologically Related conditions. These results suggest better word recognition when a word is both phonologically and semantically related than when it is unrelated or only phonologically related. Female toddlers demonstrated more pronounced word recognition than male toddlers. This study extends our understanding of the roles of phonological and semantic cues, as well as sex differences, in language processing among young toddlers.",Psychology
990,,"Emotion influences memory. Emotional intelligence contributes to regulate emotions in life activities, such as affective relationships, teamwork, or tolerance to frustration. A high score in emotional intelligence is usually related with high scores in other cognitive skills. Here we tested the relationship of emotional intelligence with two types of memory: autobiographical and everyday memory. Emotional intelligence was assessed through a short version of the EQ-i inventory. For memory evaluation we used Spanish adaptations of the Memory Functioning Questionnaire (MFQ), the Autobiographical Memory Test (AMT), the Memory Characteristics Questionnaire (MCQ), and an historically updated version of the Past Events Questionnaire (PEQ). Regression analysis showed a positive relation among the interpersonal factor of emotional intelligence and autobiographical memory. On the contrary, the intrapersonal emotional intelligence showed a negative relation with everyday memory (memory for routines and practical aspects of everyday life).  This opposite sign relationship suggests that while social interaction enhances autobiographical memories, internal introspection reduces everyday memory, likely due to motivational aspects in both cases. In addition to emphasizing the importance of interpersonal relationships for cognitive aspects, the results also point to a specific memory deficit (everyday memory) in people with high scores in intrapersonal intelligence as measured by EQ-i.",Psychology
991,,"An intricate link exists between metabolic dysfunction and psychiatric disease. Documented deficits in systemic and brain metabolism are seen in several major mental illnesses: schizophrenia (SZ), bipolar disorder (BD), and major depressive disorder (MDD). We apply lessons from neurology on metabolic signaling between the central nervous system and periphery, metabolic plasticity, and the impact of targeting bioenergetic dysfunction on disease. Targeting this energetic dysfunction may lead to wide-ranging treatment strategies. The epidemics of obesity, metabolic syndrome, and insulin resistance, coupled with the global impact of mental illness, represent an unmet need and gap in psychiatric care. While life saving, some common psychiatric medications can impart undesirable metabolic side effects on an already vulnerable metabolic system. The increased prevalence of metabolic abnormalities among patients with major mental illness and evidence of shared environmental and genetic risk factors have led to a growing interest in understanding underlying biological mechanisms. These factors suggest that addressing metabolic dysfunction, centrally or peripherally, is critical to managing psychiatric illness. Therefore, we propose the incorporation of a metabolic framework into standard clinical psychiatric assessment. The emerging field of metabolic psychiatry explores the physiologic and molecular changes underpinning metabolic dysfunction and psychiatric disease with an aim to identify potential therapeutic and prevention targets. This perspective piece provides a conceptual framework for metabolic psychiatry, linking cerebral glucose hypometabolism, insulin resistance, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neural network instability in mental illness. We provide a synopsis of the current state of knowledge, where our gaps in understanding lie, and the future directions of incorporating metabolic mechanisms into psychiatric treatment strategies.",Psychology

In Study 1 (N = 474), a factorial survey experiment showed that low-status immigrants were viewed more favorably when they exhibited deservingness traits. Studies 2a (N = 1,506) and 2b (N = 1,255), conducted as one-week longitudinal studies during the 2024 European and French parliamentary elections, revealed that an information treatment emphasizing deservingness cues strongly reduced misperceptions about immigrants, modestly reduced opposition to immigration, and had an even smaller effect for anti-immigration voting. These findings suggest that while immigrants are often perceived negatively, emphasizing perceived deservingness can mitigate prejudice, presenting a promising strategy for reducing anti-immigration bias.",Psychology
996,,"Numeric ratings of agreement (also known as Likert-scales) are one of the most common assessment tools in psychology. However, little is known about the measurement theoretic properties of such ratings. Most prominently, the question whether such ratings yield interval scaled measurements has been questioned on theoretical grounds, the key issue being that interval scales do not only require ratings to be order preserving, but also additive. In this article, I apply a representational measurement model to investigate intra-individual response structures with regard to Likert-scale items. The model is borrowed from the psychophysical paradigm of cross-modality comparisons and allows for an explicit empirical test of additivity on the level of individual responses.  A within-subjects experiment with N = 140 individuals was conducted, where subjects were instructed to rate their agreement to a set of items from a standardized personality questionnaire. The ratings were performed repeatedly with varying reference stimuli to evoke difference ratings for agreement. These difference ratings were then used to test the conditions of the measurement model. The results indicate that 51% of the individuals showed additivity in their rating behavior. Therefore, an interval scale representation of subjective agreement was possible for about one half of the individuals, whereas the other half did not produce agreement ratings on an interval scale. While the results clearly demonstrate that interval scale measurements using numeric ratings are possible, they also indicate that such quantitative representations should not be taken at face value but need to be tested empirically.",Psychology
997,,"Background: In China, English is mandatory for all 8 to 9 year olds, and executive function is a key predictor of English achievement. However, prior studies have overlooked either the multidimensionality of English assessments or the component nature of executive function, resulting in inconsistent findings.
Aims: This study simultaneously examines the relationships between executive function components (inhibitory control, working memory, cognitive flexibility) and English academic performance (listening, reading, writing), aiming to resolve literature controversies and establish a foundation for further causal exploration.
Samples: The sample comprises 863 Chinese primary school students from the third to the fifth grade.
Methods: A cross-sectional study employing network analysis and comparison was conducted to examine the relationship between executive function and English academic performance in Chinese primary school students.
Results: The results indicate that working memory updating exerts a significant influence on various aspects of English academic performance. Working memory span and cognitive flexibility positively predict English writing, while response inhibition is the strongest predictor of reading. Regarding gender differences, working memory span negatively predicts listening in males, whereas it has a stronger positive impact on overall English academic performance in females.
Conclusions: This study reveals the complex relationships between executive function components and various aspects of English academic performance, establishing a foundation for exploring their causal links and offering empirical support for targeted teaching strategies.",Psychology

This phenomenon was first documented by Purkinje over 200 years ago. Since then, significant progress has been made in understanding the effects of stroboscopic light and the experiences it induces through multiple waves of interest from the scientific, therapeutic, and broader cultural communities. Despite these advances, fundamental questions remain unanswered, including comprehensive characterisations of its phenomenology, its precise physiological origins, under which conditions it may lead to altered states of consciousness phenomena, and potential clinical or therapeutic applications.

However, previous studies exploring the relationship between academic stress and executive function have produced inconsistent findings, either neglecting the multidimensionality of academic stress or overlooking the separability of executive function. Therefore, this study employed a cross-lagged panel network analysis to investigate the longitudinal relationship between various types of academic stress and the subcomponents of executive function among 620 Chinese high school students. The findings revealed that self-imposed stress had the strongest positive predictive effect on working memory updating and working memory span. In contrast, teacher stress exerted the most crucial negative predictive effect on working memory updating and response inhibition, while social stress showed a lesser negative predictive effect on response inhibition. Notably, self-imposed stress mediated the relationship between parental stress and both working memory updating and working memory span. Furthermore, self-imposed stress and teacher stress were identified as the most crucial “high bridge centrality nodes” within the network, indicating key intervention targets. The study's conclusions offer valuable insights for educators in formulating effective strategies to help high school students manage academic stress.",Psychology
1000,,"Abstractness, i.e., the capability to form and use abstract concepts, like “fantasy”, is pivotal to human cognition. Abstract concepts come in different kinds and are characterized by sensorimotor, interoceptive, emotional, linguistic, and social aspects to various degrees. In this Perspective, we propose a social route to abstractness, highlighting the role of social interaction and conceptual flexibility. We distinguish two notions: “socialness,” the idea that abstract concepts evoke more social aspects than concrete concepts, and “social metacognition,” a process that includes a monitoring and an interactive phase. Because abstract concepts do not have perceptually similar referents and their meaning is often indeterminate, people monitor their knowledge of abstract knowledge longer, feel more uncertain, and use inner speech more. Other people’s support is more critical to acquiring abstract concepts and, once acquired, to aligning and co-building conceptual meaning. Our view introduces a further semantic dimension, vagueness, which leads to a distinction between abstract concepts with more determined meaning, like some scientific and magnitude concepts, and abstract concepts whose meaning remains vague and socially negotiable. Our perspective connects literature on concepts, knowledge outsourcing, knowledge communities, and political polarization.",Psychology

Dewey (1934) suggested that all human experience, including art experiences, emerges from active engagement with the environment. In this view, affect and interpretation are interconnected processes that unfold together. To examine the integration of these processes, this interdisciplinary study used a multi-method approach. Eighteen dyads of adult participants took part in the study. They were instructed to each bring an art object that was meaningful to them. During the experiment participants engaged in an audio-visually recorded, semi-structured conversation, reflecting on both art objects. They also answered pre- and post-questionnaires on their emotions. The sense-making process was coded in terms of four strategies, namely: perception, imagination, conceptualisation, and analysis (van Heusden, 2015). Affect in sense-making was measured through self-reported valence and arousal of emotions, and sentiment analysis of the conversation. The results showed that dyadic interactions led to significant changes, at the group level, in participants’ self-reported affect toward the other’s art object. An Exploratory Graph Analysis revealed unique weighted networks of sentiment for each strategy. Additionally, a Multinomial Log-linear Model demonstrated that affect and strategies work in tandem during the sense-making process, to predict perceived affect.",Psychology

However, the neural differences in processing orthographic neighbours versus predicted words in high-constraint sentence contexts remain underexplored. This study used fixation-related fields (FRF) with eye-tracking and magnetoencephalography (MEG) to capture participants’ eye movements and neural responses during naturalistic sentence reading. Experimental sentences included four conditions based on target words’ plausibility: plausible words (PC), implausible orthographic neighbours with last- (LD) or first-letter deviations (ED) from the PC target words, and unrelated words (UC). Results revealed longer first fixation durations and larger N400m FRF responses for the LD, ED, and UC than for the PC. The ED elicited larger P600m FRF responses than the LD and PC. The left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) showed increased activity for the ED and UC than the PC during both the N400m and P600m time windows. The left temporal cortex exhibited stronger activity for the PC than the ED during the N400m time window. During the P600m time window, compared with the PC, increased right IFG activity was observed for the LD, while the right insula cortex showed greater involvement for the LD and ED. This study highlights the impact of orthographic form in sentence reading, demonstrating that even one-letter deviations significantly affect fixation-related brain responses. These findings uncover distinct neural processes for handling orthographic and semantic deviations, emphasizing the role of the left and right IFG and the right insula cortex in processing orthographic neighbours during naturalistic sentence reading.",Psychology
1003,,"The regression paradox, also called the reverse regression problem, is a phenomenon where the effect of X on Y when adjusting for Z and the effect of X on Z when adjusting for Y can suggest diametrically different circumstances. In data from the National Longitudinal Study of Youth (NLSY) 1979 (N = 12,686) and 1997 (N = 8984), we demonstrate the regression paradox and show that respondents’ fathers’ level of education had a positive effect on the respondents’ wages when adjusting for their intelligence. This could be seen to indicate favoritism of the highborn and discrimination against the lowborn. However, the same data revealed a positive effect of fathers’ education on respondents’ intelligence when adjusting for their wages, suggesting, paradoxically, discrimination against the highborn and favoritism of the lowborn. As fathers’ education had a stronger correlation with the respondents’ intelligence than with their wages, we also found a positive effect of fathers’ education on the respondents’ wage - intelligence difference score, suggesting that the highborn had not fully capitalized on their high intelligence. We propose that estimating effects on difference scores can be used to avoid the regression paradox and to scrutinize adjusted regression effects.",Psychology

Our findings indicate that LLMs poorly capture the moral diversity around the globe, systematically overestimating some moral values (especially Care) and underestimating others (especially Purity). Notably, examining various versions of GPT shows that these LLMs may overestimate the overall moral concerns of some Western countries (e.g., United States, Canada, and Australia) while underestimating those of non-Western countries (e.g., Nigeria, Morocco, and Indonesia). Our work reveals that LLMs are inaccurate generators of cross-cultural estimations in the moral domain; in other words, they stereotype the moral values of cultural populations in predictable ways. Our results highlight the ethical and epistemic risks of relying on LLMs to estimate the endorsement of moral values around the globe.",Psychology

This finding holds and is concerning regardless of our ability to identify an alternative class of models that performs better. We then further showed that Bayesian random effects models incorporating explicit assumptions about the data-generating process do indeed perform much better. In particular, the Bayesian model controlling for spatial proximity was most effective at reducing false positives in spatially non-independent data, and the Bayesian model controlling for linguistic proximity was most effective at reducing false positives in “language tree” non-independent data.",Psychology

Both genetic and environmental factors contribute to this stability in aggressive behavior throughout life. Specifically, genetic influences on aggression vary before age 25, with qualitative genetic differences as indicated by the emergence of new genetic factors, and quantitative differences as indicated by  fluctuations in the heritability during this period. The heritability of aggressive behavior was highest around age 12 (.74) and then decreases to about .40 to .50 throughout life. After age 25, no new genetic factors contribute to individual differences in aggression, such that the genetic architecture of aggressive behavior does not change throughout the remainder of the lifespan. These findings have implications for understanding the etiology of aggressive behavior from a developmental perspective.",Psychology
1008,,"Affordances were introduced to psychology explicitly as a hypothesis about how meaning gets into perception. The affordance hypothesis is an alternative to the classical hypothesis that meaningful perception involves classification. According to the affordance hypothesis, patterns in ambient energy contain information about the meanings of things in the environment. The affordance hypothesis postulates that by detecting this information, the animal is able to directly detect the meaning, without any intervening act of classification or categorization. We identify two longstanding problems for affordances as an empirical research program: 1) the operationalization problem, i.e. how to study affordances without falling back into categorical thinking; 2) the discontinuity problem, i.e. how to explain the fact that humans do classify things, even if others animals do not. We discuss some possible solutions to these problems, and propose some guidelines for future empirical research.",Psychology
1009,,"The PHQ-4 is an ultra-brief (4 items) screening questionnaire for depression and anxiety. In this
brief report, we test the benefits of adding one additional response option (“Once or twice”, in
between “Not at all” and “Several days”) to improve the scale’s sensitivity to milder alterations,
and thus increase its usefulness in subclinical populations. In study 1 (N=485), we provide
evidence using Item Response Theory (IRT) that the new response option does improve the
scale’s psychometric quality and extends the sensitivity to the measured constructs on the lower
end of the spectrum. In study 2 (N=836), we show that the refined version offers an improved
sensitivity to subclinical variability in depression (indexed by the BDI-II) as compared to the
original version. In conclusion, adding the “once or twice” response option is a low-cost no-downsides way of increasing the PHQ-4’s sensitivity to subclinical variability, making it a tool
of choice for general population research.",Psychology
1010,,"Vision is often understood as a hierarchical, feedforward process, where visual processing proceeds from low-level features to high-level representations, ultimately resulting in a coherent percept. Within just a few tens of milliseconds, the fundamental features of the percept are established. These traditional models are the primary framework for understanding visual crowding, a perceptual phenomenon where the perception of a target is impaired by the presence of flanking elements. In this framework, the early stages of feedforward visual processing are essential for perceiving stimuli under crowding conditions and temporal aspects are not important. In fact, experiments show that stimulus duration affects perception very little with classic crowding displays. Here, we show that for more complex displays, crowding is the outcome of highly dynamic processes. For example, a 20 ms preview of just the flankers can reduce crowding for displays with the target and the same flankers presented up to 1 second later. This effect occurs only if the flankers have the potential to group during longer stimulus durations. Our findings align with predictions made by the LAMINART model, which employs recurrent segmentation processes unfolding over time to separate objects into distinct representation layers. Taken together, our results highlight the importance of time-consuming grouping processes in spatial and temporal interactions in vision. In contrast to the classic feedforward models of vision, we propose that crowding, and vision in general, is a dynamic process in which multiple potential interpretations of a stimulus are modulated and gated by grouping mechanisms that evolve over time.",Psychology
1011,,"Previous work suggests that target selection during visual foraging is achieved through competition between different factors (e.g., proximity, priming) that orient attention towards one of the possible targets. However, this research has mainly involved simple stimuli such as coloured dots. Here, we investigated whether target selection is sensitive to the emotional content of the stimuli during visual foraging, using real-world photographs eliciting negative, neutral or positive emotions. Moreover, based on results from single-target visual search, we examined how participants’ trait anxiety influences foraging behaviour. Seventy-five observers completed three foraging tasks corresponding to three emotional-valence conditions (positive, neutral, negative). The task was to select all the targets (pre-specified emotional images) as fast as possible, while ignoring neutral distractors. Observers’ foraging strategy (i.e., selection order, number of switches between target types) and performance (i.e., selection times, number of distractor selections) were measured. We also assessed participants’ trait anxiety. The results revealed that negative emotional stimuli significantly influenced both foraging strategy and performance. Furthermore, the effect of negative emotion on foraging performance was amplified for participants with high trait anxiety. These findings suggest that emotional processing contributes to target selection and emphasize the importance of using ecologically valid stimuli in visual-foraging research.",Psychology
1012,,"Empathy is essential for human social interaction; however, extending empathy toward individuals with dissimilar characteristics facing daily challenges may be difficult. In this study, we examined how people without disabilities empathize with individuals with disabilities, specifically those with stroke-induced hemiplegia, during manual interactions with objects or other people. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging and multi voxel pattern analysis (MVPA), we explored the neural and behavioral mechanisms underlying empathy in these contexts. Participants observed video stimuli featuring individuals with hemiplegia performing tasks such as grasping a human hand or an object (a plastic bottle), using either their hemiplegic or non-hemiplegic hands. Behavioral responses revealed stronger negative empathic feelings toward hemiplegic movements than non-hemiplegic ones, regardless of the grasping targets. Positive empathic feelings were more pronounced while observing interactions involving human hands than those involving objects, particularly when performed using the hemiplegic hand. Furthermore, classification approaches in MVPA revealed that parts of the mirror neuron system and mentalizing networks distinguished empathic responses to interactions with human hands and objects commonly across hemiplegic and non-hemiplegic hands. Additionally, the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) more accurately classified empathic responses for hemiplegic than non-hemiplegic movements, reflecting the complexity of empathizing with unfamiliar actions. Representational similarity analysis revealed that brain regions associated with affective empathy were specifically attuned to feelings of relief across experimental conditions. These findings suggest that both affective and cognitive brain systems are engaged when empathizing with individuals with different characteristics who face complex challenges. Moreover, the dorsal MPFC plays a substantial role in facilitating precise empathic responses to hemiplegic movements. Moreover, the affective system is particularly fine-tuned to positive feelings, such as relief. Our findings improve the understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying empathy in diverse social contexts.",Psychology
1013,,"Schizophrenia is a complex psychiatric disorder with a multifactorial etiology, 
encompassing genetic, environmental, and neurobiological factors. Recent 
research has increasingly pointed to the roles of the immune system and gut 
microbiome in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Immune dysfunction, 
characterized by systemic inflammation, altered cytokine profiles, and microglial 
activation, has been implicated in the development of neuroinflammation, a key 
feature of the disorder. Furthermore, disruptions in the gut microbiome, or 
dysbiosis, have been associated with increased inflammation, altered 
neurotransmitter metabolism, and impaired immune modulation, all of which may 
contribute to the onset and progression of schizophrenia. The gut-brain axis, which
facilitates bidirectional communication between the gastrointestinal system and 
the brain, is emerging as a critical pathway in the interplay between the immune 
system and microbiome. This review explores the growing evidence for the 
involvement of immune and microbiome dysregulation in schizophrenia, 
highlighting the mechanisms through which these systems interact and influence 
brain function. Understanding the complex relationship between immune and

1015,,"Importance: There is a need for tools for measuring social gaze as it manifests during social interactions to establish its value as a biobehavioral marker and individual difference measure.

Objective: To automatically measure features of social gaze from videos of dyadic conversations, characterize individual differences in autism, and perform individual-level diagnostic classification. 

Design: Participants engaged in a 3-4-minute get-to-know-you conversation with a research staff member (Partner) while video-recording facial behaviors. 

Setting: Lab-based study at an academic medical center. 

Participants: The sample included 82 Participants, aged 8-29 years, with autism (AUT, n=46; 29 male) or neurotypical development (NT, n=36; 21 male).

Main Outcomes and Measures: A deep learning AI model was trained using face, eye, and head features to detect whether each conversation partner was looking at the other person. Generalized linear regression was used to examine diagnosis-related differences in looking patterns, covarying for age, sex, IQ, conversation length, and Partner looking behavior. A machine learning model using gaze features was trained for diagnostic classification.

Results: AI achieved 89% cross-validated accuracy in detecting social gaze; AI-detected social gaze correlated with global eye contact ratings from conversation Partners (r = 0.43, p &lt; 0.01). Compared to NT peers, autistic Participants spent less time looking at Partners (Cohen’s d = 0.66, FDR-corrected q &lt; 0.01) and engaging in mutual gaze (d = 0.88, q &lt; 0.01). They also initiated mutual gaze less frequently (d = 0.28, q &lt; 0.01), had shorter mutual gaze episodes (d = 0.79, q &lt; 0.01), and displayed longer delays before joining mutual gazes (d = 0.49, q &lt; 0.01), but did not differ in mutual gaze counts (d = 0.11, q = 0.26). An AI-derived social gaze summary score correlated specifically with ADOS-2 Social Affect scores (r = 0.47, p &lt; 0.01) and not Restricted and Repetitive Behavior scores (r = 0.12, p = 0.54). Machine learning yielded a cross-validated diagnostic classification accuracy of 73%.

Conclusions and Relevance: Our approach accurately quantified features of social gaze during natural interactions not currently measurable using traditional or AI-based approaches. Automated social gaze measurements accurately predicted individual differences in autism, offering a promising new target for a biobehavioral marker.",Psychology

Our findings showed that “humanity” traits were favored over “success” traits by the large majority of respondents but that the remaining respondents tended to be low in Honesty-Humility and to some extent in Agreeableness (versus Anger) and Emotionality.  Respondents showed a weak preference for intelligence over the other success traits; preferences for those traits were similar for prospective sons and prospective daughters, but athleticism was slightly favored among sons and attractiveness was slightly favored among daughters.

1019,,"Introduction: Internal displacement is a traumatic experience that may disrupt neurocognitive functions essential for adolescents’ learning and well-being. Scarce data address these effects in internally displaced adolescents. This study examined the impact of internal displacement on cognitive ability and executive functioning by comparing displaced adolescents with non-displaced peers and exploring socioeconomic status as moderating factor.
Materials and methods: A random sample of 130 displaced adolescents and 139 controls completed cognitive ability and executive functioning standardized assessments. Parents provided socioeconomic information on income, education, and occupation. Outcome variables included intelligence quotient (IQ), cognitive domain scores, an executive functioning (EF) score, and executive domain scores. General Linear and multivariate models were conducted to test our hypotheses.

Results: According to Hypothesis 1, internally displaced adolescents scored lower on IQ and EF scores, particularly in working memory, compared to controls. The effect of forced displacement remained significant even after adjusting for socioeconomic factors. Contrary to Hypothesis 2, no moderating effects of socioeconomic variables on displacement were found for IQ or EF scores.

Discussion: Internal displacement may negatively impact adolescents' cognitive and executive skills, particularly working memory. The cognitive ability results align with prior studies on displaced populations, like refugees, though the executive functioning findings do not. These mixed outcomes may be due to sample and design variations across studies. Internal displacement could represent a unique form of adversity that impacts cognitive and executive skills in distinct ways. Future studies should use larger samples to increase precision and examine how socioeconomic factors and cumulative adversities shape the effects of internal displacement on adolescents. The potential role of cognitive and executive skills in mitigating displacement impacts is also suggested.",Psychology
1020,,"The sunk-cost effect, an influential decision-making bias elicited by the consideration of past, irrecoverable resource investments toward a choice option, is well-documented for economic decisions. Contrary, evidence for sunk-cost effects for non-monetary costs, such as cognitive effort, has been mixed. Here, we present findings from two experiments (in-person study: N=36; online study: N=89), in which healthy participants performed an effort investment task designed to assess the impact of past effort exertion on current choices about continuing or abandoning a course of action. Across both experiments, we found that prior effort investment substantially increased participants’ willingness to invest further resources (i.e., to exert additional effort). These findings provide compelling evidence for the existence of an effort-based sunk-cost effect. Further, they highlight the importance of previous effort investments for influencing present choice behavior, indicating the need to refine contemporary cost-benefit models of effort to account for past effort exertion.",Psychology

Latent profile analyses uncovered three profiles that differentiated between their level of engagement in both latent and manifest forms of political participation: “informed enthusiasts” (90%), “activists” (7%), and “involved conventionalists” (2%). Political efficacy, national identity commitment, and perceived ethnic discrimination were predictive of profile membership, while political alienation and national identity exploration and reconsideration were not.

Understanding the interaction between PIU symptoms and identifying the core PIU symptoms that drive distinct trajectories among adolescents are crucial. We employed cross-lagged panel network analysis to examine the temporal relationships of PIU symptoms among Chinese adolescents across four developmental trajectories over two time points. A total of 27,577 adolescents (Mean age = 13.8, SD = 1.5) participated in this study. Demographic variables and PIU symptoms were collected from December 17 to 26, 2021 (T1) and from May 17 to June 5, 2022 (T2). The symptom “Reluctant to stop” in the resilient group and “Uncontrollable checking” in the alleviating group at T1 were most predictive of remission of other symptoms at T2, while “Empty life” in the deteriorating group and “Feeling of missing” in the persistent dysfunction group were most strongly associated with the worsening of other PIU symptoms. Improving self-control over internet use is likely to promote healthy and beneficial Internet use among adolescents, while enhancing social connection and fostering exercise habits may help mitigate negative emotions and reduce the emergence of additional PIU symptoms among adolescents who have developed PIU.",Psychology

Aside from visual percepts emerging in participants’ awareness, Ganzfeld viewing is characterized by decays of color and brightness. The studies dedicated to this topic from the 20th century have focused on these decays, although they have been reported in a confusing way, with different terms for these decaying experiences. This paper synthesizes the current state of the Ganzfeld literature going back to the 1930s with the purpose of clarifying the terminology of the phenomena that have largely retained their mysterious aspects. We built a Ganzfeld space to study the phenomenology without the restricted feeling of a confined space that translucent Ganzfeld goggles cause. Employing a multi-method approach, we combined quantitative and qualitative measures to grasp the number, kind and temporal dynamics of the experienced phenomena as well as their experiential characteristics better. We offer more insight into the different kinds of visual percepts that emerge in participants’ awareness, induced by the Ganzfeld, and we identified three distinct types of decays of color and brightness. We termed these “fade-out”, “black-out” and “blank-out”, and present both the prevalence as well as the qualitative characteristics of these decays. Finally, we shed some light onto the role of eye movements and blinks on the experienced phenomena. All of this is important groundwork to be able to study the dynamics of different Ganzfeld experiences, in relation to different states of consciousness and their neural correlates in future work.",Psychology
1024,,"Reading fluency and spelling accuracy depend on the presence of well-specified orthographic representations in the mental lexicon (Perfetti &amp; Hart, 2002). The richness of a child’s orthographic lexicon is likely to depend on the efficiency of orthographic learning. This, in turn, may be influenced by their ability to form an a priori expectation of the word’s spelling, which is likely to be based on their knowledge of frequent letter patterns in their orthography (graphotactic sensitivity). This proposed causal chain may explain the link between statistical learning ability and reading, as graphotactic sensitivity is likely to be acquired by statistical learning. In this pre-registered study, we tested the feasibility of this proposed causal chain, by testing 94 children learning to read in German on tasks testing each of these steps: spelling accuracy, reading fluency, orthographic choice (measuring lexical knowledge), orthographic learning, as well as sensitivity to graphotactic regularities. Although the performance on tasks reflecting orthographic knowledge or learning is correlated, we found no evidence for a link between graphotactic sensitivity and reading, spelling, or orthographic learning. This suggests that a proposed effect of statistical learning is unlikely to be a result of mediation via graphotactic sensitivity and orthographic learning.",Psychology
1025,,"Social comparison manifests in multiple situations, including academic and interpersonal contexts,
and certainly has its advantages. However, it must be acknowledged that social comparison is to 
some extent associated with rivalry and aggression. Some aggression theories suggest that it is not 
the outcome of social comparison (e.g., disadvantage) but rather the sole fact of social comparison
that is the driving force of aggression. Since empirical evidence for the proposed impact of 
outcome-independent social comparison itself on aggression is still missing, a first experimental 
test of this hypothesis was provided here. Study 1 (N=1619; 854 males, 52.7%; 765 females, 47.3%; 
mean age = 50.34 years, SDage = 13.22; German sample) confirmed that social comparison alone

females, 45.6%; mean age = 56.87 years, SDage = 14.38; German sample), a preregistered direct

demonstrating that social comparison itself can be the origin of aggression independent of an 
outcome. This is relevant to social science, organizational psychology, pedagogy, and everyday 
experiences.",Psychology
1026,,"Pro-environmental behavior is often conceptualized as a trade-off between environmental benefits and the associated costs: a person engages in a pro-environmental behavior if the value of the environmental benefit outweighs the time, effort, or money required to generate it. However, pro-environmental behavior does not occur in a vacuum: behaving pro-environmentally most often implies not engaging in competing behaviors, but the associated opportunity costs have rarely been considered in previous work. Here, we study pro-environmental behavior as an effort-based decision-making process to better understand how pro-environmental behavior is shaped by the costs and benefits of competing behavioral options. In two studies (N = 115, N = 255), participants were asked to choose between exerting effort to obtain monetary rewards either for themselves or for the environment. By manipulating reward magnitude and effort level of each option orthogonally, we found that smaller environmental rewards led to increased effort discounting, that is, the level of effort affected decisions more at low levels of environmental reward. This effect was especially strong when the alternative (self-benefitting) option was effortful and/or carried low incentive value, suggesting that the effort related to pro-environmental behavior is most relevant at low opportunity cost.",Psychology

1028,,"Understanding individual differences in cognitive reserve is key to predicting, and potentially influencing, factors that promote healthy cognitive aging. It has been suggested that individuals who are more curious engage in more stimulating activities and thereby increase their cognitive reserve. In the present study, we investigated the relationships between dimensions of trait curiosity and different proxies of cognitive reserve - education, occupation, and leisure activities - in groups of younger and middle-to-older aged adults. Our results provide evidence for a relationship between multiple dimensions of trait curiosity and cognitive reserve, which was more pronounced in later adulthood. In the middle-to-older age group, all proxies of cognitive reserve were related to curiosity, albeit to different dimensions of the trait: higher interest-based epistemic curiosity and perceptual curiosity predicted higher education and leisure activities. In contrast, deprivation-sensitive curiosity was positively associated with occupation, but negatively associated with leisure. In the young group, only leisure activities were significantly predicted by perceptual curiosity. This study adds to the emerging literature on the role of personality in cognitive reserve and highlights the multifaceted influence of trait curiosity, which is larger in older age.",Psychology

Across two studies, we explored (Study 1, N = 408) then attempted to confirm (Study 2, N = 423) whether and where a collection of &gt;25 RST scales might be located within the space of the Big Five. Both studies revealed that more than 70% of these RST scales were more strongly related to the Big Five domains than more than 10% (i.e., 3/30) of Big Five facets, suggesting that they too could plausibly be regarded as Big Five facets. Moreover, several RST scales were highly correlated (r &gt; .80) with individual Big Five facets, indicating potential redundancy. These results suggest that the Big Five can indeed provide a useful organising framework for most RST scales, which may help researchers grappling with construct proliferation and jingle-jangle fallacies within the RST literature.",Psychology
1031,,"Having an abstract understanding of communication means being able to reason not just about its success but also its failure: when and why it fails, what happens as a consequence, and how to fix it. Auditory noise in particular can radically alter the fidelity of verbal communication, yet little is known about how language users reason about its role in communication and when such reasoning emerges in development. The current work investigates the development of children’s reasoning about auditory noise. As observers of others' communication, we found that a sample of US children as young as age three understood that auditory noise impedes others’ hearing, though the ability to reason about its effect on others’ knowledge and behaviors may not develop until slightly later. As communicators, a separate sample of four-year-olds tailored how they themselves communicated by using more gestures when their partner couldn't hear. Taken together, these results suggest that even young children may possess an abstract understanding of communication that is integrated with their ability to reason about others’ perception and knowledge. Such an understanding enables children to reason about how noise disrupts communication and how to communicate effectively in the presence of noise.",Psychology

But not all self-communicative behaviors have clear or empirically defined social cognitive connections, and the concept of intrapersonal communication deserves revisiting through meaningful interdisciplinary study using varied methods and theoretical frameworks. We explore relevant work supporting our contention that intrapersonal communication constitutes a valuable classification, including related historical research, functional and developmental approaches, and important methodological issues.

However, some research suggests that many providers do not implement EBPs as intended. Ongoing quality monitoring is needed to support EBP implementation and sustainability, but “gold standard” fidelity monitoring (e.g. observer ratings) is time-consuming, requires extensive training, and may feel intrusive to providers and clients.  In the current study, we aimed to develop a scalable method of assessing CBT fidelity that leverages information generated in routine clinical care (e.g. session worksheets and clinician checklists). Ratings of adherence based on worksheets were not correlated with ratings of adherence based on observer ratings. However, ratings of competence based on worksheets were significantly correlated with observer ratings of competence. Ratings of adherence based on clinician checklist ratings were also significantly correlated with observer-rated adherence. Results did not indicate a strong relationship between adherence or competence measured by worksheet ratings or observer and symptom change. However, adherence as measured by clinician checklists were associated with subsequent depression symptom change. Findings have a strong potential to impact fidelity monitoring strategies for a variety of CBTs. Given the limited resources and time to do full audio review in routine care settings, findings suggest that using routine materials generated in session to assess therapist competence may be a feasible alternative to the “gold standard” audio review.",Psychology

Method. To gather insights into user needs and preferences, we conducted 13 semi-structured interviews with adult participants in Germany that reported to have sexual problems. Interviews were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Categories were established deductively-inductively from transcribed interview records based on a rigorous coding method.
Results. Key findings revealed that expert knowledge and destigmatization are crucial components for a potential IMI for sexual dysfunctions and well-being. Preferred content topics included communication, dealing with sexualized violence, and sexual preferences. The design should prioritize clarity, customizability, and neutrality. While most participants were open to using a potential IMI with their partners and preferred on-demand professional support, the study also highlighted the importance of avoiding insensitivity and inappropriate content related to sexual abuse. 
Conclusions. This study underlines the importance of developing an IMI targeting sexual problems that is inclusive, responsive to diverse user needs, and adaptable to various psychotherapeutic contexts.",Psychology
1038,,"Humans can mentally create and elaborately describe events, detailing not just the who, what, and where, but also the connections and intricacies of these elements. Propositional density, the number of propositions expressed relative to total words, can be leveraged to assess how elaborately the elements of memories are described. The present study used propositional density to investigate how age relates to the elaborateness of orally shared autobiographical event memories. This preregistered study included 114 young adults (mean age = 24.1) and 171 cognitively normal older adults (mean age = 68.3). Propositional density scores were calculated using Computerized Propositional Idea Density Rater (CPIDR). In addition to conducting a young versus older adult comparison, we separated older adults into “younger-old” and “older-old” groups and compared propositional density scores for these groups and the young adult group. Propositional density was higher in young adults than older adults, Cohen’s f = 0.13, p = .029, which was driven by propositional density being significantly higher in young adults than older-old adults, Cohen’s f = 0.15, p = .027. No other significant group differences were found. In a sample of older adults, propositional density scores on past- and future-oriented tasks were significantly correlated, ρ = .43, p &lt; .001. In advanced older age, many individuals may display lower propositional density in spoken autobiographical event memories, possibly reflecting that the elements of memories are less elaborately described in this population.",Psychology

1040,,"Category learning is the ability to link items to a shared label based on their common features. Despite being important for individuals of all ages, there is little research on how older age affects category learning and generalization. Moreover, there is no research, to date, on the extent to which individuals tend to adopt the same categorization strategy across different to-be-learned categories. In this study, healthy young (aged 18-30, n = 77) and older adults (aged 60+, n = 74) completed two categorization tasks in separate sessions approximately 48 hours apart, with the category structures remaining constant across sessions but the stimuli differing. We compared categorization accuracy and prototype versus exemplar model fits across age groups and across sessions. In both sessions, there was an age deficit specific to learning items near the category boundary. Despite differences during learning, there were no significant age differences in generalization performance. Fitting formal prototype and exemplar models revealed a comparable proportion of young and older adults best fit by the prototype model overall, but a continuous measure of prototype model fit advantage showed higher correlation across sessions in older compared to young adults. Together, these findings show that older adults consistently rely on typical training items to learn categories and are more stable in their prototype strategy use than young adults, which can be effective in supporting generalization performance at young-adult levels.",Psychology
1041,,"It is common for mastectomy patients to present with sensorimotor symptoms that can affect the execution of voluntary movements, which engages endogenous motor representations. It is therefore necessary to expand our knowledge of motor representations in mastectomy patients to propose novel and complementary tools to conventional rehabilitation. The investigation of such motor representations may be conducted through the utilisation of tasks that implicitly engage a motor imagery process. Accordingly, the aim of our study was to ascertain the impact of a unilateral mastectomy on motor representations, employing an implicit motor imagery task. To investigate this, seven mastectomy participants and ten matched healthy controls had to judge the laterality of hands presented in a different view (i.e., back and palm) and different orientations (i.e., 0°, 90° lateral, 90° medial and 180°). The results demonstrated that the mastectomy group exhibited a lower hit rate than the control participants and a longer response time, particularly for the palm view in postures that engaged significant biomechanical constraints (i.e., 90° lateral and 180°). These findings suggest that mastectomy procedure induce alterations in patients’ motor representations. Accordingly, we propose that the mastectomy participants had greater difficulty in simulating the movement that allowed them to rotate their own hand in order to align it with the hand image presented on the computer screen.",Psychology

Unlike previous photosets, the BRIC focused on non-realistic visuals. This collection includes abstract and non-abstract paintings, and non-realistic photographs depicting objects, scenes, animals, humans, and fantastical creatures with varying degrees of unreal elements. We collected evaluative ratings of the photos, using a convenience sample of 16,208 participants in a total of 25,321 sessions. We used multiple evaluation measures: binary positive/negative and like/dislike categorization, 7-point ratings on these attributes, both under no time pressure and under time pressure, and evaluative priming scores. The mean evaluation of the photos on the different measures was highly correlated, but some photos consistently elicited a discrepant evaluative reaction between the measures. The BRIC is a valuable resource for eliciting evaluative reactions and can contribute to research on evaluative processes and affective responses.",Psychology
1043,,"Modern speech technologies enable the artificial replication, or cloning, of the human voice. In the present study, we investigated whether listeners’ perception and social evaluation of state-of-the-art voice clones depend on whether the clone being heard is a replica of the self, a friend, or a total stranger. We recorded and cloned the voices of familiar pairs of adult participants. Forty-seven of these experimental participants (and 47 unfamiliar controls) rated the Trustworthiness, Attractiveness, Competence, and Dominance of cloned and recorded samples of their own voice and their friend’s voice. We observed that while familiar listeners found clones to sound less (or similarly) trustworthy, attractive, and competent than recordings, unfamiliar listeners showed an opposing profile in which clones tended to be rated higher than recordings. Within this, familiar listeners tended to prefer their friend’s voice to their own, although perceived similarity of both self- and friend-voice clones to the original speaker identity predicted higher ratings on all trait scales. Overall, we find that familiar listeners’ impressions are sensitive to the perceived accuracy and authenticity of cloning for voices they know well, while unfamiliar listeners tend to prefer the synthetic versions of those same voice identities. The latter observation may relate to the tendency of generative voice synthesis models to homogenise speaking accents and styles, such that they more closely approximate (preferred) norms.",Psychology
1044,,"Social exclusion or rejection is a universal stressor, and strong responses to rejection have been related to various mental health issues. Previous studies have shown that peer rejection and rejection reactivity are associated with concurrent activity in the insula, striatum, cingulate, parietal and prefrontal cortex. To date however, studies have only looked at peer rejection in relation to the state of the brain during rejection, not more stable brain characteristics. Identifying which brain areas are different among those that respond more to rejection could help us understand more of the biological underpinnings of those more sensitive to rejection and ultimately alleviate associated mental health issues. 
Here we studied how brain structure and resting state functional connectivity are related to rejection reactivity outside of the scanner, in a population-based sample of 1,814 9-to-12-year-olds. Observed emotional facial expressions and self-reported feelings during social exclusion were measured using the Cyberball paradigm, which took place outside of the MRI scanner. We assessed structural brain morphology using T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, white matter microstructure using diffusion tensor imaging, and functional connectivity using resting-state functional imaging. 
 	Stronger resting-state functional connectivity between the dorsal striatum, visual, and sensori-motor networks, and between the cingulo-operculum and dorsal attention network was positively related to negative emotional facial expressions during peer rejection. No associations were detected between functional connectivity and self-reported rejection reactivity, nor between gray or white matter (micro-)structure and observed or reported rejection reactivity. 
The dorsal striatum is related to automated behavior and the resting state functional connectivity between these and the other networks may indicate why some children are more expressive in their reaction to social exclusion. Moreover, the cingulo-operculum network overlaps with the insula and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, areas related to pain processing. These findings are in line with earlier studies showing a neural substrate for feeling ‘hurt’ when socially excluded, and indicate specific resting-state functional connectivity related to increased risk of feeling hurt.",Psychology

1048,,"Although anger is theorized to play a key role in the manifestation of non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI), prospective research in real-world settings is limited. Therefore, the present study examines (1) whether individuals with and without a history of NSSI differ in anger levels in their natural setting and (2) whether heightened self- or other-directed anger predicts NSSI cognitions (i.e., thoughts and self-efficacy to resist NSSI) and behavior in daily life. Using ecological momentary assessment in 60 emerging adults (ages 18–22) with and without past-year NSSI, participants completed eight daily surveys over 12 days, yielding 4,587 assessments (median compliance=83.3%; IQR=71.9–91.7). Emerging adults with past-year NSSI reported higher anger at self and others than peers without NSSI. Among those who self-injured, higher-than-usual anger at self, but not at others, predicted greater NSSI thought intensity and lower self-efficacy to resist NSSI 90 minutes later. Anger at self also predicted NSSI behavior, but this association became non-significant when controlling for NSSI thoughts. These findings highlight differences in the object of anger between individuals with and without past-year NSSI and underscore the clinical importance of interventions focused on improving emotion regulation and reducing self-directed anger to decrease NSSI thoughts and prevent self-injury.",Psychology
1049,,"People often intend to embrace a healthy lifestyle but struggle to adopt or maintain these habits. Conflict and facilitation between health goals and other life goals (horizontal interrelations) or personal values (vertical interrelations) can impact the initiation and maintenance of health behaviors. Optimal measures of such goal interrelations are crucial to ensure the efficacy of health behavior interventions. However, existing methods heavily rely on self-reports, making them susceptible to biases. In this study, we introduce the PEP-Goal, the first implicit measure of health goal conflict and facilitation based on the Propositional Evaluation Paradigm (PEP). Our findings revealed notable dissociations between the PEP-Goal and the standard self-report approach (Personal Project Analysis). While our study offers initial support for the predictive validity of PEP-Goal, further refinements are warranted. Specifically, implicit PEP-Goal scores indicating horizontal conflict and facilitation between physical activity (PA) goals and other life goals positively correlated with actual PA behavior, as quantified by activity trackers over a one-week period. Conversely, implicit vertical scores did not exhibit significant predictive value. Although further improvements are necessary, this study provides preliminary evidence for the predictive validity at the horizontal level and practical applicability of PEP-Goal as an implicit measure of goal interrelations.",Psychology
1050,,"Studies of perceptual decision-making typically present the same stimulus repeatedly over the course of an experimental session but ignore the order of these observations, assuming unrealistic stability of decision strategies over trials. However, even so-called ‘stable’, ‘steady-state’ or ‘expert’ decision-making behavior features significant trial-to-trial variability that is richly structured in time. Structured trial-to-trial variability of different forms can be uncovered using latent variable models such as hidden Markov models and autoregressive models, revealing how unobservable internal states change over time. Capturing such temporal structure can avoid confounds in cognitive models, provide insights into inter- and intra-individual variability, and bridge the gap between neural and cognitive mechanisms of variability in perceptual decision-making.",Psychology

Furthermore, differences in school burnout levels associated with profile membership were investigated. A latent profile analysis was conducted to identify subgroups of students with different patterns of math anxiety, enjoyment, boredom and performance (i.e., arithmetic fluency and number processing), followed by latent transition analysis to examine profiles’ stability. We identified four profiles of math emotions and performance: Positive (positive with mixed performance, i.e., high in arithmetic fluency, average in number processing) [t1 and t2: 27.0%]; Anxious (mildly anxious and weaker-performing) [t1: 32.8%; t2: 32.5%]; Neutral (neutral and high-performing) [t1: 25.2%; t2: 25.8%]; and Negative (negative with mixed performance, i.e., weaker in arithmetic fluency, average in number processing) [t1: 15.1%; t2: 14.8%]. The profiles demonstrated high stability of remaining in the same group, with the Anxious profile indicating the highest stability (96.8%) and the Negative profile, the lowest (79.0%). Furthermore, we observed that the profiles characterised by higher performance, higher positive emotions and lower negative emotions exhibited lower burnout levels than other profiles. In line with previous research, these findings suggest that students demonstrate individual differences in math emotions, performance and school burnout already in primary school, and that studying these heterogeneous patterns is crucial for providing personalised educational support in math teaching and learning.",Psychology
1053,,"Objective: The therapeutic alliance is one of the most stable predictors of symptom burden over the course of therapy. So far, this effect has only been examined on the basis of sessions. Continuous-time models (CTM) allow this relationship to be modeled as a continuous process in which the actual time interval between measurements is considered. The aim of the present study was to compare the fit of discrete-time models (DTM) of the alliance-symptom relationship with CTM using different time variables (sessions vs. actual time interval). Method: Data from 1413 patients at a university psychotherapy outpatient clinic were analyzed. The alliance and symptom burden were assessed each session with the Bernese Session Report and the Hopkins Symptom Checklist-Short Form, respectively. Different DTM and CTM were estimated using the R-package ctsem and compared in their fit via the Akaike information criterion. Results: CTMs with session as the time unit fitted the data best. Significant negative within-person effects of alliance and symptom burden were found. These effects showed a significant positive correlation, implying that individuals with a stronger effect of the alliance on symptom severity also showed a stronger effect of symptom severity on the alliance. Conclusions: When modeling the relationship of symptom severity and alliance it seems to be of more importance to capture the fact that a session occurred than to capture the exact time intervals between sessions. Future studies should examine this finding for other psychotherapeutic factors. Interpersonal factors might explain the positive association of the reciprocal alliance-symptom effects.",Psychology
1054,,"Conversation topics may vary in abstractness. This might impact the effort required by speakers to reach a common ground and, ultimately, an interactive alignment. In fact, people typically feel less confident with abstract concepts and single-words rating studies suggest abstract concepts are more associated with social interactions than concrete concepts—hence suggesting increasing levels of abstractness enhance inner and mutual monitoring processes. However, experimental studies addressing conversational dynamics afforded by abstract concepts are still sparse. In three preregistered experiments we ask whether abstract sentences are associated with specific constructs in dialogue, i.e., higher uncertainty, more curiosity and willingness to continue a conversation, and more questions related to causal and agency aspects. We do so by asking participants to evaluate the plausibility of linguistic exchanges referring to concrete and abstract concepts. Results support theories proposing that abstract concepts involve more inner monitoring and social dynamics compared to concrete concepts and suggest that reaching alignment in dialogue is more effortful with abstract than with concrete concepts.",Psychology
1055,,"Although affect and well-being occupy a central place in educational discourse, resources and evidence are still scarce. This study sought to analyse the psychometric properties of brief instruments, identify affective profiles and explore the emotions that students associate with their institution.

Factor, reliability and correlation analyses suggest the validity of both scales; cluster analysis suggests the existence of four affective profiles similar to Norlander et al.'s (2002) model: self-fulfilling, self-destructive, high-affective and low-affective. Although the educational institution is predominantly associated with unpleasant experiences (such as stress, tiredness, sadness and anxiety), it is also associated with joy and happiness; differences were identified depending on the affective profile: for example, associations with interest, motivation and curiosity are distinctive of the self-fulfilling profile, while disappointment, displeasure and loneliness are distinctive of the self-destructive profile. The results suggest that the conjunction of scales and text analysis allows for insights into well-being in educational contexts.",Psychology
1056,,"Lee and Chung explore how ChatGPT augments human creativity in brainstorming. In a series of experiments, they randomized participants to complete a range of creative challenges, either with or without the help of ChatGPT. These challenges included tasks such as coming up with gift ideas, designing toys from various everyday objects, and repurposing household items. Each participant submitted one idea, which external evaluators rated on multiple creativity dimensions, including innovativeness and usefulness. Across tasks, instructing participants to use ChatGPT enhanced the average creativity of ideas, outperforming web searches and unaided human intuition, with creativity measured as the average of aggregated scores of originality (original, innovative, creative) and appropriateness (practical, effective, useful). These results strengthen the empirical evidence for the effectiveness of LLMs in idea generation, contributing to a rapidly growing literature. However, as we further demonstrate analytically, reliance on ChatGPT for idea generation comes with a significant tradeoff: while enhancing individual ideas' creativity, it reduces the diversity of ideas in a pool of ideas—a critical element for effective brainstorming.",Psychology
1057,,"In this chapter, we will summarize recent empirical results highlighting how different groups of people solve pure coordination games. Such games are traditionally studied in behavioural economics, where two people need to coordinate without communicating with each other. Our results suggest that coordination choices vary across groups of people, and that people can adapt flexibly to these differences in order to coordinate between groups. We propose that pure coordination games are a useful empirical platform for studying aspects of mindshaping. Drawing on existing psychological literature on alignment during interactions, we suggest that experience of successful interaction leads people to develop aligned intuitions about what is relevant and appropriate that support coordination when interaction and communication is not possible. Consistent with arguments made in the literature on mindshaping we believe that such alignment is more important for coordination than mindreading inferences about mental states, and indeed that mindreading is instead a form of coordination behaviour that is dependent upon intuitive alignment.",Psychology
1058,,"Four illusions suggest that many 3D visual processes are cognitive rather than perceptual: 

1. LINTON STEREO ILLUSION: A back circle (at 50cm) and a front circle (at 40cm) appear to move rigidly together in depth (whilst their angular size is fixed) when their separation is kept constant in retinal disparity (moving to 40cm and 33cm) rather than physically constant (40cm and 30cm). This suggests that perceived stereo depth reflects retinal disparities, and depth constancy is cognitive rather than perceptual. 

2. LINTON SCALE ILLUSION: Increasing interpupillary distance using a telestereoscope makes scenes seem miniature. We develop a VR telestereoscope that decouples increases of vergence and vertical disparities from increases in horizontal disparities. When horizontal disparities are increased, but vergence and vertical disparity are normal, the scene looks miniature. When vergence and vertical disparity are increased, but horizontal disparities are normal, the scene looks normal. This suggests that visual scale relies on a cognitive association between accentuated stereo shape and closer distances. 

3. LINTON UN-HOLLOW FACE and LINTON MORPHING FACE ILLUSIONS: Using VR, we argue perceived depth is not inverted in the Hollow-Face illusion: First, objects placed in the hollow of the Hollow-Face illusion can be seen veridically in depth against the Hollow-Face illusion. Second, if we put points on the tip and base of the nose, and gradually switch the position of the two eyes (morphing from hollow to protruding), the change in relative depth between these points is seen veridically. This suggests that depth cue integration is cognitive rather than perceptual. 

4. LINTON SIZE CONSTANCY and LINTON SHAPE CONSTANCY ILLUSIONS: Placing a solid rectangular frame around instances of pictorial size constancy, stereo size constancy, and stereo shape constancy all demonstrate that these constancies can be experienced without affecting perceived angular size, suggesting that these constancies are cognitive rather than perceptual.",Psychology
1059,,"Objectives. This study aims to investigate historical trends in the incidence of anorexia nervosa in the U.S. and evaluate the alignment between actual rates and public and professional perceptions. Methods. We analyzed anorexia incidence rates using data from studies retrieved through scientific databases, including Google Scholar, PsycINFO, and Medline/PubMed. Incidence rates were calculated per 100,000 individuals. Additionally, we surveyed 264 U.S. adults and 23 mental health practitioners to capture their estimates of anorexia prevalence over time. Results. Historical data from 1942 to 2010 revealed a stable incidence rate of anorexia nervosa in one U.S. state until 1979, followed by an increase in nationally representative samples beginning in 1990. A slight decline in rates has been observed since then. Survey results indicated that both the general public and practitioners consistently overestimate anorexia prevalence, with the gap widening in more recent years. Notably, public estimates were less accurate compared to those of practitioners, though both groups significantly inflated prevalence rates. Conclusions. There is a persistent overestimation of anorexia nervosa prevalence among both the general public and mental health professionals, with professionals demonstrating slightly greater accuracy. These findings highlight the need for improved awareness and dissemination of accurate epidemiological data to mitigate misconceptions about the disorder's prevalence.",Psychology
1060,,"We present two new versions of the Hollow Face Illusion that challenge our understanding of depth cue integration. Traditional accounts of depth cue integration operate at the level of visual experience. On this account, perspective or shading can cancel out (or even invert) perceived stereo depth. By contrast, Linton (2017), Ch.2, argues that depth cue integration is merely ‘cognitive’, leaving our visual experience of stereo depth intact. The strongest challenge to Linton’s account is the ‘Hollow Face Illusion’, where shape from shading appears to invert stereo depth. Here, we argue that perceived depth is not inverted in the ‘Hollow Face Illusion’. 1. Un-Hollow Face Illusion: The hollow of the ‘Hollow Face Illusion’ is space that physically exists (mask is concave), and yet is impossible so far as the illusion is concerned (illusion is convex). When we fill this concave hollow space with 3D objects (balls, rods, protruding nose) that are inconsistent with the illusion, we experience the illusory motion (which persists) as occurring on a concave surface behind the 3D objects. (Some experience this concavity without the additional objects). 2. Morphing Face Illusion: If we attach small balls to the tip of the nose, base of the nose, and cheek, and morph from a protruding face to a hollow face and back again, the ordinal depth between these three points is seen as switching veridically. Our explanation for the ‘Hollow Face Illusion’ is therefore ‘cognitive’: whilst we might be fooled by the ‘Hollow Face Illusion’, our visual system is not.",Psychology
1061,,"We present a new illusion that challenges our understanding of visual scale. Since Helmholtz’s ‘telestereoscope’ (1857), we’ve known that stereo vision governs visual scale, turning a real-world scene into a miniature scene despite all other depth cues being present. This effect is attributed to vergence and/or vertical disparities (Howard &amp; Rogers, 2012). By contrast, Linton (2018) BioRxiv, attributes the effect to horizontal disparities. To adjudicate between these two accounts, we build a virtual reality ‘telestereoscope’ that can decouple changes in vergence and vertical disparity from changes in horizontal disparity. First, when horizontal disparity is ramped-up, but vergence and vertical disparity are normal, the scene looks miniature. This is an astounding effect, given all other distance cues indicate a normal scene. Second, when vergence and vertical disparity are ramped-up, but horizontal disparity is normal, the scene looks normal, challenging the role that vergence and vertical disparity play in visual scale. Third, ramping-up horizontal disparity also changes the slope of the ground-plane. Fourth, keeping vergence and vertical disparity fixed whilst ramping-up horizontal disparity creates a startling illusion. We judge the scene as a whole to reduce in scale, even though all that changes in our visual experience is a distortion of 3D shape (of the scene and its objects). The illusion changes our concept of ‘visual scale’ from being something that we directly perceive (vision having a range-finder, like vergence or vertical disparity) to something we merely cognitively infer on the basis of an association between accentuated 3D shape and closer distances.",Psychology

1063,,"A prospective partner’s sexual history provides important information that can be used to minimise mating-related risks. Such information includes the number of past sexual partners, which has an inverse relationship with positive suitor evaluation. However, sexual encounters with new partners vary in frequency over time, providing an additional dimension of context not previously considered. Across three studies (N = 5,331) with 15 samples, we demonstrate that the impact of past partner number on a suitor’s desirability varies as a function of distribution over time. Using graphical representations of a suitor’s sexual history, we found that past partner number effects were smaller when the frequency of new sexual encounters decreased over time. This moderation effect was stronger, and often curvilinear, when past partner numbers were higher. We replicated these findings in 11 countries from five world regions. Sex differences were minimal and inconsistent pointing to a lack of a sexual double standards. Sociosexuality (openness to casual sex) was a consistent moderator and tended to mute the sexual history effects. These findings suggest that people not only attend to a potential mate’s quantity of sexual partners, but also the context surrounding these encounters such as pattern and timing. Together, the findings raise the possibility of an evolved mechanism for managing mating risks present in both sexes and across populations and adds nuance to a contentious topic of public interest.",Psychology

1065,,"Cognitive impairments are a core feature of psychotic disorders, but their long-term trajectory remains contentious. Previous meta-analyses were focused on the first 5 years following psychosis onset. Here, we evaluated the change in cognitive impairments in psychotic disorders through a meta-analysis of studies with follow-ups of 5+ years. 
Following pre-registration (PROSPERO, CRD42023447589), databases were searched for relevant articles until July 2024. Two authors screened the reports for studies reporting on the change in cognitive impairments in global cognition, verbal learning and memory, visual learning and memory, working memory, attention, speed of processing, reasoning and problem-solving, and verbal fluency in individuals with psychotic disorders and with a minimum follow-up of 5 years. Three authors extracted data, and the PRISMA guidelines were followed. Random-effects model meta-analyses and moderator analyses were conducted to examine the robustness of the results. 
Twenty-four studies comprising 2633 patients and 1019 controls were included in the study. Over an average of 8.46 years, cognitive impairments remained stable in patients in all 8 measures: global cognition (g = .09; 95% CI, .03-.20), verbal memory (g = .05; 95% CI, -.11, .21), visual memory (g =-.16; 95% CI, -.35, .04), working memory (g =.03; 95% CI, -.09, .14), attention (g =.22; 95% CI, -.36, .80), speed of processing (g =.10; 95% CI, -.14, .35), reasoning and problem-solving (g =.16; 95% CI, -.03, .35), and verbal fluency (g =.08; 95% CI, -.03, .20).

Participants, adolescents from Uruguay (n = 1,208, 59% female, age M = 14.4) and Spain (n = 596, 41% female, age M = 15.7), completed Subjective Well-Being (SWB) scales and wrote about their emotional experiences in an open-ended response. The dictionary showed convergence with other instruments and acceptable inter-rater reliability. When applied to open-ended responses, it captured a substantial proportion of the words written by participants and showed significant correlations with SWB in both the Uruguayan and Spanish samples. These results suggest that quantitative analysis of open-ended responses allows the exploration of well-being, and that this freely available instrument is a valid resource for doing so, serving as a complement to quantitative and qualitative approaches for research or intervention purposes.",Psychology
1067,,"Background. Greater Intolerance of Uncertainty (IU: the tendency to find uncertainty negative) is associated with greater paranoia (mistrust of others) in clinical samples with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders (SSDs). Questions remain on whether the relationship between IU and paranoia / prodromal symptoms is: (1) specific over other related negative affective traits and cognitive biases, and (2) specific to SSDs or is transdiagnostic. 
Method. To examine these research questions, we conducted a survey in those with SSDs (n = 103), anxiety disorders (n = 102) a non-clinical sample (n = 102). Questionnaires included: IU, paranoia, prodromal symptoms of schizophrenia, neuroticism, and jumping to conclusions bias. 
Results. IU, neuroticism, and jumping to conclusion bias was elevated in those with SSDs and anxiety disorders, compared to the non-clinical group. Both paranoia and prodromal symptoms were highest in those with SSDs, then anxiety disorders, and lowest in the non-clinical group. Greater IU was associated with greater paranoia and prodromal symptoms across SSDs, anxiety disorders, and a non-clinical sample. The majority of the relationships between IU and paranoia /prodromal symptoms remained significant when controlling for neuroticism and the jumping to conclusions bias. However, the relationship between IU and paranoia in the SSD group was not specific over the jumping to conclusions bias. 
Conclusions. These findings highlight the potentially transdiagnostic role of IU in paranoia / prodromal symptoms across SSDs and anxiety disorders, which has implications for the development of transdiagnostic treatment interventions for SSDs and anxiety disorders.",Psychology
1068,,"A Student’s Guide to Open Science explores the so-called “replication crisis” in psychology (the inherent difficulties in replicating or reproducing research results to test the robustness of findings) while delving into the ways that open science can address the crisis by transforming research practice.

Students will develop a fundamental understanding of the origins and drivers of the crisis and learn how open science practices can enhance research transparency, replication, and reproducibility.

With a handy, digestible guide for students and researchers alike on how to implement open science practices within their own workflow, as well as pedagogic teaching and learning activities that can be re-used by educators, Pennington’s new book is an essential guide to navigating the replication crisis.

1069,,"Longitudinal study designs present unique challenges for causal reasoning. In this article, we
address the precise definition of a causal estimand as one of these challenges. Using examples
from psychological research, we provide a non-technical introduction to estimands and
illustrate three broader classes of estimands—total, direct, and joint effects—using the
potential outcomes framework and directed acyclic graphs. In longitudinal research, joint
effects play a central role because they extend average treatment effects to repeated
treatments and thus provide a practical measure of cumulative intervention effects over time.
Besides explaining the concept of joint effects and how they relate to mediation, we
discuss their applicability to psychological research. We focus on their interpretation and
whether they can realistically be identified in longitudinal observational studies in
psychology. In this context, addressing unmeasured confounding is a crucial aspect of causal
inference and mediation analyses, yet it is insufficiently discussed in the psychological
literature. To bridge this gap, we propose a class of research designs for psychological studies
where treatment assignment is driven by observable covariates so that joint effects can be
identified under more reasonable assumptions.",Psychology
1070,,"The decision to vaccinate may be motivated by self-protection or community protection, and people may perceive vaccination as mostly a personal responsibility or a collective obligation. We conducted two preregistered survey experiments using a 2-by-2 design with the factors benefit (personal vs. collective) and responsibility (personal vs. collective). The experiments were conducted on large, overlapping representative samples of Norwegian adults: one before (N = 5,474) and one after (N = 1,789) COVID-19 vaccine rollout in Norway. In both experiment the data showed that framing vaccination choice as a collective responsibility (vs. personal responsibility) increased vaccine intentions. Emphasizing personal benefit (vs. collective benefit) increased vaccine intentions in the second experiment, but this effect was not observed in the first experiment. There was no interaction between the factors in either experiment. These findings indicate that highlighting collective responsibility may boost vaccine uptake, but the influence of emphasizing personal versus collective benefits remains inconclusive.",Psychology

Developed through an expert-consensus study, this checklist can be used both to retrospectively evaluate objectivity of completed research and to prospectively guide the design of future experiments.",Psychology
1072,,"Introduction: Our sleep-wake rhythm is determined by the interaction of our work-life balance, i.e. the ‘social clock’, and our biological clock. After retirement, the social restrictions generally loosen up, possibly giving more room for our genetic predispositions to regulate the sleep-wake rhythm. In this study, we investigated shifts in wake-up times and chronotypes during employment and retirement. We hypothesized that the variance of chronotype explained by genetics is larger in retirees compared to employees. 
Method: We used data from 20.189 participants from the Netherlands Twin Register. First, we fitted a regression model to assess the association between chronotype and age. Second, we applied a mixed-effects model to test whether the type of day (working day or non-working day) is a predictor of wake-up time in early birds and late risers. Third, we separated the employed from the retirees and performed a regression to assess the prevalence of chronotypes in the two groups. Fourth, we tested whether the two groups differed in their wake-up times on working days and non-working days using quantile regression. Finally, we used polygenic scores for Morningness to predict the variance in Chronotype in the employed and retirees. 
Results: Chronotype was both linearly and quadratically related to age. Both early and late risers have later wake-up times on non-working days compared to working days. Employment status was not a predictor of chronotype, but rather of wake-up time on working days. The effect of the polygenic score for Morningness on Chronotype did not depend on employment status.  
Discussion: Our study showed that the social clock influences wake-up time on working days, but not chronotype, making chronotype a relatively stable trait. Additionally, the social clock does not suppress the genetic predisposition for chronotype. These analyses enhance our understanding of how both society and genetics influence our chronotype and sleep-wake rhythm.",Psychology
1073,,"Introduction: The introduction of artificial lighting and the 24-hour society provoked a form of circadian misalignment called social jetlag: the misalignment between the biological clock and the social clock. The literature has mainly focused on the association between social jetlag and negative mental health in students, while knowledge on the association with wellbeing in adults is limited.
Methods: The total sample included 20.143 Dutch participants from the Netherlands Twin Register (NTR). The Munich Chronotype Questionnaire was used to compute sleep-corrected social jetlag. Subjective happiness, Satisfaction with life, and Quality of life were used to create a wellbeing factor score. Linear regression models were applied to assess the association between social jetlag and wellbeing, and the interaction effects of age and day of the week. Additionally, a within-family analysis was performed to correct for the effect of the family environment.                                                                                                  
Results: We found a weak but significant negative correlation between social jetlag and the wellbeing scales (r = -0.05). The effect of social jetlag on the wellbeing factor score was marginal (β = -0.05, R2 = 0.22%, p &lt; 0.001, N = 7456) and did not depend on age or day of the week. The within-family design showed that the association was not confounded by effects shared within family such as rearing effects and heritable confounders. 
Discussion: The negative association between social jetlag and wellbeing is marginal, and does not depend on age or day of the week. The association does not seem to be confounded by the effects shared by family members. Our results indicate that social jetlag should not be a primary concern for wellbeing. Future studies should focus on using objective measures for social jetlag and use longitudinal data to disentangle short term and long term results.",Psychology
1074,,"Knowing what someone else knows is important in shared environments. However, the knowledge of others is not immediately perceptible. Luckily, an agent’s behavior within a task leaves clues for an observer to estimate their expertise. A task expert will make the best decisions to reach their goal, while a novice will make decisions seemingly at random. An expert observer should be able to evaluate the decisions of an agent by comparing the agent’s decision to the ideal one. On the other hand, a novice observer does not know the ideal decision and, thus, cannot compare the agent’s decision to it.
We test the hypothesis that with increasing expertise, people can more accurately assess the expertise of others. The results of the two studies we present are consistent with this hypothesis. The first experimental study showed the expected interaction of agent and judge expertise in a task with limited external validity. In the second study, the results of the first study were replicated in a more generally applicable task. We discuss possible moderators of this effect, such as conflicting expertise cues and additional metacognitive information communicated by the agent. Moreover, we outline the consequences of expertise imbalance for identifying imposters in expert fields.",Psychology
1075,,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, children were repeatedly confronted with people wearing facial masks. Little is known, however, about how this affected young children’s interactions with their caregivers. This preregistered experimental within-participants study explored whether facial masks influence young children’s initiation and response to joint attention. Using two structured tasks and one free-play task, we measured joint attention episodes in interactions of 12- to 15-month-old Swiss infants with one of their caregivers during the pandemic. In one experimental condition, the caregivers wore a facial mask; in the other, they did not. The results show no significant differences in infants’ joint attention between the two conditions. Infants may have interacted with their caregivers wearing facial masks enough previously not to be influenced by masks; alternatively, even with a partially covered face, a person provides enough information via eyes and other body parts that help infants to guide their attention.",Psychology
1076,,"Open label placebos (OLPs) refer to the non-deceptive administration of inert treatment. This pre-registered randomised trial (AsPrediced#139837) explored the role of expectations and tailored health feedback on the OLP effect using an automated online procedure. Healthy participants (N=293) were randomised to a 10-day course of OLP pills with veridical feedback (OLP-Feedback: N=92), without feedback (OLP-Standard: N=105), or to a no-treatment control (NTC: N=96). OLP pills were described as enhancing psychological and physical wellbeing. Wellbeing was assessed at baseline, day-5, and day-10. Feedback was delivered on day-5 and day-10 via interactive graphs and descriptive statistics. OLP-treatment significantly improved wellbeing (negative emotions and sleep quality), while feedback did not significantly enhance this effect. Expectations for improvement were significantly elevated among OLP-treated participants across the 10-day study. However, at the individual level, expectations only mediated OLP outcomes once treatment experience had been acquired. Results reconcile inconsistencies in the literature regarding mechanisms.",Psychology
1077,,"Background and aims: Social media vaping awareness campaigns can potentially reduce youth vaping prevalence but creating effective campaign materials is time-consuming and resource-intensive. Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers capabilities for rapidly producing materials at scale, however, little is known about how youth perceive AI-generated multimedia materials combining images and text. This two-phase qualitative study explores whether, and how, AI-generated vaping awareness materials can deter youth vaping.
Methods: In Phase 1, two focus groups with adolescents in Queensland, Australia (n=10 total; mean age:16.3) evaluated 120 AI-generated materials created with an automated-AI framework (zero-shot prompting, single-prompt usage, automatic text-image integration). Participants sorted materials into “effective” or “ineffective” categories and suggested improvements. Using this feedback, 25 new materials were developed through an AI-co-design framework (few-shot prompting, iterative prompting, manual text-image integration). In Phase 2, semi-structured interviews with young adults (n=9, mean age:23) identified effective material characteristics. Both phases used inductive thematic analysis.
Results: Participants in Phase 1 identified limitations in materials developed with an automated-AI framework: misaligned text-image combinations, artificial imagery, unrealistic vaping devices and inauthentic language. Phase 2 revealed six characteristics of effective materials: (1) visual appeal, (2) immediate consequences, (3) relevant to youth, (4) clear calls to action, (5) avoid ambiguity/fearmongering, and (6) tailor to diverse youth. 
Conclusions: AI can generate individual text and image components for health promotion campaigns, but automated-AI multimedia material development is unlikely to succeed. Effective implementation will require co-designing with young people to guide material refinement and design integration.",Psychology

1079,,"Human perception is often characterised by efficient combination of sensory signals (cues). In recent studies, people could also improve precision via newly learned cues, with applications to enhance perception in healthy and clinical groups.  However, it is unclear whether new cues can enhance manual object interactions. To study how new cues are used for object weight perception, people compared weights of containers. With haptic information plus the familiar visual cue of volume, participants showed precision improvements indicating cue combination. By contrast, a group of participants briefly trained with a novel visual cue to weight (line orientation) did not show improvements expected from combination.  We then asked whether prolonged training (12 hours) with the novel cue would promote combination, testing for significant precision gains individually in six participants. Half of participants showed combination benefits, but these were not clearly related to training, as some combined cues before training. Using an illusion analogous to the size-weight illusion, we also asked whether the novel cue would become an automatic predictor of weight: two participants were susceptible to the illusion. We conclude that weight perception is susceptible to some enhancement, but subject to training effects and individual differences that are not yet understood.",Psychology
1080,,"Affective empathy, the ability to share and understand others’ emotional states, is a fundamental aspect of social cognition. Recent evidence suggests that interoceptive inference, the brain’s prediction and processing of internal bodily signals, plays a key role in affective empathy. Building on the active inference framework, we propose that emotional contagion arises from shared interoceptive priors between individuals, shaped by physiological synchrony during social interaction. We hypothesize that precision-weighted interoceptive prediction errors update shared priors, enabling the dynamic alignment of affective states and flexible switching between defensive and affiliative modes of co-regulation. We discuss the putative neurobiological implementation of this model, focusing on the insula, amygdala, and brainstem nuclei involved in interoception and allostatic control. This theoretical account bridges neurobiology and phenomenology through computational modeling, generating precise hypotheses for future research on the mechanisms of emotional contagion",Psychology
1081,,"Depression rates surge during adolescence. Early identification of youth at increased risk for depression is crucial for timely intervention and, ideally, prevention. This study aims to improve the prediction of future depressive symptoms in adolescents by using a multimodal approach that integrates relevant clinical, demographic, behavioral, and neural characteristics. 103 adolescents (ages 12-18; 72.8% female) underwent a baseline assessment including self-report questionnaires, ecological momentary assessment, a clinical interview, and behavioral and neural measures of reward responsiveness. We used nested cross-validation to compare machine learning approaches as well as conventional linear regression in predicting depressive symptoms (Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale [CES-D] and the Mood and Feelings Questionnaire [MFQ]) at a 3-month follow-up. For the prediction of CES-D depression scores, the best performing model was a multivariable linear regression using as predictors five principal component scores from a principal component analysis of baseline variables (RMSE = 5.951, R2 = 0.739). For the MFQ, the best performing model was a simple univariable linear regression with baseline MFQ scores as the sole predictor (RMSE=8.054, R2=0.671). A factors analysis revealed that items assessing melancholic features were most predictive of future depressive symptoms. More complex machine learning approaches did not outperform regression in predicting future depression. The integration of relevant multimodal predictors reveals which adolescent characteristics (e.g., melancholic features and physical anxiety) might have a larger contribution to predicting short-term future depression. Future studies are needed with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up periods to provide a more comprehensive test of such models.",Psychology
1082,,"Modifiable risk factors account for nearly half of dementia cases, with the greatest impact on dementia prevention in midlife (ages 45-64). Little is known about what motivates middle-aged adults to engage in healthy behaviors for dementia risk reduction. This study examined associations between motivation to make lifestyle changes for dementia risk reduction and engagement in health behaviors associated with dementia risk in 347 middle-aged adults. Multivariate linear regressions examined associations between motivation and engagement in health behaviors. Greater self-efficacy and higher education significantly predicted greater physical and cognitive activity and better sleep quality. Greater perceived barriers and general health motivation, lower self-efficacy, and younger age significantly predicted greater perceived loneliness. Self-efficacy consistently predicted engagement in healthy behaviors associated with dementia risk reduction in midlife. Thus, incorporating empirically supported strategies to increase self-efficacy in lifestyle interventions for dementia prevention may increase long-term adherence and overall success of dementia prevention efforts.",Psychology
1083,,"Objectives: Elevated thresholds in the extended high frequency hearing range have been associated with functional hearing deficits, such as speech-in-noise performance. However, unlike the standard frequency range, there are a lack of recommendations from organizations such as the International Standards Organization (ISO) and World Health Organization (WHO) regarding normative data in the extended high frequencies limiting clinical implications of this data. In the present study, we report proposed normative data in the extended high frequency region in over 726 participants evaluated on typical clinical equipment using methodology from both the ISO and WHO. We hypothesize that extended high frequency will worsen with age and show excellent test-retest reliability.  
Design: Audiometric thresholds were collected from 726 adult participants at all measurable frequencies between .25 and 16 kHz. Data were analyzed using the equations reported by the 2017 ISO 7029 report and by calculating a 4-frequency extended high frequency pure tone average in alignment with the WHO. 
Results: Males had worse hearing than females when analyzed using a 4-frequency PTA, but there was no significant difference in the age-related rate of decline. Extended high frequency thresholds (N = 129) showed excellent test-retest reliability (ICC &gt; 0.9, p &lt; 0.001). Extended high frequency 4-frequency PTAs in participants with normal hearing in the standard frequency range had a range of -11.25 to 92.5 dB.
Conclusions: Adaptation of norms in the extended high frequency range is feasible due to agreement among the literature and stability of test-retest measurements. Male extended high frequency thresholds are worse than women, but the rate at which hearing declines does not differ between sexes. Future research in this area should take into account normative data and functional hearing performance.",Psychology
1084,,"Background: Abnormalities in emotion dynamics and processes, such as emotional inflexibility and dominance of negative emotions, are characteristic of depression. The extent to which these abnormalities persist following depressive episodes, and represent a vulnerability factor for recurrent depressive episodes, remains unknown. The current study investigated emotion dynamics and their predictive validity in a sample of individuals with remitted depression (rMDD) and healthy controls (HC). 
Methods: Adults (HC: n=50; rMDD: n=48) completed a three-week ecological momentary assessment protocol, in which they responded to two items probing positive emotions and three items probing negative emotions six times daily. Contemporaneous and temporal networks were constructed using multilevel vector autoregressive models. Density was calculated as a measure of emotional inflexibility and In- and Out-Expected Influence were calculated as measures of centrality. Linear regression models were used to examine if density predicted clinical outcomes at the 6-month follow-up assessment. 
Results: Individuals with rMDD had significantly denser temporal emotional networks than HC participants. Groups also showed differential patterns of the most influential nodes in temporal and contemporaneous networks. Greater temporal density and contemporaneous density was significantly associated with increased depressive symptoms at the 6-month follow-up, assessed through both clinician-rated and self-report measures. 
Conclusions: Abnormalities in emotion dynamics persist following remission from depression and can be used to predict future depressive symptoms, suggesting these may represent a vulnerability factor for depression. Future research should study if interventions based on emotion networks targeting maladaptive emotional processes are able to prevent future depression.",Psychology

However, evidence shows that autistic pupils are more likely to experience lower quality of school life, and an academic attainment gap exists between autistic pupils and their peers. To reduce current educational inequalities for autistic pupils, it is critical to take a holistic approach and understand potential barriers and facilitators to their school success. Amplifying the autistic voice and utilising insights from autistic pupils currently attending mainstream secondary schools alongside their parents, is fundamentally important. This mixed-method, multi-informant study utilised accessible approaches (accessible interviewing, pot-sorting task, parent questionnaire) to explore the views of autistic adolescents (n=14; 12-17 years) and parents. Reflexive Thematic Analysis identified core themes around facilitators and barriers to school success. The young people and parents highlighted core roles of relationships with others, the school environment, individual experiences, and (lack of) understanding. At a time when the UK is experiencing a school and attendance crisis, when school resources are limited, and when so many young people express that they are not happy at school, these insights provide potential areas for the prioritisation of evidence-informed actions, with the ultimate goal of improving school success for autistic pupils.",Psychology

The analysis revealed comments oriented to these videos as performances in need of authentication, which depended on the lifestyle the creators followed off-camera. Authenticity was interactively negotiated, challenged and co-constructed revealing an underlying diet culture discourse.

1087,,"Mediation analysis allows empirical researchers to study how an exposure variable affects an outcome variable through one or more intervening variables. Over the years, mediation analysis has become one of the most widely used statistical techniques in the social, behavioral, and medical sciences. Yet the most popular techniques for mediation analysis rely strongly on normality assumptions and are therefore susceptible to the influence of outliers or nonnormal distributions. We review common mediation models and discuss various approaches for estimation and inference, including their implementation in software packages. Moreover, we present robust alternatives, thereby clarifying different notions of robustness. Finally, we consider a setting where the mediation model holds in a latent space but where measurement issues create deviations from normality assumptions in the observed variable space, which is a setting not commonly considered in the literature on robust mediation analysis, and we obtain preliminary results via a simulation study.",Psychology
1088,,"Sensitivity to environmental influences varies among individuals, with some more responsive to both negative and positive experiences. Individual differences in sensitivity are linked to psychological, physiological, and genetic factors and can be measured using the Highly Sensitive Person (HSP) scale. Over three decades, the conceptualization of sensitivity has shifted from a unidimensional to a multidimensional trait, necessitating a revision of the original scale. This study introduces and validates the revised HSP scale (HSP-R) using a UK and USA sample of 1,000 adults. Exploratory factor analysis on a calibration subsample (n = 600) yielded a 6-factor, 18-item structure, which was confirmed in a validation subsample (n = 400). The HSP-R measures six dimensions of sensitivity: Sensitivity to Details, Depth of Processing, Social Sensitivity, Sensitivity to Positive Experiences, Emotional Reactivity, and Overstimulation. It demonstrates robust psychometric properties, aligns with theoretical frameworks, and provides incremental validity beyond the Big Five traits.",Psychology

1090,,"Efficiency principles are increasingly called upon to study features of human language and communication. Zipf’s law of abbreviation is widely seen as a classic instance of a linguistic pattern brought about by language users’ search for efficient communication. The “law”—a recurrent correlation between the frequency of words and their brevity—is a near-universal principle of communication, having been found in all of the hundreds of human languages where it has been tested, and a few non-human communication systems as well. The standard explanation for the law of abbreviation derives it from pressures for efficiency: speakers minimize their cumulative effort by using shorter words for frequent occurrences. This explanation, we argue here, fails to explain why long words exist at all. It also fails to explain why the law of abbreviation, despite being robust, is systematically weakened by many short and rare words. We propose an alternative account of the law of abbreviation, based on a simple cultural evolutionary model. Our model does not require any pressure for efficiency. Instead, it derives the law of abbreviation from a general pressure for brevity applying to all words regardless of their frequency. This model makes two accurate predictions that the standard model misses: the correlation between frequency and brevity is consistently weak, and it is characterized by heteroskedasticity, with many short and rare words. We argue on this basis that efficiency considerations are neither necessary nor sufficient to explain the law.",Psychology
1091,,"Evidence accumulation modelling has been shown to uncover new insights into the cognitive mechanisms that underlie decision making from behavioural data. By jointly modelling reaction time and accuracy data, such decision models estimate latent variables that represent distinct computaitonal processes, such as stimulus encoding, response caution and the quality of information processing. In this study we use an evidence accumulation model, the Linear Ballistic Accumulator (LBA), to shed new light into the mechanisms that underlie learning based on linguistic and action-based training. The LBA model is applied to behavioural data from a previously published training study where participants learn to name, tie or name and tie a set of knots. Our results show that training is multifaceted and associated with an increase in stimulus-encoding time, a reduction in response caution, as well as an increase in the speed of information accumulation. Furthermore, the results showed that there was an added benefit to the rate of evidence accumulation when naming and tying experience were combined. This latter finding suggests that performance benefits from multi-modal training may be instantiated in computational processes that are associated with the quantity and quality of information accumulation during decision making. Overall, in applying this computational approach to accuracy and reaction time data, we uncover new insights into the mechanisms that govern experience-dependent plasticity.",Psychology
1092,,"Between April and October 2024, expert bodies in two countries reached strikingly opposite conclusions about the therapeutic use of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA). On the one hand, the Food and Drug Administration in the USA rejected a formal New Drug Application from a specific drug sponsor, Lykos Therapeutics, for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The decision was surprising to many, given the FDA granting it “breakthrough therapy status” a few years before. Across the Atlantic, the Dutch State Commission on MDMA recommended the same treatment to be made available as soon as possible for PTSD and also investigated for other conditions. 
Apart from important differences regarding the legal mandate of these two expert bodies, some important epistemic differences are notable in these two distinct approaches to assess the evidence. These cases serve as examples of the current challenges to develop and implement evidence-based psychedelic therapies given the limitations of the prevailing influential framework of Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM), which seems to have particularly influenced the FDA’s decision. On the other hand, the Dutch approach more closely resembles the recent EBM+ approach. Drawing from historically tragic fatal examples, as well as recent advances in evidence assessment, such as masking and mask mandates during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is argued that a shift to EBM+ is paramount to allow reliable assessments towards evidence-based implementation of psychedelics as therapeutic tools.",Psychology
1093,,"Color-coded forest plots are a common feature in experimentation dashboards in industry, designed to facilitate quick interpretation of complex datasets. These visualizations are intended to provide companies the ability to make rigorous, data-driven decisions. This paper presents a series of studies that explore how users—ranging from university students with formal statistics training to experienced industry professionals—interpret and make decisions based on these visualizations. Our findings reveal that despite their intended purpose, color-coded forest plots can lead to systematic misinterpretation, with users frequently ignoring the precision of estimates and making decisions based primarily on the presence of statistical significance. Through a combination of empirical studies and simulation, we demonstrate that this approach to decision-making influenced by these visualizations not only introduces biases but also results in suboptimal outcomes compared to more rigorous statistical strategies. These insights highlight the need for re-evaluating the design and use of such visualizations in professional settings.",Psychology
1094,,"In recent years, social media has become increasingly fragmented, as platforms evolve and new alternatives emerge. Yet most research studies a single platform—typically Twitter/X, or occasionally Facebook—leaving little known about the broader social media landscape. Here we shed new light on patterns of cross-platform variation in the high-stakes context of news sharing. We examine the relationship between user engagement and news domains’ political orientation and quality across seven platforms: Twitter/X, BlueSky, TruthSocial, Gab, GETTR, Mastodon, and LinkedIn. Using an exhaustive sampling strategy, we analyze all (over 10 million) posts containing links to news domains shared on these platforms during January 2024. We find that the news shared on platforms with more conservative user bases is significantly lower quality on average. Turning to patterns of engagement, we find—contrary to hypotheses of a consistent “right wing advantage” on social media—that the relationship between political lean and engagement is strongly heterogeneous across platforms. Conservative new posts receive more engagement on platforms where most content is conservative, and vice versa for liberal news posts,  consistent with an “echo platform” perspective. In contrast, the relationship between news quality and engagement is strikingly consistent: across all platforms examined, lower-quality news posts received higher average engagement even though higher quality news is substantially more prevalent and garners far more total engagement across posts. This pattern holds despite accounting for poster-level variation, and is observed even in the absence of ranking algorithms, suggesting user preferences – not algorithmic – bias may underlie the underperformance of higher-quality news.",Psychology

Putin formulated the aims of his military operation: to protect Russian-speakers from “genocide”, to disarm and denazify Ukraine. Apparently, this idea is delusional. Certain war instigators are paranoid in their tendency to present themselves as prophets or world saviors. Some of them are aggressive against delusional goals. Mentally healthy people can be susceptible to psychotic appeals, a predisposing condition being fear of strangers and projection of hatred upon them. Some individuals, maltreated during their childhood, respond by acting out fight or flight responses, attacking weaker persons and submitting to dominant ones. This seems to be reflected by Putin’s relationships with Ramzan Kadyrov, the head of Chechen Republic, who appears as a dominant personality. Certain ethnically non-Russian subjects of the Federation may be interested in a continuation of the Ukraine war; and there are concerns that Putin has come under their influence. An important topic in this connection is the inter-ethnic difference in the birth rate and migrations, which is avoided by Russian media and officials these days. In conclusion, mental derangements in politicians are dangerous and must be diagnosed by psychiatrists on the basis of speech, writings, and behavior. More expert opinions are needed.",Psychology
1096,,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is commonly treated with pharmacological or physical therapies, which are often associated with side effects. Combining motor imagery (MI) with neurofeedback (NFB) offers a potential complementary non-pharmacological therapy. The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)-guided NFB protocol that integrates MI of whole-body movements with changes in deoxygenated hemoglobin concentration (d[HbR]) to alleviate motor symptoms of PD.

Three groups (N = 19 each) completed four training sessions. The NFB group, consisting of healthy older adults, and the PD-NFB group performed MI tasks with NFB based on supplementary motor area (SMA) activity, while the noNFB group of healthy older adults performed MI without NFB.

Participants in the NFB groups generally reported positive perceptions of NFB controllability. The NFB group showed a significant increase in SMA activation compared to the noNFB group and, in part, for baseline MI compared to NFB MI. No significant differences were found between the NFB and PD-NFB groups. There was no significant difference between NFB training and baseline MI in the PD group.

This study is the first to investigate fNIRS-guided NFB combining MI with d[HbR] to enhance SMA activation. The results suggest potential of the studied protocol for motor neurorehabilitation, but simultaneously highlight the need for further refinement and research.",Psychology
1097,,"Electroencephalography (EEG) is one of the main neuroscientific measures used with infants and children to identify potential biomarkers of cognitive and social developmental processes. Given the implications of developmental EEG research within policy, clinical, and educational domains, it is important to ensure that reported results are generalizable and reproducible. In this review, to provide an initial assessment of previous and current practices regarding participant recruitment and demographic reporting, we carried out a systematic review of the six journals publishing the most pediatric EEG studies between 2011-2023. We identified 700 articles reporting on pediatric EEG (N &gt; 80,000). We find that most studies did not provide complete reporting of basic demographic information (e.g., race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, geographical location). This trend persisted across years of publication, suggesting continued underreporting. However, the reporting of demographic information differed between journals, suggesting solutions for improving reporting practices. Our review also indicated that samples consisted of mostly White participants (78%) from North America and Western Europe (85%). Moreover, the median total sample size was 51 participants. Our discussion emphasizes the need for larger, more diverse samples and greater transparency in developmental EEG studies, while providing recommendations to address barriers to representation and reproducibility.",Psychology
1098,,"Individuals make automatic aesthetic judgements potentially supporting an approach or avoidance posture towards everyday objects. The current study uses a novel evolutionary approach to explore which features of a complex flower-like stimulus reliably emerge as appealing, easy to view, disgusting and threatening. Across three experiments the procedure used approximately 20 parameters that became more or less likely to appear within the stimuli as participants selected the most and least appealing, easy to view, disgusting or threatening flowers from a selection of six flowers per trial. Most important to appeal was a high number of outer petals (ray florets) and symmetrical arrangement of outer petals. This was also found to be important to ease of viewing, consistent with the fluency processing theory of aesthetic appeal. The presence of binarized fractals was found to be important to the perception threat and disgust. This was unexpected but potentially mimics patterning on animals such as a saturated red against a black body. The novel evolutionary method developed for establishing the features important to a perceptual judgment shows potential for use with complex and high feature space stimuli.",Psychology
1099,,"Currently, no clinically relevant physiological markers of post-COVID exist, which stymies treatment development and rehabilitation efforts. Therefore, a monocentric cross-sectional study was conducted to characterize the long-term mental and physical health consequences of infection with SARS-COV-2. 156 participants were recruited as part of the voluntary post-COVID consultation hours at the BG Hospital Hamburg, Germany, after the insured persons were invited by the relevant statutory accident insurance providers. Overall, 34% of participants were unable to work. Based on German census data, poststratification was used to provide a profile of mental health and physical symptoms recorded in the long-COVID consultations. Although many characteristics were within the normal range, BMI values, limitations in physical role functioning, vitality issues, somatization, phobic anxiety, and psychoticism were borderline or slightly elevated. Furthermore, long-COVID patients with high BMI values, high medication counts, multiple ICD diagnoses, and secondary diagnoses tended to report poorer physical and mental health conditions. We also used a multivariate network approach to provide a comprehensive perspective of relationships between physical and mental health symptoms and identify the most influential symptoms to develop potential intervention routes. Notably, the number of months since the COVID-19 diagnosis was one of the most central elements of the multivariate network. Although people with a less recent COVID diagnosis tended to have more secondary diagnoses, they tended to report fewer sleep-related problems, less stress sensitivity, better physical functioning, and better overall quality of life, indicating that some symptoms may decrease with time. In addition to the number of months since the COVID diagnosis, other central elements of the multivariate network included physical functioning, social role functioning, phobic anxiety, interpersonal sensitivity, and decreased sleep, highlighting potential intervention routes. Overall, our results might be used to design future diagnostic, preventive, and rehabilitation long-COVID measures.",Psychology
1100,,"We are currently seeing a dramatic decline in the mental health of children and young people. To successfully reverse this trend, we greater emphasis on promoting the wellbeing of children and young people. Low mental wellbeing is a significant predictor of future mental ill-health and it is also a distressing and disabling state that requires intervention in its own right. For these reasons we need large scale screening for low mental wellbeing, using validated measures. Encouraging young people to access interventions to boost their mental wellbeing may in fact be easier than encouraging children and young people to access interventions to treat subthreshold mental ill-health. Then we need to link young people into evidence-based interventions that promote mental wellbeing through their school, university, local community or online. This is how we can achieve an effective, low-stigma, approach to targeted prevention (i.e., selective or indicated). At a systems level, we also need to adopt a dual systems approach to mental health that aligns with the dual continua model of mental health. This requires building and then integrating a new mental health promotion system that complements our existing mental healthcare system. The dire state of youth mental health in Australia and globally is an urgent call-to-action for everyone in government, health, community, and family settings to do more to protect those in their care. Making full use of the available evidence and the tools at-hand is a logical first step.",Psychology

Given depressed individuals have difficultly engaging with pleasurable activities, this study aimed to explore the effect of motivational mental imagery on behavioural engagement in non-depressed, dysphoric, and depressed individuals. Participants selected four activities they wished to engage in and rated expected outcomes and anticipated emotions relating to activity completion before and after mental elaboration of each activity using either motivational mental imagery or verbal reasoning. Over the following week, utilising ecological momentary assessment (EMA), participants recorded the frequency with which they engaged in their chosen activities. Results showed both conditions led to similar levels of behavioural engagement, however exploratory analysis found differences in the potential underlying mechanisms, suggesting that whilst both tasks may influence behavioural engagement, the underlying mechanism/s by which behavioural engagement is occurring are different.",Psychology

1104,,"Adults can reflectively revise their beliefs and selectively respond to unreliable informants, despite often forming and revising beliefs unreflectively without assessing their reasons. This study investigates how the strength of counterevidence coming from an informant affects adults’ ability to infer that the informant is unreliable through acquiring and responding to undermining defeaters (i.e., evidence suggesting that something was wrong with how the belief was formed). Participants (N = 120) watched videos of two informants acting on two locations: one whose actions reliably indicated the reward location, and one whose actions did not. The strength of feedback participants received after making a choice was manipulated across two conditions. In the Strong feedback condition, participants received positive feedback when they found the reward and explicit negative feedback when they did not, along with information about the reward's true location. In the Weak feedback condition, they received positive feedback, but incorrect choices simply resulted in no reward appearing. Participants responded selectively to unreliability, following the Unreliable informant’s evidence less often than that of the Reliable informant. This effect was observed after only two to three misleading trials, but only in the Strong feedback condition. In subsequent trials where informants were pitted against each other, participants in the Strong feedback condition, but not in the Weak feedback condition, consistently preferred the Reliable informant. These findings suggest that adults’ ability to infer informants’ reliability depends on the strength of counterevidence. Additionally, exploratory analyses reveal a key distinction between acquiring and responding to undermining defeaters.",Psychology
1105,,"In today’s media landscape, there are an ever-expanding number of communication channels that people can use to communicate within their interpersonal relationships. What social and psychological factors are associated with the selection of communication channels in everyday life? Here we report on findings from an intensive longitudinal field study of undergraduate students (N = 1,423 participants; ecological momentary assessments = 27,644) that examined: (1) the role of interaction partners in the selection of communication channels and (2) the associations between channel selection and perceptions of empathy during meaningful social interactions. Our findings indicated a preference for media-rich channels, such as face-to-face and video communication, particularly when engaging with weak social ties, compared to strong social ties. In addition, the use of media-rich channels was linked to greater momentary perceptions of empathy. Specifically, face-to-face interactions (compared to computer-mediated), as well as video calls and phone calls (compared to direct messaging) were associated with greater perceptions of empathy. These findings support and extend Media Multiplexity Theory, Media Richness Theory, and Media Synchronicity Theory by examining them in the context of interpersonal communication. The findings also show that channel selection is associated with empathy perceptions, which has implications for how people navigate social connections in an increasingly digital environment.",Psychology
1106,,"Inspired by economic theory, theorists in neuroeconomics and related fields contend that value serves as a common currency for selection among options. While impressive support for this view has amassed over the last three decades, critics have raised serious concerns. They argue that there are pathways to action that bypass value, dissimilar psychological systems do not share a common value currency, and the view cannot accommodate well documented kinds of “irrationality”, such as context effects. This essay offers a systematic response. Key refinements are made to the common currency view allowing for a common currency to operate at two phases (decision-phase and learning-phase) and at two levels (options-level and meta-level). These refinements help address the criticisms and yield a more nuanced understanding of the role of value in human decision-making.",Psychology
1107,,"The attentional probe paradigm involves presenting participants with different messages simultaneously through two distinct information channels within the same modality. By measuring reaction times to modality-specific probes that can appear in either channel, this paradigm enables the assessment of attention allocation between these channels. Since the 1980s this paradigm has become prominent for investigating attentional biases in the processing of emotional information. The best-known version of it, the dot-probe technique introduced by MacLeod, Mathews, and Tata (1986), uses the visual modality. What is less well-known is that I had previously introduced the attentional probe paradigm in 1981 in the auditory modality in a modified dichotic listening experiment with pure tones as auditory probes. Using this tone-probe technique this study investigated the contrasting ways in which repressors and sensitisers (Byrne,1961) handle threatening information. Criticisms from a contemporary perspective notwithstanding of the rather limited initial study, it was concluded that sensitisers displayed an attentional bias favouring the processing of threatening stimuli, whereas repressors appeared to avoid the optimal processing of such stimuli.  This paper presents a historical reconstruction of how I developed the attentional probe paradigm, how I first applied it in the auditory modality, and how it was subsequently used in the visual modality. It also introduces a multimodal version to be used in further research and offers a critique of extant research relying exclusively on decontextualized stimuli.",Psychology
1108,,"This study investigated the neurodevelopmental impacts of displacement on resettled Syrian refugee children in Canada, focusing on how the timing and duration of adversity experienced during displacement influence neural network organization. Using graph theoretical approaches within a network neuroscience framework, we examined how the developmental timing of displacement (age of displacement, duration of displacement) related to functional integration, segregation, and small-worldness. Syrian refugee children (n=59, MAge=14 Range = 8-18), completed a resting state scan using functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) neuroimaging. Data were analyzed to assess the link between neural network properties and developmental timing of adversity. Results indicate that prolonged displacement experienced earlier in life was significantly linked with neural network organization, impacting the balance between the brain's functional integration and segregation as quantified by the overall reduced small worldness in comparison to experiencing displacement at an older age. This study leverages the experiences of refugee children to advance our understanding of how the timing of adversity affects development, providing valuable insights into the broader impacts of early adversity on neurodevelopment.",Psychology
1109,,"Adverse childhood experiences are considered a powerful determinant of emotional health. One indicator of emotional health is loneliness, which refers to a distressing experience that one’s social relationships are less in quality and quantity than those desired. This preregistered review aimed to examine the association between adverse childhood experiences (e.g., physical abuse/neglect, emotional abuse/neglect, sexual abuse, parental separation/divorce, family conflict, domestic violence) and loneliness in adulthood. A database search (Embase, Ovid, Cochrane Library, APA PsychINFO, Medline, Pubmed, Scopus) was conducted. After removal of duplicates, 3,689 papers were reviewed and 20 met inclusion criteria. When feasible, results were pooled using a random-effects meta-analysis and inverse variance modelling and reported narratively. Meta-analyses revealed a statistically significant association between cumulative adverse childhood experiences and loneliness (r = 0.30, 95% CI [0.22-0.37]; prediction interval = 0.04-0.52) and between specific adversity types and loneliness, namely sexual abuse, physical abuse, physical neglect, emotional abuse, and emotional neglect. Some heterogeneity was observed across studies. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses revealed no differences in age, gender, age group, continent, or measures of adversity/loneliness. This research indicates that adversities in childhood may have some long-term influences on loneliness, both cumulatively and within adversity subtypes.",Psychology
1110,,"Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly large language models (LLMs), has garnered significant attention for their potential to augment and possibly even replace current forms of psychological assessment or treatment. However, current AI technologies have yet to demonstrate the capacity to effect lasting psychological change. This paper outlines five key criteria for developing effective AI clinical psychology interventions, grounded in clinical science principles and emerging evidence from the AI mental health field: 1) attending to mechanisms of patient change, 2) conducting meaningful evaluation, 3) attending to time and dose, 4) modeling key characteristics of therapists and patients; and 5) attending to engagement and sustainability. Despite their potential, LLMs face notable technical and therapeutic limitations, including memory constraints, failure to guide users through a coherent set of interventions, the tendency to engage in advice-giving over inquiry, and a proclivity to demonstrate rather than teach skills. We provide key technical considerations relevant to each criterion, including using multi-agentic models, using multi-step language programming, and finding more suitable objectives for reinforcement learning. Lastly, we discuss open questions in the field of clinical psychology AI, including whether humans will interact with AI the same way they interact with other humans, how scalability can be balanced with human monitoring, given safety concerns, and how large language models might radically disrupt how psychological interventions are delivered. Only by combining insights from clinical science with a clear understanding of the technical affordances and limitations of large language models will it be possible for AI to make a meaningful impact on human psychological suffering.",Psychology

1113,,"Cognitive optimization remains an open challenge in understanding how individuals can align their goals, routines, and values with their potential for growth and adaptation. The ESTIMAT framework introduces a theoretical model inspired by Fermi estimation to analyze and enhance human decision-making and self-regulation. Grounded in the principles of hierarchical decomposition, information theory, and behavioral adaptation, ESTIMAT aims to bridge abstract concepts of motivation, identity, and cognitive states with measurable, actionable metrics.

The central premise of ESTIMAT is to quantify ""Moments of Peak Motivation"" (MPMs)—states of heightened engagement and alignment—using a States Metric (SM). This metric, rooted in information entropy, evaluates the adaptive potential of individuals across physical, emotional, social, and intellectual dimensions. By breaking complex cognitive states into manageable components, ESTIMAT offers a structured method for designing tasks, routines, and long-term goals that maximize both intrinsic and extrinsic motivations.

This paper outlines the conceptual foundations of ESTIMAT, presents its parallels with Fermi estimation, and discusses potential applications in self-improvement, behavioral sciences, and cognitive engineering. While empirical validation is forthcoming, the framework provides a robust starting point for interdisciplinary exploration and practical application.",Psychology
1114,,"Most prior literature tends to examine potentially traumatic event (PTE) exposure as a cumulative risk, whereby all PTEs are assumed to have equal impact on substance use (SU) or be equally impacted by SU. However, this dubious assumption could be obscuring important differences in the PTE-SU relationship. We operationalize McLaughlin &amp; Sheridan’s (2016) dimensional model of trauma exposure to examine the impact of PTEs types on SU and SU on PTE types concurrently and prospectively. We leverage data from 11,800 community youth (ages 9-15 years old) enrolled in the nationwide, longitudinal Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study. We analyze concurrent and prospective (one year later) associations between PTE types (physical abuse, domestic violence, community violence, emotional neglect, poverty, and institutionalization/deprivation) and substance use (pooling alcohol, cannabis, or nicotine) whereby exposure to different PTE types predicts SU (self-medication), and SU predicts different PTE types (susceptibility). Concurrently, we find emotional neglect was significantly positively related to SU. Prospectively, institutionalization/deprivation, emotional neglect, and physical abuse significantly positively predicted SU and were predicted by SU. A majority of associations between PTE types and SU were accounted for by other PTE types and time-varying covariates (e.g., age, internalizing/externalizing symptoms). Emotional neglect is more likely to lead to SU and be predicted by SU than other PTE types. Findings suggest that surveillance for SU is especially warranted in youth with emotional neglect, relative to other PTEs. Future research should examine more types of PTEs along a wider age span to replicate findings.",Psychology

And yet, it is becoming increasingly necessary to take a stance on this. To support our colleagues in clinical psychology to take a stance on open science practices and to motivate them to apply these practices in their research, we describe here how the use of open science practices benefits or can benefit clinical psychology science and practice and provide some perspective on why we believe that the increasing use of open science practices is consistent with good scientific practice and the ethical standards of our profession. In addition, we discuss how calls for increased implementation of open science practices in psychological research can be reconciled with some of the challenges, concerns, and conflicts that can arise around open science practices, especially in clinical psychology. Finally, we extend open science's inclusive and collaborative stance to include ""experts by experience"" in the research process. Including our research topics in the research process is a specific facet of the open science approach in clinical psychology that has been overlooked.",Psychology

1117,,"In visual search, observers often miss rare targets. This low prevalence effect (LPE) is resistant to many cognitive interventions. However, a recent study showed that having participants identify the item that was most similar to the target (similarity search) eliminated the LPE. As real-world searches often require binary decisions (e.g., is there a threat in this bag?) we tested whether the benefits of similarity search generalize to binary decisions and to more naturalistic stimuli. Participants searched for T shapes amongst near T-distractors and the prevalence of True-T’s was manipulated. In the similarity search only condition, participants clicked on the “most T-like object”. In the similarity search &amp; binary decision condition, participants additionally reported whether the chosen item was a true T (yes/no). We found that in some circumstances, similarity search can be used to attenuate the LPE. However, there was an LPE for the binary decision task. Participants were less likely to classify the target as a true-T during low prevalence compared to high. We replicated this result in an additional experiment using more naturalistic stimuli. Participants watched clips of road videos and clicked on the “most hazardous location” in the video, followed by a binary decision (“would you need to respond to that hazard? yes/no”). Though participants located the hazards regardless of prevalence, there was an LPE for the binary decision task. Together, these results indicate potential limitations in applying similarity search outside the laboratory; the LPE is still seen in these searches if a binary decision is involved.",Psychology
1118,,"Understanding the psychosocial and community risk factors associated with financial exploitation is essential in developing prevention strategies. Although previous work has identified factors related to increased risk such as poor financial literacy, cognitive decline, and worse mental health, less is known about social factors, particularly those tied to our community and how they interact with our ability to form meaningful relationships. To investigate this issue, we used a previously published national sample of U.S. adults aged 20 to 94 (N = 886). We used self-reported zip code data coupled with the US Census data to reconstruct community-level indicators of social cohesion (i.e., neighborhood disorder, neighborhood disadvantage, residential instability). We found that reduced community-level social cohesion was associated with increased risk for financial exploitation. In addition, our exploratory analyses indicated that community-level indicators of social cohesion also moderated the association between subjective cognitive decline and risk of financial exploitation. Specifically, individuals with higher levels of subjective cognitive decline residing in areas with low residential instability appeared to have lower risk of financial exploitation. These results highlight how community-level factors contribute to risk for financial exploitation, which may provide a foundation for future work aimed at improving prevention strategies and public policy.",Psychology
1119,,"Military personnel are often required to make perceptual decisions based on noisy and uncertain information. Over the last decade, work from experiments using simple stimuli in visual psychophysical paradigms has provided evidence that in the visual periphery, observers are often prone to false alarms and variable confidence judgments in detection tasks. To better understand whether these characteristics extend to more naturalistic paradigms, our research group has developed visual detection experiments in virtual reality, where on each trial, observers are required to first fixate on specific objects, and then make judgments about whether a target (i.e., a green soldier in uniform) is present, and rate confidence in this decision. Inevitably, extending the study of peripheral vision to virtual reality involves trade-offs, with tension between the degree of experimental control that is employed and the ecological validity of the task. In this piece, we focus on the challenges that emerged and the lessons we have learned in pursuit of designs that strike a balance between these factors. In our first experiment, we required participants to ride in an automatically-controlled vehicle, fixate on each red stop sign, and determine whether targets were present in the periphery while looking at the stop sign. Results indicated that observers (1) did not successfully fulfill fixation requirements in the task in all trials, and (2) requiring targets to appear and disappear based on whether a fixation requirement was met resulted in flickering that served as an unintentional, salient cue. In our second experiment, we allowed participants to navigate the vehicle themselves, while again requiring the same fixation requirement and perceptual judgments at each intersection. Initial tests of this design found that variability in how participants navigated in the vehicles sometimes resulted in stopping at locations that did not allow for viewing the stop sign and soldier at the same moment. Finally, in our third experiment, we manipulated the presence of the targets on each trial, and expanded our confidence questions to include both target-present and target-absent trials. Results revealed that confidence was similar in both target-present and target-absent conditions. Based on these preliminary findings, we outline design-related recommendations for studies of the periphery, and explain the tradeoffs that extend across several military-relevant tasks, including both target detection and visual search.

1121,,"Child maltreatment (CM) represents a key risk factor for a wide range of maladaptive developmental outcomes. In particular, child abuse and neglect are thought to exert detrimental effects on neurocognitive development, including impairments in executive functions (EF) during childhood. We conducted a preregistered multilevel meta-analysis to examine differential associations between CM dimensions and core EF domains: working memory, inhibitory control, and cognitive flexibility. Based on 59 studies with 13,022 participants, our results indicate a medium-sized association (g = 0.43) between overall CM and EF, although high levels of heterogeneity were observed both within and between studies. While differential outcomes as a function of EF domains may partly explain this heterogeneity, maltreatment dimensions (i.e., abuse vs. neglect) did not account for it. These findings suggest a non-specific association between CM dimensions and EF domains, potentially driven by shared attachment-related characteristics of CM.",Psychology
1122,,"In typing proficiency tests, like those used in job recruitment or research studies, individuals are evaluated based on their speed and accuracy. However, the difficulty of the typed text — its ‘typability’ — can impact typing performance, introducing variability that is unrelated to skill. To ensure valid comparisons across individuals, time, and conditions, it is crucial to control for this variation in text difficulty. To address this issue, we develop the Typability Index, a model that predicts the relative typing speed of text. Building on earlier attempts to quantify typing difficulty from the 1940s, we create a more advanced typability model using the 136M Keystrokes dataset (Dhakal et al., 2018) where over 168,000 participants each typed 15 sentences from a pool of 1,525 items. Through random forest regression, we identify 10 key predictors from 33 candidate variables, including the proportion of lowercase letters, word frequency, and finger movement mechanics. Trained on 80% of the dataset and validated on the remaining 20% and a novel dataset, the Typability Index explained 72-87% of the variance in typability, compared to the 34% explained by an earlier leading model (Bell, 1949). To promote higher control in typing research and assessments, we introduce a web-based tool to facilitate accurate measurement and fair comparisons of text typability.",Psychology
1123,,"Rumination, or thinking passively and repetitively about one’s distress, and low emotional clarity, or not understanding one’s emotions, are risk factors for psychopathology. It has been suggested that people attempt to increase emotional clarity by ruminating, but whether ruminating works to help or harm emotional clarity in the moment is unknown. In N=74 adults, following an idiographic negative mood induction, we experimentally manipulated rumination and two comparison conditions – distraction and mindfulness – to assess their effects on negative emotion, subjective and implicit indices of emotional clarity, and self-insight. Manipulation checks showed that conditions produced a pattern of distinct experiences theoretically consistent with each response style. Compared to comparison conditions, rumination was less effective in alleviating negative emotion. However, all conditions produced similar effects on emotional clarity and self-insight. Whereas each condition failed to influence subjective emotional clarity, they increased implicit clarity and perceived self-insight. Results underscore the importance of incorporating multiple measures of emotional clarity and suggest that, compared to other cognitive emotion response styles, rumination may function as a double-edged sword that keeps one entrenched in negative emotion but without impairing implicit emotional clarity and self-insight. Findings may have implications for why people ruminate despite its negative impact on well-being.",Psychology
1124,,"In the Olympic sport of speed climbing, athletes compete to reach the top of a 15-meter wall as quickly as possible. Since the standardization of the speed climbing route in 2007, improvement has been driven by a process of cumulative cultural evolution—new route sequences innovated by some are copied and improved upon by others. In this study, we use simulation-based inference to fit an agent-based model of speed climbing to 12 years of competitive speed climbing times (2007-2019). By analyzing the dynamics of the fitted model, we are able to gain some insight into the processes that may be driving cumulative improvement in speed climbing. Innovation and copying are used roughly equally by climbers, with copying having only a slight advantage. Slower agents in the model are more likely to innovate, likely in pursuit of strategies that give them a competitive advantage. Population size negatively predicts innovation, presumably because innovation is not as useful when there are plenty of existing solutions to choose from.

However, little research has examined how to support successful study major choice processes. To address this gap, we draw on person-environment fit and (affective) forecasting bias theories, assuming that higher objective major-specific fit forecasts (interests, skills, expectations) predict success (motivation, satisfaction, dropout intention, achievement) beyond subjective forecasts. Additionally relying on expectancy-value theory and cognitive dissonance theory, we assume that higher objective major-specific fit forecasts, when displayed in feedback, predict higher motivation to choose a major and higher likelihood of enrollment beyond subjective forecasts. Finally, we propose that prospective students receiving feedback before enrollment experience more success than those receiving no feedback. We tested these hypotheses in a longitudinal field study. Over three years, more than 4000 prospective students received feedback on their objective major-specific fit forecasts in an online-self-assessment and reported their motivation for the major before and after feedback. Subsequently, over 500 of these prospective students entered their respective major and reported their success. Additionally, we surveyed over 200 students who did not receive feedback. As hypothesized, objective major-specific fit forecasts predicted success beyond subjective forecasts. Higher objective forecasts related to higher motivation to choose the major and higher likelihood of enrollment beyond subjective forecasts. Finally, prospective students who received feedback on their objective forecasts before enrollment experienced more success compared to no feedback. We discuss theoretical implications for study choice and success theories and practical implications for study guidance.",Psychology
1126,,"The confrontation with the catastrophic consequences of the climate crisis can elicit strong emotions in individuals. These so-called climate emotions are an important driver behind pro-environmental behavior. However, they have also been associated with impaired mental health. In the light of the huge challenges we face, understanding the complex mechanisms behind emotions, behavior and mental health is crucial. The Inventory of Climate Emotions (ICE) presents the first validated scale to assess a multitude of different emotional responses (anger, contempt, enthusiasm, powerlessness, guilt, isolation, anxiety and sorrow) to the climate crisis. This pre-registered study aimed to translate and validate the ICE in a representative German sample (N = 966). We replicated the 8-factor structure and all subscales showed acceptable to good internal consistency. Furthermore, we replicate a positive association between multiple climate emotions (powerlessness, guilt, isolation, anxiety, sorrow) with general depressive and anxiety symptoms. We also show that climate emotions are generally positively associated with pro-environmental behavior, the only exception being climate contempt, which was negatively associated with pro-environmental behavior. In conclusion, we present a validated German translation of the ICE and provide evidence for a negative association of climate emotions and mental health as well as a positive association of climate emotions and pro-environmental behavior.",Psychology
1127,,"The brain's ability to change – its plasticity – in response to new environments, experiences or damage, is the foundation of cognition. Unravelling the mechanisms of plasticity in humans is a central goal for neuroscience. This chapter provides an overview of common methods used to study structural and functional brain plasticity in humans. The main structural methods we discuss are T1-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), which is widely used to track anatomical changes in the brain, and Positron Emission Tomography (PET), which allows investigation of neurochemical processes, such as receptor density changes. The section on functional plasticity evolves around (T2*-weighted) functional MRI (fMRI) and attempts to provide an overview of analysis methods and MRI sequences that can be used to study functional changes in the brain, including resting state analysis, univariate and multivariate analyses. We further provide a short summary of non-invasive brain stimulation methods that, combined with other structural or functional methods, have proven to be useful tools for inducing and measuring plasticity. We also address limitations of these methods, in particular for tracking fast or microscopic changes and discuss the importance of a good study design that ensures measurements match the research question. This emphasises the benefits of combining non-invasive brain imaging with longitudinal designs to reveal the nature of plasticity in humans.",Psychology
1128,,"A growing body of research suggests that spontaneous eye blinks have a cognitive role in addition to their biological functions. Blinking has been associated with cognitive effort and processes related to the dynamic nature of incoming sensory information such as the release of attention. However, there is limited evidence supporting the cognitive role of spontaneous blinks, specifically during reading. This study provides the first systematic investigation of blinking patterns in eye-tracking data of naturalistic silent text reading. We hypothesized that blinks would be more likely to occur (1) around punctuation marks signaling a breakpoint in the text and (2) following fixations on lower-frequency words. To test these hypotheses, we utilized data from the large Ghent Eye Tracking Corpus (GECO), which includes eye movement data from 15 participants who read an entire novel in silence. The results indicate higher blinking proportions at punctuation marks compared to other positions in the text. Additionally, blink rates were modulated by word frequency, with higher word frequencies significantly reducing the probability of blinking. Extending previous research, our findings suggest substantial top-down regulation of blinking during reading.",Psychology
1129,,"Purpose: This study investigates whether inner speech—the mental rehearsal of words without articulation—facilitates naming recovery in individuals with aphasia. We hypothesized that items with preserved inner speech but impaired overt naming at baseline would improve more after speech therapy than items without inner speech. 
Method: Nineteen participants with chronic, expressive aphasia participated in three pre-treatment naming sessions, nine treatment sessions (semantic feature analysis), and three post-treatment naming sessions. For each pre- and post-treatment naming session, participants named ~300 items (pictures of nouns) aloud and also indicated whether they had inner speech for each item. Based on pre-treatment naming sessions, 30 individualized items (“Treated30”) were trained using semantic feature analysis.  Mixed-effects models analyzed the effect of treatment, inner speech, psycholinguistic properties, and aphasia severity on naming outcomes immediately post-treatment. 
Results: There was an average of 60.8% proportional improvement on overt naming and 41% improvement on inner speech for the Treated30 from baseline to follow-up. In a series of hierarchical mixed models, baseline inner speech, inner speech across the study, aphasia severity, and interactions of inner speech variables with treatment were significant in predicting correct naming post-therapy. 
Conclusions: Findings suggest a bidirectional relationship between inner and overt speech: baseline inner speech and, importantly, improvements in inner speech significantly influence therapy-related gains in naming. These results suggest that inner speech-focused interventions may improve outcomes by providing a cognitive scaffold for speech production.",Psychology
1130,,"Background: Consumers are increasingly using LLM-based chatbots to seek mental health advice or intervention due to ease of access and limited availability of mental health professionals. However, their suitability and safety for mental health applications remain underexplored, particularly in comparison to professional therapeutic practices.
Objective: This study aimed to evaluate how general-purpose chatbots respond to mental health scenarios and compare their responses to those provided by licensed therapists. Specifically, we sought to identify chatbots’ strengths, limitations, and the ethical and practical considerations necessary for their use in mental health care.
Methods: We conducted a mixed methods study to compare responses from chatbots and licensed therapists to scripted mental health scenarios. We created two fictional scenarios and prompted 3 chatbots to create six interaction logs. We recruited 17 therapists and conducted study sessions that consisted of three activities. First, therapists responded to the two scenarios using a Qualtrics form. Second, therapists went through the six interaction logs using a think aloud procedure to highlight their thoughts about the chatbots’ responses. Lastly, we conducted a semi-structured interview to explore subjective opinions on the use of chatbots for supporting mental health. The study sessions were analyzed using thematic analysis. The interaction logs from chatbot and therapist responses were coded using the Multitheoretical List of Therapeutic Interventions codes and then compared to each other.
Results: We identified seven themes describing the strengths and limitations of the chatbots as compared to therapists. These include elements of good therapy in chatbot’s responses, conversational style of chatbots, insufficient inquiry and feedback seeking by chatbots, chatbot interventions, client engagement, chatbots’ responses to crisis situations, and considerations for chatbot-based therapy. In the use of MULTI codes, we found that therapists evoked more elaboration (t = 4.50, p = 0.001) and employed more self-disclosure (t = 1.05, p = 0.31) as compared to the chatbots. The chatbots used affirming (t = 1.71, p = 0.10) and reassuring (t = 2.29, p = 0.03) language more often than the therapists. The chatbots also employed psychoeducation (t = 2.69, p = 0.01) and suggestions (t = 4.23, p = 0.001) more often than the therapists did.
Conclusions: Our study demonstrates the unsuitability of general purpose chatbots to safely engage in mental health conversations, particularly in crisis situations. While chatbots display elements of good therapy, such as validation and reassurance, overuse of directive advice without sufficient inquiry, and use of generic interventions makes them unsuitable as therapeutic agents. Careful research and evaluation will be necessary to determine the impact of chatbot interactions and to identify the most appropriate use cases related to mental health.",Psychology
1131,,"This study investigates the longitudinal linking of dichotomous item responses at three time points, focusing on the performance of Haberman linking, Haebara linking, Stocking-Lord linking, and concurrent calibration in the presence of item parameter drift (IPD). Two general linking approaches, joint and chain linking, are examined. Three simulation studies were conducted to compare these methods under different conditions of IPD and linking designs. The first simulation study compared linking methods under conditions of sampling error and uniform IPD, with results indicating that the Haberman joint linking method performed best regarding bias and root mean square error (RMSE), especially at larger sample sizes, while the concurrent calibration method was most accurate when no IPD was present. The second simulation study expanded the analysis by introducing two additional linking designs: one relying solely on anchor items across all three time points, and the other using only adjacent items between consecutive time points. Both designs were examined under the same conditions as the first study, revealing that under no IPD conditions, the concurrent calibration method remained the most precise across both designs, while under uniform IPD conditions, the Haberman linking methods outperformed other methods, offering the best balance of bias and precision. The third study examined nonuniform IPD, where the Haberman chain linking method delivered the best overall performance in terms of both bias and RMSE. Overall, chain linking methods generally outperformed joint linking when IPD was present. Implications for the analysis of longitudinal linking designs are discussed.",Psychology
1132,,"Recognition of a word and its meaning benefits from the sensorimotor information about concepts. However, this phenomenon has been underexplored in second language (L2) speakers who may rely on more “shallow” representations. Using a megastudy dataset, we investigate how sensorimotor strength affects L1 and L2 word recognition performance. Bayesian hierarchical regressions revealed that variables associated with physical sensations (interoceptive strength, motor action) and communication experience (head or mouth movement, auditory strength) produced strong effects in both groups. On the other hand, variables associated with concrete objects (visual, haptic experience) and with taste/smell (olfactory, gustatory experience) influenced L1 word recognition performance to a larger extent than in L2. In L2, reliance on semantic information during word recognition is reduced, with stronger effects of lexical variables compared to L1. The findings provide implications for understanding second language processing mechanisms and demonstrate the usefulness of megastudy datasets in investigating L2 conceptual representations.",Psychology
1133,,"Introduction. The robust linguistic and clinical research literature focusing on English language acquisition is generally based on a model that presumes that the oral language a child acquires at home without formal instruction is the same language that is used for reading and writing. Arabic presents a qualitatively different scenario, in that children learning Arabic must acquire at least two different language systems: (1) a dialectal form that is largely used for informal interactions and which is not formally codified, and (2) a standard form, which is typically used in formal contexts and is almost exclusively reserved for reading and writing. Multilingual Arabic speakers are among the fastest growing language communities in the United States (US), yet very little is known about language development in Arabic-English speaking children, leading to critical knowledge gaps in language acquisition theory, assessment, and intervention. This project was designed to provide an initial overview of the Arabic-English language learning environment by addressing the following research questions: 
RQ 1: Do demographic characteristics such as parent sex and parent education influence caregiver reported parent-child use of language outside of the home in the standard form and spoken/home language form?
RQ 2: Do demographic characteristics such as parent sex and parent education influence caregiver reported child grammatical outcomes, such as verb use, tense, and agreement? 
Method. A community-based participatory approach was utilized for participant recruitment. The author partnered with community stakeholders to recruit a pilot sample of 42 families to the study. This study received institutional review board approval and followed all ethical guidelines. Questionnaires assessing caregiver ratings of their children’s language skills and the language richness of the home environment was administered in person within participants’ homes or in locations selected by participants (e.g., community centers). Families who consented were audio recorded for fidelity.",Psychology
1134,,"Abstract
Foreign language effect (FLE) refers to the observed differences in responding to judgment and decision-making problems presented in native (L1) or foreign language (L2). The present research aimed to investigate whether L2 use could impact the judgment of bullshit, and, provided that the impact is observed, if the mechanisms behind the FLE could rely on emotionality. Bullshit is a form of meaningless material that is grammatically and syntactically correct, and has been studied in empirical psychology. We conducted two studies with participants differing in L2 proficiency. The participants were instructed to evaluate the profoundness of positive, negative, and neutral bullshit and mundane statements in their L1 and L2. The results suggest that people are more prone to accept the profundity of emotionally charged bullshit, whereas L2 use mostly impacts the judgment of less proficient speakers – it could diminish their ability to detect neutral nonsense and refute the profundity of negative mundane statements. This implies the dependence of FLE on valence, meaning, and their interaction. We discuss findings within Dual Process accounts of reasoning, noting that both emotional involvement and using a L2 lead to quick, intuitive processing. Therefore, to sound profound, use emotional words or a foreign language!",Psychology
1135,,"Background: Suicidal behaviour is a critical mental health issue in the adolescent population, often linked to serious emotional problems that leave survivors vulnerable to future risk. Psychological crises in adolescence are primarily associated with relational conflicts, with emotional crises involving depression or anxiety significantly increasing suicidal risk. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the rates of suicidal behaviour in adolescents undergoing emotional crises and explore their association with psychiatric diagnoses and demographic factors in Ecuador. Methods: An observational, correlational study using a quantitative approach was conducted. Data from 252 adolescents admitted to the Crisis Intervention Unit at the Institute of Neurosciences in Guayaquil, Ecuador, between 2011 and 2023 were analysed. Hospitalisation frequencies by year, gender, and associated psychiatric diagnoses were assessed. Data were obtained from each patient's unified clinical history. Results: Seventy-five percent of the patients were female, with 48% aged 17–18 years. Most adolescents were single (98%), and 86% had a secondary education level. The most frequent diagnosis was a depressive episode (73.4%), with 156 patients presenting suicidal ideation. Cutting and ingestion of psychotropic drugs were the most common suicide methods, predominantly among females. Logistic regression showed that a combination of an eating disorder and a depressive episode was associated with a lower likelihood of suicidal ideation or attempts. Conclusions: The high frequency of suicidal behaviour in adolescent females aged 16–18 years underscores the need for targeted prevention programs addressing emotional crises and stress management in this high-risk group.",Psychology

1137,,"Growth mixture models (GMMs) are popular approaches for modeling unobserved population
heterogeneity over time. GMMs can be extended with covariates, predicting latent class (LC)
membership, the within-class growth trajectories, or both. However current estimators are
sensitive to misspecifications in complex models. We propose extending the two-step estimator
for LC models to GMMs, which provides robust estimation against model
misspecifications for simpler LC models.

We conducted several simulation studies, comparing the performance of the proposed
two-step estimator to the commonly-used one- and three-step estimators.
Three different population models were considered, including covariates that predicted only the
LC membership (I), adding direct effects to the latent intercept (II), or to both growth factors
(III).

Results show that when predicting LC membership alone, all three estimators are unbiased when the measurement model is strong, with weak measurement model results being more
nuanced. Alternatively, when including covariate effects on the growth factors, the two-step, and
three-step estimators show consistent robustness against misspecifications with unbiased estimates across simulation conditions while tending to underestimate the standard error estimates
while the one-step estimator is most sensitive to misspecifications.",Psychology
1138,,"The proliferation of self-report measures for psychological constructs, often developed without
systematic evidence, raises concerns about construct redundancy and the validity of research
findings. This study provides a comprehensive review of scales designed to assess subjective
time, employing literature analysis and transformer-based natural language processing (NLP)
methods to explore semantic relationships among these measures. Thirty scales meeting
inclusion criteria were identified, revealing two primary clusters: temporal experience and time
perspective. Temporal experience encompasses diverse dimensions of how individuals
perceive and conceptualize time, while time perspective focuses on orientations toward past,
present, and future. Hierarchical clustering and semantic analysis highlighted overlaps and
distinctions. Our findings underscore recurring challenges in differentiating between
theoretically distinct constructs, such as temporal orientation and time perspective, due to
significant overlap in operationalizations. Furthermore, discrepancies between theoretical
definitions and scale content emphasize the importance of scrutinizing alignment to ensure
validity. Automated semantic analysis offers a valuable tool for identifying redundancy and
improving measurement clarity, particularly given the proliferation of self-report measures in
psychology. However, methodological variations and domain expertise are crucial to
interpreting results meaningfully. This study demonstrates the utility of NLP in advancing the
conceptual and empirical understanding of subjective time while highlighting the need for more
robust and distinct measurement approaches.",Psychology
1139,,"In the past few decades, there has been ongoing debate regarding whether and how physical activity is related to cognitive development. The current study attempted to advance our understanding of this topic by exploring how various facets of physical activity—both quantitative and qualitative—are linked to specific cognitive functions in adolescents. The sample was 3527 adolescents from the United Kingdom Millennium Cohort Study. At age 14, adolescents’ daily activity content, duration, and intensity on weekdays and weekends were assessed using both an activity monitor and a time-use diary. Cognitive skills, including executive function and academic achievement, were measured at ages 14 and 17, respectively. Multiple hierarchical regressions revealed that a greater amount of time spent in moderate-to-vigorous activity (MVPA) was predictive of better executive function at age 14 but unrelated to academic outcome at age 17. In analysing adolescents’ activity content, it was found that open-skills sports were more closely associated with executive function, with team ball games exhibiting the strongest effect. In contrast, regular engagement in individual ball games and swimming was related to better academic outcomes. Our findings confirm the link between MVPA and cognitive functions in the adolescent population and highlight the beneficial effect of open-skill sports on adolescents’ cognitive development.",Psychology
1140,,"Despite the growing body of research on the intergenerational transmission of problem behavior, there is a need for more integrative approaches that consider the interplay between genetic and environmental factors.

In path analyses, independent and relative contributions of genetic (polygenic scores of parents and offspring) and environmental (harsh parenting) pathways were tested. Results confirm intergenerational transmission and consistently point to genetic nurture whereby genetic predisposition predicts parental problem behavior, which in turn predicts harsh parenting, which in turn predicts offspring problem behavior, all while accounting for offspring genetic predisposition, sex and family socioeconomic position. Though these findings are surprising in light of genetic contributions to behavior, they allow for tentative considerations regarding implication for practice to break intergenerational chains of problem behavior.",Psychology
1141,,"This study analyzes the construct validity of Student Evaluation of Teaching (SET) questionnaires applied in a university context.

The SET questionnaires, designed to assess nine dimensions of teaching quality, were analyzed for their effectiveness to capture differential teaching perceptions. The analysis incorporated socio-cognitive factors, based on the Central Model of Student Perception (CSP model), which studies how the perception and facilitative effect of teaching influences student response. Results indicate that students can distinguish between specific dimensions of teaching, which supports the validity of the questionnaire, although challenges related to possible perceptual biases and item interpretation persist.

1143,,"The performance of standard reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms depends on the scale of the rewards they aim to maximize. Various strategies have been proposed to tackle this issue, but these usually restrict the algorithms' ability to adapt to varying task conditions and evolve in open-ended environments. Inspired by human cognitive processes, we propose leveraging a well-known cognitive bias to develop scale-invariant RL algorithms: reward range normalization. We compare a classical RL algorithm to one leveraging reward range-adaptation, finding that while the standard model’s accuracy is limited to certain reward magnitudes, the range-adapted model maintains consistent performance across all magnitudes. We next show that range-adaptation acts as autonomously adjusting the exploration rate, keeping it close to optimal for any given reward scale. Further, we show that the range-adapted model extends effectively to more complex, noisy, dynamic, and multi-step tasks.",Psychology
1144,,"Importance  Preliminary evidence is lacking for the engagement and efficacy levels of mental health platforms that enable patients to self-select certain characteristics of their providers. 
Objective  To determine the characteristics, engagement, and clinical outcomes of adult patients who used a technology-enabled platform to access outpatient mental health services and explore associations between type of provider selection and outcomes. 
Design, Setting, and Participants  This real world retrospective study of 304,251 patients 18 or older with a first visit to a provider in 2022-2023 using data routinely collected in the Grow Therapy platform.
Main Outcomes and Measures  Engagement was defined by the total number of visits with a Grow Therapy provider. Clinical outcomes were derived from changes in repeated self-reported scores on the standardized Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Assessment-7 (GAD-7) surveys administered before the first and most recent treatment visits. Adjusted logistic and linear regression was used for the analyses examining type of provider characteristic selected, engagement, and changes in each clinical outcome.
Results  This study included Grow Therapy patients (mean age 34.0 years; 69.8% identifying as female). Over a quarter of patients selected a provider specialty (27.1%) and 4.4% selected a provider identity. Patients met with their provider a mean of 9.6 times (67.4% had 3 or more visits) and, among complete case patients with at least 2 PHQ-9 and 2 GAD-7 assessments (n=67,105), a large proportion showed significantly improved symptoms of depression (PHQ-9 improvement=3.5, 60.0% with a minimal clinically important difference [MCID]) and anxiety (GAD-7 improvement=3.5, 66.1% MCID). Patients selecting a provider specialty had fewer visits but had greater declines in depression symptoms, and those selecting a provider identity engaged longer in care than patients not selecting each of these characteristics, respectively.
Conclusions and Relevance  This real world study demonstrates that a technology-enabled mental health platform that allows patients to self-select their provider is engaging and preliminarily efficacious. Patients may maximize benefits of these platforms by selecting preferred characteristics of their providers.",Psychology

The results indicated that young children were more likely to expect to seek help from familiar teachers, particularly those who previously responded positively. In contrast, young children were hesitant to expect to seek help from unfamiliar teachers, regardless of their response quality.

1146,,"Introduction: Current National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines recommend family interventions for children and adolescents with psychosis. However, the evidence to support this has not been fully synthesised to date. This meta-analytic review aimed to investigate whether family interventions are effective in reducing psychosis symptoms and improving general functioning among children and adolescents with psychosis.
Methods: Multiple databases were searched per the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, supplemented by grey literature searches. Studies employing controlled designs to compare family interventions with other interventions or standard care were included. Study quality was assessed with the Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tools. Bayesian meta-analyses were conducted to examine changes in psychosis symptoms and functioning. 
Results: Four studies (n = 111) met inclusion criteria. All studies assessed the effectiveness of different psychoeducation-based family interventions with varying duration and intensity. The quality of the studies ranged from a moderate to a critical risk of bias. The meta-analyses showed no significant effect of family interventions on psychosis symptoms or functioning and indicated anecdotal evidence in favour of the null hypotheses. 
Discussion: We did not find evidence of a significant benefit of family interventions on psychosis symptoms or functioning in children and adolescents with psychosis. All included studies had significant methodological issues, which may have introduced bias. These results highlight a lack of evidence of the effectiveness of family interventions in children and adolescents with psychosis, and a need for high-quality research into psychosocial treatments for early-onset psychosis.",Psychology
1147,,"Head motion is one of the most common sources of artefacts for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the brain. Especially children, being intimidated by the dimensions and the noise of the scanner, tend to move considerably during image acquisition. Thus, the use of general anaesthesia or sedation is common practice in clinical routines to avoid motion artefacts. However, general anaesthesia requires additional equipment and personnel and concerns about potential drug-related risks are increasing.
With this thesis, I aim to compare different methods for motion correction of MRI as alternative strategies for avoiding motion artefacts during clinical MRI examinations. I evaluate the performance of prospective and retrospective motion correction on a set of six 2D- and 3D-encoded sequences from a clinical pediatric MR protocol. For each sequence, we acquired scans with and without a predefined motion pattern in 22 healthy volunteers. I analyse and statistically compare a set of image quality
measures as well as observer quality scores. Furthermore, I quantify the influence of motion correction on motion-related changes in cortical thickness estimates using a general linear model.
In this work, I show that for the 3D-encoded sequences, image quality considerably increases from scans without motion correction, over retrospectively to prospectively corrected scans. Selectively reacquiring slices with the highest level of motion additionally improved image quality. Furthermore, cortical thickness estimates from motion corrected scans do not correlate with motion to the same extent as observed for uncorrected scans. For three of the 2D-encoded sequences I observe higher image quality due motion correction and reacquisition compared to the clinical standard, even though the effect size varies between the different sequences. I did not observe an improvement due to motion correction in the T2* sequence, which is known to be highly sensitive to field inhomogeneities.  owever, this sequence can be substituted by an accelerated, easily repeatable sequence. My findings confirm that the use of prospective motion correction is feasible for a full clinical children's protocol, reducing motion artefacts and ensuring diagnostic image quality. As a next step in establishing motion correction in clinical routines, the developed and validated set up will be tested on a clinical pediatric population.",Psychology

In all conditions,  events which were causally or semantically central to the story were better recalled. However, even when all participants read the exact same events, those with full control recalled more idiosyncratic combinations of events. Moreover, their memories were less well predicted by generic sentence embeddings, suggesting a shift away from normative semantic space. Agency also increased the likelihood of jointly remembering or forgetting consecutive events. These results reveal that agency fundamentally reshapes memory organization, increasing the influence of idiosyncratic personal factors and strengthening local temporal integration.",Psychology
1150,,"Given that the emotions associated with a stimulus affect its memorability, cognitive psychologists have long been interested in the intersection of emotion and memory. The bulk of such research has investigated the role of emotion in memory by examining the mnemonic effects of affective dimensions such as valence and arousal. However, in addition to studying such dimensions, the consideration of well-established theories of emotion from affective science represents a fruitful source of ideas whose implications for episodic memory have not yet been thoroughly investigated. In the current paper, we propose a model of emotional memory inspired by psychological constructionist theories of emotion, which conceive of emotions as emergent phenomena constructed when perceivers use conceptual knowledge to make sense of affective sensations in context. The constructionist model of emotional memory (CMEM) generates several novel directions for future research, such as investigating the mnemonic consequences of conceptual emotion knowledge, and considering the effects of variability in emotion construction at the situational, individual, and cultural levels.",Psychology
1151,,"Background: The proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) applications for mental health has advanced in recent years and shows promise to increase the reach, scope, and impact of mental healthcare. However, biases in algorithms designed to assess and treat mental health problems pose risk for equitable mental health. This cross-sectional study investigates the existence of bias in algorithms for detecting stress from mobile devices and its implications for mental health equity.
Methods: A diverse sample of young adults (N = 212) carried smartphones, wore physiological sensors, and completed hourly surveys assessing their subjective stress for 24 hours. We then developed a Twin Neural Network machine learning (ML) model to detect hourly stress from smartphone and wearable data and evaluated model performance across gender and ethnic/racial status. 
Findings: The model performed moderately well overall yet showed significant variation in performance ranging from poor to good across gender and ethnic/racial groups. In particular, the model evidenced lower performance in women compared to men and overestimated the frequency of stress episodes for Hispanic/Latina women.
Interpretation: Findings highlight the presence of bias in AI applications for mental health and underscore the need for cautious interpretation of ML outcomes in historically underrepresented groups. Discussion focuses on the implications of AI bias for mental health and the importance of developing methods that combine AI and social justice perspectives to ensure the implementation of equitable mental healthcare.

This study explores personalized versus generalized machine learning models for detecting individual and family mental health symptoms using data from smartphones and smartwatches collected on the Colliga app. Over 60 days, data from 35 families resulted in approximately 14 million data points from 52 data streams. Findings showed that the personalized models outperformed the generalized models. Model performance varied significantly based on individual factors and symptom profiles, highlighting the need for tailored approaches. These results suggest that successful implementation of passive sensing AI technologies for mental health interventions requires considering each user’s unique characteristics. Further research is needed to refine the models, address data stream heterogeneity, and develop scalable systems for effective personalized mental health interventions.",Psychology
1153,,"Background
Early maladaptive schemas (EMS) significantly impact psychological functioning, yet their prevalence and influence within non-clinical populations are under-researched. This study explores distinct EMS clusters in a non-clinical adult sample and examines their associations with personality traits and emotional experiences.
Methods
Ninety-one adults (mean age 42.5) completed the Young Schema Questionnaire (YSQ-S3), Big Five Inventory (BFI), Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), and Dispositional Positive Emotion Scales (DPES). K-means clustering identified EMS patterns, and relationships between EMS clusters, personality traits, and affective states were analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis tests, t-tests, and Spearman’s rank correlations.
Results
Three EMS clusters—Low, Medium, and High intensity—were found. Neuroticism varied significantly across all clusters (p &lt; .001), showing a strong positive correlation with most EMS. Entitlement/Grandiosity was uniquely uncorrelated with Neuroticism but negatively associated with Agreeableness. Within the Medium cluster, two personality types emerged, distinguished by Neuroticism and Extraversion. The High EMS cluster had significantly greater Negative Affect than the Low cluster (p = .002). Love and Pride dispositions differed across clusters (p ≤ .001), showing negative correlations with specific EMS.
Conclusions
This study identifies distinct EMS patterns in non-clinical adults, highlighting Neuroticism as a major factor in EMS intensity and Entitlement/Grandiosity as a unique schema with atypical personality links. The findings reveal a “Schema Continuum” in the general population, challenging the clinical/non-clinical divide. Interventions targeting Neuroticism and enhancing positive emotions like Love and Pride may reduce maladaptive schemas, suggesting a path for preventative mental health strategies.",Psychology
1154,,"Psychological inoculation is a promising and potentially scalable approach to counter misinformation. The goal of inoculation is to teach people to recognize manipulation techniques, such as emotional language, commonly found in misinformation online. While there is substantial evidence that inoculation increases technique recognition when directly assessed, it is not clear if this effect transfers to spontaneous detection of techniques and disengagement with the associated content in real-life contexts. In particular, emotional appeals are abundant on social media and known drivers of attention and engagement. Therefore, we examined the effects of emotional language and emotional manipulation inoculation on attention and engagement in a simulated social media feed environment. Through five pre-registered studies, we found that inoculation only decreased engagement with emotionally presented content when we solely presented synthetic content relevant to the task of identifying emotional manipulation. Any addition of real tweets or even synthetic tweets containing other manipulation techniques (e.g., ad hominem attacks) into the feed appeared to nullify the effect. Our results highlight the importance of assessing misinformation interventions in ecologically-valid contexts to estimate real-world effects.",Psychology
1155,,"Purpose: Current reading research remains Latin script-centric in a monoliterate context, and may not be generalizable to the significant percentage of school-aged children growing up as biscriptal bilinguals globally. To address this, we examined the early stages of reading development in bilingual readers of an under-studied language combination that differs across orthographic depth and script. Specifically, our longitudinal study compared within-language contributions of three phonological processing skills to reading outcomes in Urdu-English bilingual children. Method: We assessed 154 Urdu-English readers in Pakistan and Canada on their phonological awareness, phonological memory, and rapid automatized naming (RAN) skills at Timepoint 1 (Senior Kindergarten) and word/non-word reading accuracy and fluency outcomes at Timepoint 2 (Grade 1) in Urdu (orthographically-transparent language with Perso-Arabic script) and English (orthographically-opaque language with Latin script). Results: Our multivariate multiple linear regression analyses demonstrate the importance of phonological awareness and RAN for reading, across orthographic depth/script and type of reading outcome measure. Predictive strength differences were also evident. Phonological awareness accounted for greater variance in the reading accuracy measure across both languages and particularly in Urdu, with RAN contributing greater variance to Urdu reading fluency. Phonological memory was not a significant predictor in either language. Conclusions: Our study contributes to the generalizability of dominant reading models, such as the Psycholinguistic Grain Size Theory (PGST), Orthographic Depth Hypothesis (ODH), and Speed-of-Processing theoretical account of RAN-reading fluency relationship, beyond monoliterate readers of Latin scripts. Particularly, we demonstrate the importance of phonological awareness and RAN for reading outcomes in biliterate readers of a transparent orthography with a Perso-Arabic script.",Psychology
1156,,"Introduction: Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in the United States. We evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a digital incentive-based intervention for tobacco cessation among Medicaid beneficiaries with a pilot micro-randomized trial.
Methods: Participants (N=37; 63.9% annual income &lt;$15,000), self-enrolled across community-based health centers, were incentivized monetarily to submit breath samples twice daily for four weeks, with additional incentives for negative samples (≤6 parts per million carbon monoxide). Participants were randomized twice daily with fixed probability (0.48) to be sent motivational messages or not via an app. We evaluate acceptability and feasibility of the program. Using a generalization of regression suitable for a binary outcome, we examine the average effect of delivering a message (vs. no message) on proximal sample submissions and smoking status.
Results: Thirty-three participants who completed a post-test assessment (97.1%) reported would recommend the program to others. Participants submitted samples during 69.5% of submission windows and 61.3% of participants were smoke free at post-test. After adjusting for previous sample submission, participants were 7% more likely (risk ratio (RR) 1.073; 95% confidence interval [CI]: [1.010,1.140]) to submit a sample after a motivational message was delivered (vs. not delivered). Participants were 7% less likely (RR 0.931; 95%CI: [0.827,1.048]) to submit a positive sample (vs. negative), although not statistically significant.
Conclusions: The results support the incorporation of motivational messages into research involving incentive-based treatments for tobacco cessation.",Psychology
1157,,"The digital revolution has exponentially increased the availability of unstructured text data, including social media content, online forums, blogs, e-commerce reviews, news articles, and digitized publications. This wealth of textual data offers social scientists a unique opportunity to study human beliefs, values, attitudes, and interactions. However, this emerging field lacks standardized methods for managing its methodological and statistical challenges. To this end, this work introduces a statistical approach that provides tools to implement an informed measurement process on unstructured textual data. The proposed approach is grounded in the longstanding tradition of Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), now enhanced by the integration of word embeddings. This machine-learning technique represents words in a continuous vector space based on their semantic relationships. By merging classical CFA with machine learning models, the approach opens up new possibilities for applying tools developed by the CFA community for researchers interested in big textual datasets.",Psychology
1158,,"As they age, adolescents tend to prefer sleeping and waking later due to biological maturation, social and environmental factors. Higher eveningness preferences relate to risks of developing physical and mental ill-health and/or academic underachievement. To identify individuals who are more vulnerable to these negative outcomes, prior studies have mostly established percentile cutoffs scores in questionnaires of moningness-eveningness (M-E) preferences, a method that is inefficient and leads to biased estimates, and/or used linear methods, which do not consider that M-E can fit other types of distribution. We reanalyzed cross-sectional data of 1815 10-18-year-old Brazilians who filled in the most popular circadian preference scale, the M-E Scale for Children (MESC). Age/sex differences in MESC scores were analyzed using correlations, general linear models and 44 different curve fittings based on fractional polynomials and exponential data transformation. We found a very slight correlation and general linear increase in eveningness with age, but none of the 44 tested curve fit patterns reliably explained score changes across development, which were highly variable at all ages. We conclude that MESC age reference scores are of little practical value. We discuss conditions which must be combined with MESC scores to identify adolescents at risk of circadian-related problem.",Psychology
1159,,"University students' mental health is a growing concern, with increasing rates of  distress, particularly among healthcare students. Virtual Reality (VR) shows promise in promoting relaxation and reducing stress in young people. This randomised controlled trial evaluated a novel VR intervention for healthcare students' wellbeing.
131 healthcare students at St George's, University of London were randomised to either VR (n=67) or video control (n=64) groups. The intervention consisted of five daily sessions of clinically-informed hypnotherapy-based experiences. Outcomes included perceived stress (PSS), wellbeing (WEMWBS), depression (PHQ-2), and momentary affective states. Assessments occurred at baseline, post-session, and at two-week follow-up.
VR participants showed significantly greater improvements in post-session mood states compared to the video group. At two-week follow-up, the VR group demonstrated significant reductions in perceived stress (within-group effect size g=0.57) compared to video controls (g=0.21). VR participants reported significantly higher immersion levels and intervention satisfaction. No significant between-group differences were found for wellbeing or depression measures. Qualitative data indicated stronger therapeutic benefits in the VR group, with 42/47 VR participants reporting positive effects compared to 17/50 in the video group.
The VR intervention effectively reduced stress levels in healthcare students, with effects sustained at two-week follow-up. The immersive nature of VR appeared to enhance therapeutic benefits compared to non-immersive delivery. This suggests VR could be a valuable tool for supporting student wellbeing in higher education settings.",Psychology
1160,,"Studies show that cognitive activities are reflected by certain pupillary responses, where increased arousal and cognitive effort are typically accompanied by greater pupil dilation. This pupillary response is usually amplified upon presentation of negative or threatening stimuli. Yet, there is a lack of literature describing the opposite relationship, i.e., pupil size being a predictor of efficient threat-detection abilities rather than a criterion. In a lab experiment, we investigated whether pupil size predicted response time and decision in a computer-based visual search task. Subjects were presented with real-life images of different people holding various objects and were asked to indicate the presence or absence of a black handgun in the stimulus material. The analyses showed that larger pupil sizes during the fixation period were a valid predictor of shorter response times after stimulus onset as was the number of trials completed and experience with guns. Pupil size was not associated with the subjects’ decisions. We believe that the link between pupil dilation and increased cognitive effort and engagement accounts for the results and discuss the implications for successful threat-detection.",Psychology
1161,,"Background: Induction of negative mood increases tobacco choice in dependent smokers; however, less is known about the mechanisms behind this. This study addressed this gap by applying a computational model of value-based decision-making to tobacco and tobacco-unrelated choices following mood manipulation. Method: Using a pre-registered, within-subject design, 49 daily tobacco smokers (›10 daily cigarettes) watched two different videos which primed them to experience negative and positive mood (tobacco valuation and devaluation, respectively). Participants completed self-report measures of mood and craving to smoke before and after priming, followed by a two-alternative forced-choice task with (separate) blocks of tobacco-related and unrelated (animal) images. On each block, participants selected the image that they previously rated higher. A drift-diffusion model was fitted to the reaction time and error data to estimate evidence accumulation (EA) processes and response thresholds during the different blocks. Results: After watching videos intended to induce negative mood, happiness scores were lower (p ‹ .001, d = 1.16), while sadness and craving to smoke scores were higher (both ps ‹ .001, ds › .60), compared to after watching videos intended to induce positive mood. However, contrary to hypotheses, the experimental manipulation did not robustly affect EA rates (F = 1.15, p = .29, ηp2 = .02) or response thresholds (F = .07, p = .79, ηp2 = .00) for either tobacco or tobacco-unrelated decisions. Conclusions: Manipulation of mood in daily smokers did not lead to alterations in the internal processes that precede value-based decisions made about tobacco and tobacco-unrelated cues.",Psychology
1162,,"So-called ‘mismatch accounts’ propose that, rather than arising from a socio-cognitive deficit present in autistic people, mentalising difficulties are the product of a mismatch in neurotype between interaction partners. Although this idea has grown in popularity over the recent years, there is currently only limited empirical evidence to support mismatch theories. Moreover, the social model of disability such theories are grounded in demands a culturally situated view of social interaction, yet research on mentalising and/or autism is largely biased towards western countries, with little knowledge on how successful mentalising is defined differently, and how tools to assess socio-cognitive ability compare, across cultures. Using a widely employed mentalising task, the current study investigated and compared the bi-directional mentalising performance of British and Japanese autistic and non-autistic adults and assessed observer-agent kinematic similarity as a potential dimension along which mismatches may occur between neurotypes. Participants were asked to depict various mental state- and action-based interactions by moving two triangles across a touch-screen device, before viewing and interpreting stimuli generated by other participants. In the UK sample, our results replicate a seminal prior study in showing poorer mentalising abilities in non-autistic adults for animations generated by the autistic group. Crucially, the same pattern did not emerge in the Japanese sample, where there were no mentalising differences between the two groups. Limitations of the current study include that efforts to match all samples within and across cultures in terms of IQ, gender and age were not successful for all comparisons, but control analyses suggest this did not affect our results. Furthermore, any performance differences were found for both the mental state- and action-based conditions, mirroring prior work and raising questions about the domain-specificity of the employed task. Our results add support for a paradigm shift in the autism literature, moving beyond deficit-based models and towards acknowledging the inherently relational nature of social interaction. We further discuss how our findings suggest limited cultural transferability of common socio-cognitive measures rather than superior mentalising abilities in Japanese autistic adults, underscoring the need for more cross-cultural research and the development of culturally sensitive scientific and diagnostic tools.",Psychology
1163,,"The concept of healthy ageing and its impact on spatial navigation and memory ability is well-established in the literature. However, the neural basis of these age-related changes is not well understood. In particular, there is limited research that examines the impact of healthy ageing on the neural mechanisms underlying spatial memory retrieval for memories encoded recently (24-hours ago) compared to those encoded remotely (1-month ago). This study attempted to explore the neural basis of recent and remote spatial memory retrieval during navigation in older adults (n = 21) compared to younger adults (n = 31) using EEG and a virtual maze task. Our results suggest that although both recent and remote memories were poorer in older compared to younger adults, older adults’ remote memories were relatively well preserved. In parallel, we showed reduced high-frequency oscillations in older adults for both recent and remote conditions compared to younger adults. Specifically, older adults showed decreased activation at 15 – 30 Hz (beta) as well as a failure to increase activation at 30 – 40 Hz (gamma) frequencies when compared to younger adults. While remote memory evoked increases in delta and theta (2 - 7 Hz) frequencies compared to recent memories in both age groups, older adults showed significantly less increase. We suggest that these differences could relate to the storage of the memories and the regions required for retrieval. The results are discussed in terms of age-related compensation for spatial navigation skills in healthy ageing.",Psychology
1164,,"The study aimed to explore the understudied area of typical adult handwriting performance, focusing on the potential predictive roles of fine motor skills and executive functions. While the initial stages of handwriting acquisition are assumed to rely upon executive functions and fine motor skills, both components are no longer viewed as needed in automatized, expert handwriting. We tested this assumption by assessing the contributions of these components to handwriting performance in a group of 33 adult participants. Linear regressions were used to examine whether dexterity, manual praxis, working memory, inhibition and flexibility predict handwriting speed, legibility, and fluency. Results revealed that fine motor skills were a significant contributor to all aspects of handwriting performance. Executive functions also predicted handwriting performance, with a significant effect of flexibility on writing speed and of working memory on legibility. These findings highlight that, even at a high level of expertise and automatization, handwriting remains a motor skill whose performance depends on executive and fine motor control capacities. They suggest a predictive coding account of graphomotor control, whereby internal forward and inverse models would support the execution and monitoring of handwriting movements. This raises important questions about the extent to which disorders in motor and executive processes can affect handwriting performance and highlights the need for further research into this complex motor behavior.",Psychology

Abschließend wird ein Ausblick gegeben, welche weiteren Themen, die mit dem kulturresponsiven Unterrichten verbunden sind, im Lehramtsstudium zukünftig stärker berücksichtigt werden sollten.",Psychology
1166,,"Well-being is a widely used concept to characterize differences in how well students are feeling and doing. Yet, numerous conceptualizations of well-being exist, which hampers conceptual and empirical research on student well-being, and the development of measurement instruments of and interventions on well-being. To advance research and practice, we propose a definition and conceptual framework of student well-being that may serve as a basis for measuring, understanding, and promoting students’ well-being. We formulated four guiding postulates based on philosophical underpinnings of established perspectives on well-being that guided the development of our definition and framework, which was further shaped by existing literature and the input from meetings with experts. We define student well-being as a multi-facetted concept that reflects a students' degree of positive or negative cognitive appraisal about and affective experience with the self. Student well-being comprises seven interrelated facets (i.e., meaning in life, self-esteem, autonomy, relatedness, sense of belonging, subjective health, body acceptance) grouped into three domains: psychological, social, and physical. The conceptual framework outlines predictors and outcomes of student well-being. We discuss implications of our definition and framework for science and practice, as well as outline several key avenues for future research on student well-being.",Psychology
1167,,"Psychedelics are hallucinogenic drugs that have the potential to treat depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and other psychiatric conditions. The dominant paradigm in contemporary psychedelic-assisted therapy is non-directive; that is, participants undergo the psychedelic treatment with minimal external guidance from therapists. However, the clinical outcomes of psychedelic therapy could be improved by explicitly guiding participants to attend to and resolve specific symptoms of their condition. Here, we propose a variant of Daoist meditation – the outer dissolving technique in the water method – as one such framework for guiding participants in psychedelic therapy. This technique can aid participants in noticing and letting go of bodily tensions or “blockages” that are associated with repressed emotions. Practicing this technique during the preparatory and integration phases of psychedelic therapy, as well as during the acute effects of the drug, could foster deeper insights into the somatic manifestations of psychiatric conditions, while also empowering participants to release the emotions that underlie those conditions. Overall, Daoist meditation is a promising technique to facilitate psychological healing, and we encourage future researchers to consider implementing it as an adjunct to psychedelic-assisted therapy.",Psychology
1168,,"Il narcisismo maligno è un tema frequentemente discusso in ambito relazionale, ma raramente viene considerato all'interno delle dinamiche familiari. Questo articolo si propone di colmare tale lacuna, approfondendo l'impatto devastante che il narcisismo maligno può avere sui genitori vittime di un figlio narcisista. Attraverso una combinazione di prospettive teoriche, neuroscientifiche e pratiche, il testo esplora come riconoscere i segnali distintivi del narcisismo maligno, le modalità subdole di manipolazione utilizzate dai figli narcisisti e le implicazioni psicologiche per i genitori, tra cui la dipendenza emotiva, la riduzione dell'autostima e l'isolamento sociale.
Viene inoltre presentata una distinzione fondamentale tra narcisismo sano e patologico, sottolineando il valore evolutivo di una sana autostima e fiducia in sé stessi, in contrasto con i comportamenti distruttivi che caratterizzano il narcisismo maligno. Sono analizzati i meccanismi neurali, come il sistema dopaminergico e la corteccia prefrontale, coinvolti nelle dinamiche di manipolazione e condizionamento operante, evidenziando l'impatto sul benessere psicologico e relazionale.
Infine, l'articolo propone strategie per interrompere il ciclo di tossicità, con un focus sulla prevenzione precoce e l'intervento tempestivo, promuovendo relazioni familiari più equilibrate e responsabili. Attraverso una trattazione chiara e scientifica, l’obiettivo è fornire strumenti utili non solo per il genitore vittima, ma anche per prevenire che il figlio perpetui schemi comportamentali distruttivi in altre relazioni future.",Psychology
1169,,"In this study a method for detecting level stationarity in time series data based on recursive partitioning (regression trees) is examined. Recursive partitioning iteratively splits the time series into two segments with the goal of finding the most optimal difference between segment means, given certain criteria related to the length of the segments and the magnitude of the level differences. The performance of the method to recover the true transition points and the true stationary levels in simulated time series data is evaluated in terms of sensitivity analyses for different parameter settings. The performance is compared to a change point detection algorithm based on Binary Segmentation. The results show the recursive partitioning method, with an additional post-analysis adjustment which removes likely false positives, performs equally well as the change point analysis in detecting the true transition time. The recursive partitioning method appears to perform better when the estimation of the true stationary level is concerned.",Psychology
1170,,"Previous research suggests that emotion recognition ability varies within and between individuals, potentially influenced by person-related factors such as levels of sex hormones. Studies have examined links between the menstrual cycle, ovarian hormone levels, and emotion recognition, but findings are inconsistent. Some report changes across the menstrual cycle or with hormone fluctuations, while others find no significant effects. To evaluate the evidentiary value of these studies, we conducted a p-curve analysis on eight studies reporting significant associations. Two analyses were performed: one on the menstrual cycle's effects and another on combined menstrual cycle and ovarian hormone effects. Neither analysis provided clear evidence for a genuine effect, and both revealed very low statistical power (maximum 12%) in the underlying studies. Recent, more rigorous studies with larger sample sizes have also failed to detect this effect, further questioning its existence. If present, the effect is likely very small or non-existent. We recommend that future research employ high statistical power and rigorous methodologies to reliably detect any true effects.",Psychology
1171,,"Intellectual humility is increasingly recognized as an epistemic virtue that helps foster truth-seeking, encourage compromise, and mitigate polarization. Yet, the current body of evidence grapples with a striking contradiction: The prevailing theoretical account suggests that intellectual humility hinges on metacognitive ability—the capacity to introspect on one’s own accuracy which manifests in assigning due confidence to the varying accuracy of one’s accuracy. However, empirical research testing this metacognitive ability account of intellectual humility has yielded inconsistent results. Here, we introduce a cognitive science approach informed by Signal Detection Theory, allowing for a more nuanced separation of metacognitive ability from correlated but distinct concepts (i.e., confidence and accuracy). We conduct a survey study among a national US sample (N = 999) involving the interpretation of one of the most heavily contested domains—climate change—lending itself for an investigation into how intellectual humility relates to cognitive processes in domains where it is most needed. We presented participants with summaries of fictitious studies on renewable energy, followed by 2-alternative forced choice questions to assess their accuracy and confidence. Results showed that firstly, more intellectually humble citizens were more accurate at discerning correct from incorrect interpretations of the presented evidence. Secondly, more intellectually humble citizens exhibited a heightened capacity to adjust their confidence levels to the varying accuracy of their evidence interpretations–indicating higher metacognitive ability—and this association was robust to accounting for their superior accuracy, and other preregistered covariates. And thirdly, in contrast to intuitive notions, more intellectually humble citizens did not exhibit lower metacognitive bias, the inclination to report lower (vs. higher) overall confidence. By highlighting the role of metacognitive ability in intellectual humility, the current study delivers empirical evidence for the ancient notion that epistemic virtues are linked to metacognitive ability.",Psychology
1172,,"This study examined how Thai children (aged 4, 6, and 8 years) and adults discriminate Thai lexical tones with a focus on the development of perceptual asymmetries. Four Thai tones, two static (low, high) and two dynamic (rising, falling) were presented in AX pairs in two orders: static-dynamic – low-rising, low-falling, high-rising, high-falling, and dynamic-static – rising-low, falling-low, rising-high, falling-high. A significant age effect was found; tone discrimination developed monotonically over age. Independent of this age effect it was found that discrimination was significantly better for dynamic-static than for static-dynamic tone pairs. Thus, there is a definite directional asymmetry in the perception of Thai lexical tones by Thai listeners, and given the consistency of this effect across age, it appears that this directional asymmetry may be formed in early childhood, even perhaps in early infancy, or is even rooted in a general auditory bias in speech perception.",Psychology
1173,,"How do children learn words so rapidly? A powerful source of information about a new word’s meaning is the set of social cues provided by its speaker (e.g. eye-gaze). Studies of children’s use of social cues have tended to focus on the emergence of this ability in early infancy. We show, however, that this early-emerging ability has a long developmental trajectory: Slow, continuous improvements in speed of social information processing occur over the course of the first five years of life. This developing ability to allocate social attention is a significant bottleneck on early word learning—continuous changes in social information processing predict continuous changes in children’s ability to learn new words. Further, we show that this bottleneck generalizes to children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, whose social information processing is atypical. These results describe a route by which increases in social expertise can lead to changes in language learning ability, and more generally highlight the dependence of developmental outcomes not on just the existence of particular competencies, but on their proficient use in complex contexts.",Psychology
1174,,"How do children acquire the sounds, words, and structures of their native language? A
wealth of recent evidence suggests that probabilistic learning mechanisms play a role in
language acquisition. Nevertheless, the structure of these mechanisms is controversial and
it is still unknown how broadly they apply to the tasks faced by language learners.
Computational models can serve as formal theories of probabilistic learning by
instantiating proposals about the learning mechanisms available in early language
acquisition. However, fulfilling this promise requires that models be evaluated on two
grounds: their suﬃciency—whether they are able to learn aspects of language given
appropriate input—and their fidelity—whether they fit the patterns of success and failure
shown by human learners. I review experimental and computational evidence for the
application of probabilistic learning across a range of acquisition tasks and argue that
models of probabilistic learning succeed when they use expressive representations to
capture complex regularities in the input and when they implement a parsimony bias.",Psychology
1175,,"People often feel averse to performing harmful actions; yet, some medical professionals, such as surgeons, regularly perform harmful actions aimed at improving patient wellbeing. Such actions parallel sacrificial dilemmas where harm saves lives, violating deontological ethics against harm but upholding utilitarian ethics to maximize outcomes. Therefore, we predicted that, compared to other medical professionals, surgeons and physicians performing invasive procedures may reject sacrificial harm less, focus on outcomes more, or both--in part due to a lower score on empathy, personal distress and higher score on resilience and lower score on action and outcome aversion. We recruited 131 practicing physicians and compared those who a) regularly perform invasive versus noninvasive procedures and b) specialize in surgery versus other specializations on sacrificial moral dilemma decisions, empathy, personal distress, and resilience, and aversion to causing and witnessing harm. Results indicated that physicians performing invasive procedures and specializing in surgery (versus physicians not performing invasive procedures and surgeries) scored lower on both deontological and utilitarian responding; in addition, surgeons scored lower on personal distress and higher on resilience (however other findings were not significant). These findings provide some tentative evidence that surgeons and physicians performing invasive surgery are less concerned with harm than other medical professionals, which may be adaptive for performing their duties.",Psychology
1176,,"When a system observes a visual signal under uncertainty, it weights a number of values probabilistically, where the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of the distribution corresponds to the best guess of the system regarding the true value of the observed stimulus. Perceptual uncertainty can therefore be assessed as the amount of variability in a Gaussian observation which is logically expected to increase in density as a function of time (number of exposures) and stimulus intensity (Norwich, 1977), thereby making the stimulus representation more accurate. Similar to how noise is modeled in stimulus representations during memory tasks, the amount of uncertainty in the observation can also simultaneously depend on whether the stimulus is perceived as a target or a distractor in a psychophysical task. We show that a framework incorporating both sources of noise can explain priming effects where the interference between two signals in a trial is given by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence of their observations, with the initial stimulus treated as a reference distribution. Our model predicted response times in a perceptual shape discrimination task including items embedded in spatial noise that could unpredictably appear as a target or as a distractor. These results show that processing times of the second stimulus can be convincingly modeled as the statistical distance between the noise distributions of two consecutive stimuli.",Psychology
1177,,"Registered Reports are a type of empirical article in which study proposals are peer reviewed and pre-accepted before the research is undertaken. This is achieved by splitting the traditional peer review process into two stages: at ‘Stage 1’, authors submit their study proposal and peer reviewers assess the plausibility of the research questions and the appropriateness of the methodology and analytical plan. Protocols that are favourably reviewed receive ‘In Principle Acceptance’ (IPA) whereby the journal, or platform, commits to publishing the final study regardless of its results. The authors then collect and/or analyse their data. At ‘Stage 2’, they then submit their complete research article and peer reviewers evaluate how closely the authors have followed their protocol and accurately report and interpret their findings. By doing this, Registered Reports are proposed to mitigate many issues seen in the historical research ecosystem: they aim to reduce the potential for questionable research practices by incentivising transparency and reproducibility and reduce publication bias by focusing on methodological and analytical rigour over the nature of the results. This guide provides an overview of what Registered Reports are and how they work, responds to frequently asked questions, outlines barriers and solutions to their implementation, and offers 10 top tips for researchers. It is aimed at students and researchers wanting to learn more about Registered Reports and/or conduct their research through this format.",Psychology
1178,,"Underrepresented racially and ethnically minoritized (URM) students contend with individual-level race-based stressors in college, like racialized discrimination and microaggressions. In this study, we consider whether URM students’ perceptions of racial inequity on campus—a context-level race-based stressor—trigger adverse psychological and physical stress responses that, in turn, undermine academic achievement. Using a sample of 781 science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) students, we found in a longitudinal study that URM students report perceiving more inequality on campus compared to White and Asian students. Greater perceived inequality was, in turn, associated with increased psychological and physical stress responses, which, in some cases, predicted lower grades. Promoting more equitable college environments, therefore, may help attenuate inequalities in stress responses, ultimately, enhancing academic achievement.",Psychology
1179,,"The transition out of upper secondary education represents a critical life event for young adults. Research on trajectories of affective well-being during this period is limited and inconsistent. The present work investigated changes in well-being from shortly before graduating from upper secondary education to approximately one year later. The motivation for a post-school pathway, as well as perceptions of the impact of moving out of home, ending a relationship, and entering a new relationship were examined as potential predictors of between-person differences in well-being trajectories. German-speaking high school graduates (N = 897) reported on their affective well-being in up to four surveys over approximately one year and additionally indicated their motivation for their post-school pathway and life events they had experienced. At three measurement occasions, participants also participated in a three-week experience sampling phase, in which they reported on their daily well-being. Latent change models revealed an initial increase in well-being after graduation, but mixed evidence for subsequent trajectories, as both positive and negative affect decreased on average. Changes in well-being were more pronounced for global assessments of affective well-being. We did not find associations of the motivation for a post-school pathway and the life events with well-being trajectories. Overall, these findings highlight the complexity of well-being trajectories during the transition out of upper secondary education and the importance of using multiple time points and assessment methods to understand these dynamics.

Specifically, low socioeconomic status (SES) negatively impacts children's intelligence quotient (IQ). Most data on this topic comes from high-inequality countries such as the United States. Here, we investigate the impact of SES on IQ and attention and how it might be mediated by early-childhood factors in 10- to 13-year-old children in Poland, a country with relatively low socioeconomic differences and medium incomes. Inhibitory attention was measured using a go/no-go task. We found that parental education significantly influenced IQ and attention. Low SES children scored on average 3 IQ points lower than high SES children and had significantly longer reaction times and d’ (discrimination accuracies). Family SES had a clear non-mediated impact on IQ, and an overall effect on attention. On the other hand, smoking/alcohol during pregnancy,  and breastfeeding, while all correlated with SES, did not modify its effects on IQ or attention. We conclude that the impact of SES on cognition is considerable even in a low-inequality country such as Poland, and in our population it cannot be explained by these early-life factors.",Psychology
1181,,"This meta-analysis synthesizes research on longitudinal associations between child and adolescent peer adversity and various domains of adult interpersonal functioning. Meta-analyses were conducted on 220 effect sizes from 37 studies published between 1998 and 2024, unadjusted and adjusted for gender, socioeconomic status and childhood family adversity. Participants (Ntotal = 45,325, proportion of girls = 54.6%, average duration to follow-up = 11.5 years) in the 27 samples were primarily European or North American (k = 26). Peer adversity was linked to adult interpersonal functioning in unadjusted (r = -.15) and adjusted models (r = -.15), no robust moderators were found. These findings highlight the importance of mitigating a broad range of peer adversity to foster relational health in adulthood.",Psychology
1182,,"Expression recognition abilities are key to navigating our social world. Accordingly, understanding how expression recognition is associated with individual differences in other abilities linked with positive life outcomes, such as empathy and general cognitive ability, is a topic of considerable public and scientific interest. However, most studies investigating such questions used face images that show prototypically posed expressions, which lack the nuance and variation of real-life expressions. Here, we introduce a new task for assessing naturalistic expression recognition ability, modeled after an established posed expression labeling task. We investigated whether naturalistic and posed recognition show similar associations with empathy and cognitive ability despite differences in the realism and perceived genuineness of the expressions. Across three studies, we found that the naturalistic task, which was highly correlated with the posed task, possessed strong psychometric properties that make it well suited to studying individual differences. While naturalistic and posed recognition had similarly sized, positive associations with cognitive and affective empathy, naturalistic recognition had a greater positive association with cognitive ability than did posed recognition. Overall, our results show that naturalistic expressions—which are more nuanced and varied than posed expressions—can provide equally, if not more, robust insights into expression recognition ability.",Psychology
1183,,"Systematic Title-Abstract  (TA) screening is an essential but time-intensive task, especially in large-scale collaborations working with large datasets. We introduce the Screenathon Review, a literature screening procedure that adapts to this setting by 1. crowdsourcing the screening using relevant stakeholders, 2. screening literature in a limited amount of time, 3. forming a consensus about inclusion criteria and definitions and 4. building a research community that lasts for the entire project's duration. The procedure involves four phases: Large-scale screening preparation, group calibration and training, crowd-sourced screening, and quality checking. We applied and tested this procedure with 26 attendees as part of the EU-funded IMPROVE project in a four-day design, which included incentives and gamification elements. During the screening phase of the Screenathon event, 12,473 records were screened within two days. Attendees’ confidence, motivation, and satisfaction were high and did not decrease during screening days. Considerations about the procedure and implications for future Screenathon Reviews are discussed.",Psychology
1184,,"Purpose: The autistic-developed monotropism account suggests autism is characterized by hyper-focus towards interests, although hyper-focus research has not explored associations among self-/caregiver-report and lab-based measures.  Other findings suggest autistic attention has an enhanced capacity and/or is unusually prone to involuntary capture.  This study used questionnaires and lab-based tasks to investigate autistic attention and probe its relations to inattention/distractibility, sensory experiences, and anxiety.
Methods: 18 autistic and 22 comparison adolescents completed self-report measures of hyper-focus, anxiety, and sensory experiences, and laboratory psychoacoustic tasks, visual working memory and cross-modal attention capture accuracy and reaction time tasks, and a hyper-focus paradigm relying on the N2pc and Pd event-related potentials.  Participants’ caregivers completed proxy hyper-focus, anxiety, sensory experiences, and inattention questionnaires.
Results: Autistic participants had elevated hyper-focus per self- and caregiver-report questionnaires, and exhibited less visual working memory capacity, potentially reflecting difficulty attending to multiple targets.  However, groups did not differ in event-related potentials indexing hyper-focus, or behavioural cross-modal attention capture.  Different types of attention measures were generally not related to one another.  Participants and their caregivers  overall viewed hyper-focus’ impact as modestly positive, with individual opinions differing.  Self-reported hyper-focus was related to self-reported misophonia and sensory hyperreactivity.
Conclusions: Questionnaires suggest hyper-focus is elevated in autism and has mixed, nuanced real-world impacts.  However, some laboratory paradigms with explicit instructions in highly controlled, often non-naturalistic environments may struggle capture real-world autistic attentional experiences; additional research is needed to align laboratory and questionnaire measures.  This study also suggests autistic perceptual capacities are not globally enhanced.",Psychology
1185,,"Early vocabulary development benefits from diverse lexical exposures within children’s language environment. However, the influence of lexical diversity on children as they enter middle childhood and are exposed to multimodal language inputs remains unclear. This study evaluates global and local aspects of lexical diversity in three 1.6-million-word child-directed corpora, representing average Chinese children’s speech, print and media language environments. Additionally, pseudo-multimodal samples were compiled from the three corpora to compare with the unimodal environments on lexical diversity. We then investigated the associations between lexical diversity and the acquisition of 361 words spanning early-to-middle childhood. The findings show that print and pseudo-multimodal language provided the most diverse lexical environments, whereas speech exhibited the least diversity. However, speech diversity most strongly predicted lexical development, particularly before the onset of middle childhood. Exploratory analysis revealed that lexical diversity of other modalities emerged as stronger predictors thereafter. Early lexical development was best predicted by words’ variations in connectivity with other words within an immediate context, whereas in middle childhood, variations in words’ occurrences in larger context windows became the primary predictor, implicating children’s growing ability to attend to linguistic contexts of increasing sizes. Importantly, higher diversity was consistently associated with earlier word acquisition across measures and developmental phases. These findings underscore the critical role of varied lexical experiences in children’s language development.",Psychology
1186,,"Learning diagnosis plays a vital role in effective education, with formative assessments shown to significantly enhance academic performance. Diagnostic classification models have been developed to assess students’ learning status and provide remedial instructions. However, the impact of mastery or non-mastery of specific attributes on long-term learning development remains uncertain. If certain non-mastered attributes hinder the growth of mathematical ability, early intervention becomes essential. In this study, we developed a random effect diagnostic classification for multilevel growth curve (RDC-MGC) model to identify the specific effects of attribute mastery on the individual-level mathematics ability growth. The model was applied to arithmetic test data from second- to sixth-grade elementary students. Diagnosis was conducted in the second grade, and the effects of mastery on mathematics ability growth from the third to sixth grades were assessed. The results showed that attribute mastery in the second grade influenced both the intercept and slope of individual ability growth, highlighting the importance of early-stage diagnosis in supporting mathematical development. Potential extensions of the proposed RDC-MGC model are also discussed.",Psychology
1187,,"Operational C2 systems, as realised in military headquarters, will involve in the future a far greater diversity of knowledge domain specialists than the traditional paradigm, expanding to encompass experts in warfare and manoeuvre across non-traditional domains, emerging digital technologies, and multi-agency linkages as demanded by the increasing complexity of the cooperation-competition-conflict environment. The integration of these elements will be critical to enable timely and accurate awareness and decision making to meet the challenges and threats of an increasingly complex geopolitical landscape in which military force is but one element of national power.
The integration of these specialists is not without its challenges, including problems with cross-domain communication, role ambiguity and team orientation. Generalists, individuals with a broader gambit of knowledge but less depth than specialists, are frequently touted as the solution to multi-disciplinary teams. Generalists alone however lack the domain expertise to complete the same depth of tasks as specialists. Organisational theory provides a plethora of literature examining the specialist/generalist composition of an organisation, which is known as the specialist vs generalist dilemma.
This paper will draw upon this body of research to build on the design of a 5th Generation Headquarters, a concept previously presented in ICCRTS. Included will be a model that enriches the binary conceptualisation of generalism v specialism, to explore the broad spectrum of knowledge heterogeneity and depth. Changes in structure, staff training, and automation/autonomous technologies are discussed as possible parameters that may be modified to enhance organisational effectiveness and agility.",Psychology

In this paper we conducted Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) on two new multi-item measures implemented within the 2022 MURA Snapshot survey: a four item measure of Culture and seven item measure of Command and Control (C2) Agility. We found good fit indices for a reduced three item measure of Culture, and for the full seven item measure of C2 Agility. We believe this is the first published and validated measure of C2 Agility, and therefore offers a useful and rigorous tool for the C2 community. We conclude the paper by providing a discussion of possible directions for future research including approaches for making improvements to each scale.",Psychology
1189,,"Much research has focused on identifying the qualities and conditions of music that evoke the sensation of “groove”— the pleasurable human urge to move in time to music. However, aside from this and a prior companion study, no investigations have explored the potential groove effect of simple metronome meter-rhythms on repetitive physical activities, including that of walking. Additionally, while a few studies have examined the effect of music sound intensity during walking, auditory stimuli have not been compared with the silent walking condition at equivalent cadence. In Shay (2023a), a range of “basic meters” varying in monotonicity and complexity were created using an accenting metronome, that placed a different tonal accent on the first beat of each repeating measure created. Quadruple meter with a corresponding 4/4 time signature elicited the longest synchronous step lengths and proportionately fastest walking speeds. Additionally, the stimulation of music a metronome was found to increase linearly with increasing sound intensity (Shay, 2022b). With the same participant and test track at a confirmed synchronous walking tempo of 120 bpm, the current investigation aimed to validate and expand upon previous findings by introducing another level of metronome meter complexity (basic quadruple meter with secondary third-beat accenting) in an integrated design across a wider range of sound intensity — 59 dB (faint) to 87 dB (moderately loud). The order of increasing participant vigor elicited by the four stimulus conditions studied was: nearly monotonic basic 10/4 metronome meter &lt; basic 4/4 metronome meter &lt; secondary accented 4/4 metronome meter &lt; familiar–enjoyable 4/4 single-genre music. This sequence represents the order of decreasing meter monotonicity and increasing meter-rhythm complexity overall. Over the intensity range studied, walking speed increased similarly (approximately 11%) with increasing intensity for all stimuli, suggesting that intensity serves as a modulator of the auditory stimulus.  At higher intensities, all conditions of music and metronome meter produced more walking speed than the 120 spm silent walking condition. These results align with prior findings, demonstrating that at equivalent sound intensities and synchronous walking tempos, reducing the monotonicity of the meter or increasing the complexity of the meter-rhythm progressively enhances sensorimotor stimulation. Furthermore, sound intensity modulates the level of the stimulus vigor produced.  These findings have practical implications for walkers, runners, and other repetitive exercise and sports domain activities. Additionally, they provide insights into the auditory coupling with the human motor system and may hold potential for applications in cued-rehabilitation of human gait disorders.",Psychology
1190,,"Objective: Feelings of shame can play a role in the development and maintenance of mental disorders. However, the role and measurement of shame in relation to eating disorders remain poorly understood. The current work presents the adaptation of a measure of external and internal shame in relation to eating disorders (EISS-ED) based on an integrative perspective that leverages the strengths of the biopsychosocial model and shame-pride cycle framework. Specifically, the EISS-ED accounts for how individuals believe they are perceived by others (external shame) and how they perceive themselves (internal shame), in relation to eating. Method: The study used exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses to examine the factor structure and psychometric properties of the EISS-ED (N = 478). Spearman’s correlations and Receiving Operator Characteristic curves were used for validity testing. Results: The results supported the two-factor structure (including 14 items) of the EISS-ED and its factorial invariance by clinical history and gender. Concurrent validity analyses showed positive correlations between external and internal shame and eating disorder symptoms, negative affect, and detachment. Both external and internal shame measures provided fair classification accuracy of participants based on self-reported history of clinical assessment or treatment for eating disorders. Discussion: These findings improve the understanding of the role of shame in eating disorders and offer evidence on a valid assessment that can aid in identifying, measuring, and addressing this important construct, supporting targeted interventions.",Psychology
1191,,"Evidence supporting the influential mentalizing account of autism (that autistic people struggle to spontaneously represent others’ beliefs) has traditionally required autistic people to mentalize about non-autistic people. Yet, we know that individuals mentalize better for people who are like them and autistic people are likely to see non-autistic people as different to themselves. Here, we tested whether an actor’s diagnosis affected the spontaneous mentalizing of autistic and non-autistic adults by recording eye-movements. We found that autistic adults correctly anticipated the actor’s action based on her beliefs only when she was autistic. Conversely, non-autistic adults correctly anticipated her action only when the actor was non-autistic. Thus, the predominantly non-autistic world we inhabit seems to underlie autistic people’s difficulty mentalizing, challenging the idea of a fundamental impairment.",Psychology
1192,,"Metacognitive monitoring plays a central role in models focusing either on monitoring strategies (models of self-regulated learning) or on monitoring judgments and their accuracy (models of metacognition). Although strategies and judgments are both concerned with monitoring one’s learning progress, they have been analyzed only independently, so far. To combine these two research perspectives, an integrative model is proposed. Two studies empirically tested the structure of metacognitive monitoring and investigated the influence of metacognitive knowledge and motivational components. The studies focused on general (Study 1, N = 396) and situation-specific (Study 2, N = 225) monitoring as well as on quantitative and qualitative aspects of monitoring (both studies). Across the two studies, monitoring one’s own learning was characterized by three separate but correlated factors: use of monitoring strategies, quality of monitoring strategies, and accuracy of monitoring judgments. Furthermore, common (metacognitive knowledge, expectancy) and specific (value) predictors of metacognitive monitoring were identified.",Psychology
1193,,"It has been argued that small effects observed at a single instance should not be dismissed, because they can be expected to accumulate in the long term. This follows a classic argument by Abelson (1985). However, it has also been argued that such long-term accumulation is entirely speculative, and need not happen. Here this is shown with a simple mathematical formulation. This formulation shows that the Abelson example is in fact maximally biased towards effects accumulating, in a way that real psychological effects are unlikely to ever fulfill. Even small deviations can have large consequences for the long-term effects. Further, it is shown how under simple conditions, long-term effects may be smaller than those observed at a single timepoint. If the theoretical value of an effect lies in the long term, that effect should therefore be examined in the long term, rather than merely speculated about in the short term.",Psychology

The 120 participating male youth completed three questionnaires (baseline, post-test, 3-month follow-up; 77.5% retention). A subsample of 14 male youth and five trainers were interviewed pre- and post-program. With these multi-method, multi-informant data, we evaluated program effectiveness on the six intended outcomes (attitudes (primary outcome), global self-esteem, skills, knowledge, SDV use and victimization, and sexual risk behavior) by 1) statistically comparing self-reports between the intervention and control groups; 2) thematically analyzing interview data. We found limitations in program integrity, and mixed evidence for program effectiveness on attitudes, knowledge, skills, SDV use and sexual risk behavior, and no evidence for effectiveness on global self-esteem or SDV victimization. We also found indications of adverse effects on SDV use and victimization. We offer suggestions for program refinement and future program evaluations.",Psychology

This study employed a quantitative experimental approach with a mixed-method design to measure the effects of counterfactual thinking on the decision-making ability of early adult females with anxiety using the modified Iowa Gambling Task (IGT). Based on the screening stages using the DASS-42, 40 participants with moderate and severe levels of anxiety met the inclusion criteria. The findings of this study indicate that counterfactual thinking, particularly the upward type, impacts one’s capacity for better decision-making.",Psychology

health care teams in Greece, were referred via a novel Arts on Prescription scheme. 
Participants were randomised either to a group-based art intervention (art+CAU) in the form of 
regular activities involving theatre, cinema, photography, museum visits, or music events, or a

Outcomes: At 12 weeks, 156 and 155 for art + CAU and CAU respectively completed the trial. In 
linear mixed effects models (n = 373 participants), art + CAU led to greater decreases in 
depression (estimated marginal mean, EMM -1.63, 95%CI -2.81 to -0.45), anxiety (EMM -1.62,

1199,,"Background: Healthcare professionals seldom receive training on neurodevelopmental conditions such as ADHD. An online training was co-developed to address some of the gaps in knowledge and understanding in primary care. A randomised control trial demonstrated that the training increased knowledge and confidence and improved practice.
Objectives: This report highlights the implementation of the training in practice and follow-up 4 years post-evaluation.
Methods: The online ADHD training comprises two modules: ""Understanding ADHD"" and ""The Role of the GP in the Care Pathway,"" each taking approximately 45 minutes to complete. The training targets general practitioners primarily but is open to other healthcare professionals and parents. Feedback was collected through a survey at the end of the training, and the training has been widely adopted by various organisations internationally and nationally. 
Implementation Results: Between December 2019 and January 2024, the ""Understanding ADHD"" module was accessed over 13,486 times, while the ""Role of the GP"" module was accessed 7,018 times, primarily by users from the US and UK. Survey results from both modules showed positive feedback with high ratings for usefulness, likelihood to inform practice, and recommendation to colleagues. Some suggestions for improvement included reducing the negative focus on ADHD consequences and incorporating more positive aspects of ADHD. 
Conclusions: This ADHD online training program, despite facing implementation challenges, has seen positive outcomes, including international translation and high user ratings. Suggestions for improvement were received, but some were not feasible due to regional variations in ADHD pathways. The training's impact extended beyond GPs to other healthcare professionals, though the COVID-19 pandemic posed obstacles to dissemination efforts. Nonetheless, ongoing plans aim to expand the training's implementation globally.",Psychology
1200,,"One of the most highly debated issues in psycholinguistics during the last decades is the so-called bilingual cognitive advantage (BICA), i.e. the hypothesis that people with a bilingual experience outperform monolingual speakers on cognitive tasks, presumably attributed to strengthened executive functions. This debate is nowadays deadlocked, as contradictory findings continue to accumulate. Unfortunately, despite attempts to find explanations in the diversity of bilingual experiences as a potential source of individual variability and the questioning of the reliability of executive function tests used to measure BICA, the status quo is maintained and new research perspectives are strongly needed, possibly outside the realm of psycholinguistics. We consider bilingual experience as deeply anchored in social context and argue that any conclusion drawn from traditional paradigms assessing cognition in socially isolated subjects would be hazardous. In an era of increasing influence of concepts such as the social brain, studies of bilingualism have seldom taken into account the social nature of human interaction via language. Recent studies, however, suggest that even minimal components of social context, such as mere presence of others, with no overt interaction or communication, modulate BICA in a complex and dynamic manner, in interaction with other factors including linguistic context and gender. We will focus on attention as a common mechanism that accounts for both bilingual language processing and the monitoring of social presence. Bringing together psycholinguistics and social psychology perspectives, this review calls for a move towards a socially embedded approach of bilingualism, with an integrated view of executive attention.",Sociology

1202,,"Although still debated, the relationship between paid and unpaid work is crucial for uncovering a potential determinant of persisting gender inequality. Reductions in paid work and their consequences for the gendered performance of unpaid work have the potential to shed light on this relationship. However, there is still no clear answer to the question of whether and how reductions in paid work (including reductions in working hours, job losses, and retirement) affect the amount of time spent on unpaid work by gender, and what factors explain the variation in existing studies. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the existing literature on the topic. We analyzed 198 unique estimates of the effect of reductions in paid work on time spent on housework and care work in different-sex couples. Our findings indicate that both men and women respond to reductions in paid work by increasing the time they spend on unpaid work. Although the effect is stronger for men than for women, it is small and quite heterogeneous across studies. Therefore, it is insufficient to reduce gender inequality in the division of unpaid work.",Sociology

posthumanism can also be seen as a continuum to humanism, providing a more consistent

We examine public evaluations about preferred punishment and fair treatment using vignette experiments that randomize multiple features of police-civilian interactions. These causal estimates reveal that for the mass public, officer race generally does not affect public attitudes, while participant demeanor, markers of threat, and civilian race do. Police-civilian interactions are evaluated through a lens of reciprocity: hostile officers are judged as less fair, while hostile and armed civilians are viewed as deserving of harsher punishment. When civilians remain polite and threat is low, there is little support for punitive outcomes, but poor civilian behavior warrants more punitive state action. Moreover, people prefer more punishment for White compared to Black civilians, and in interactions with White officers and civilians compared to those in which both parties are Black. Interactions with a White officer and a Black civilian are judged as less fair, as are the fairness of assigned punishments in them.

Using qualitative content analysis of Faktabaari's Digital Information Literacy Guide, we explore its discussion of mis- and disinformation issues and impact, its construction for digital information literacy, and the role of NGOs in enhancing digital information literacy. Findings reveal Faktabaari’s emphasis on practical approaches to information evaluation, digital competence, and the societal impact of disinformation, highlighting its contributions to knowledge dissemination and advocacy. However, it lacks attention to generative artificial intelligence (AI) challenges and a structured conceptual framework for digital literacy. This research underscores the value of NGO-led efforts in enhancing public digital literacy and civic engagement, offering insights into their potential to address disinformation challenges beyond national borders.",Sociology

1212,,"Background and Objectives: As life expectancy has increased, there has been political pressure to raise the age for retirement benefit claims. Paid sick leave (PSL) may support older workers in maintaining employment intensity by offering workers the flexibility to address health and caregiving needs. However, little is known about the role of PSL access on older workers' employment and income.

Research Design and Methods: The study uses data from the 2010-2018 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), accessed via IPUMS. Stratified multivariate regression models controlling for demographic and employment characteristics are used to explore the association between access to PSL and employment intensity among older workers.

Results: Among workers older than age 62, access to PSL is associated with a 28% higher likelihood of working full-time (p&lt;0.001) and an average of 7.3 (18.8%) more hours per week (p&lt;0.001). The strongest associations between access to paid sick leave and employment intensity are observed among female workers and those with educational attainment beyond a high school degree, and weakest among Latinx workers.

Discussion and Implications: PSL access is associated with greater employment intensity as workers age, with implications for economic security given the significant increase in hours worked per week. Public policy requiring employers to provide PSL may reduce disparities in access and support the employment of older workers.

1213,,"A family is a network of individuals tied to each other by blood, marriage, adoption or fostering and comes in many forms and sizes. There is no singular or universal type of family. Some common family types or structures include a single parent and children, a ‘nuclear’ family comprising two parents and children, or extended families consisting of one or two parents, children and other relatives. However, a range of different family types exist within this spectrum. A household is a commonly used term or unit of analysis to describe a group of people’s living arrangements and relationships to each other. What comprises a household can vary across cultures, social contexts and even seasons. While family and households are often conflated in the literature, in reality they are different. Families refer to specific kinship structures, whereas not all members of a household are necessarily kin but instead are tied to each other through co-residence and roles and responsibilities around the production and consumption of food and labour. One key reason we see so much variation in families and households is because people usually tend to live with other people - although, of course, living alone is also a type of household. Thus, family and household size, structure and composition can vary for multiple reasons across cultures including the number of children a parent/couple have, child and adult survival rates, the types of marriage which form the family and the post-marital residence systems which influence the generational configuration of households. This chapter underlines how flexible and context-specific human family systems are, and how the vast diversity present in humans leads to endless types of families and households.",Sociology

1216,,"In the novel Torto Arado, various aspects of the daily life of a family living in the poverty of the Bahia backlands are addressed. They survive through work akin to slavery, and their social roles are strongly tied to race, class, and gender. This study provides an observational literary analysis of the female figure and her constant submission and suffering, based on the relationship between Belonisia and Tobias. In the narrative, each of the sisters assumes an identity: while Bibiana represents resistance and social transformation, Belonia represents female submission in a patriarchal society, in discriminatory and unromantic gender relationships, as was the case with their ancestors. The analysis results showed that the marriage between Belonisia and Tobias does not consider the woman's wishes from the beginning, when she is arranged to marry her husband by her father. Furthermore, throughout the relationship, she suffers various mistreatments from her husband, who constantly disqualifies and beats the girl, who is unable to free herself from this relationship due to the social expectations surrounding her marriage. Thus, it was concluded that the girl is silenced in her relationship with Tobias, both by the accident she suffered in childhood, which took away her ability to speak, and by her inability to distance herself from her husband and his aggression. Due to the girl's patriarchal education and the lack of knowledge about social rights, Belonisia lives in a context where domestic violence is normalized, and the culture of being silenced by the male figure prevails. Therefore, the analysis of the female figure in the marriage between Belonisia and Tobias is of utmost importance.",Sociology

This challenge will need to be addressed on multiple levels—from small-time producers to large multinational corporations and from local governments to international treaties—across multiple components of food production. Trust among producers, regulators, and resource managers is one of the many things that will be required to successfully transform the food system. In this qualitative study, we explore trust dynamics among aquaculture producers in the midwestern US. Based on a series of 34 interviews, we use the trust ecology framework to illustrate both how the different dimensions of trust are present among aquaculture producers and how the dimensions of trust might be threatened. Our findings emphasize the importance of building stronger interpersonal relationships between regulatory agencies and aquaculture producers. Additionally, our research shows that producers feel a need for more vocal advocacy for the industry within the regulatory system. These findings present an important case study illustrating how trust influences the relationship between producers and regulators and how building trust might allow the industry to work together to grow production and, potentially, sustainability.",Sociology

remain below what is necessary to reach official climate targets. We argue that the green turn reflects
the success and limits of political bargains that attempt to use decarbonization as a means to fortify
countries’ growth models and dominant economic interests. Such bargains have proven effective in
overcoming entrenched path dependencies, unlocking policy progress. But these bargains also entail
trade-offs that constrain the scope and goals of decarbonization. Prioritizing incumbent economic
interests can slow emission cuts, limit tools to the unpopular and ineffective, and thwart visions of a
just transition. To develop this argument empirically, we provide original quantitative estimates of
climate policies in the G20 and conduct case studies of the UK, the EU, and South Korea.",Sociology
1219,,"Background
Weight-related discrimination is widespread in society. Some US studies have suggested weight discrimination may differ between demographic groups, impacting white women more than minority women or men. However, stigma differs substantially between societies, and few studies have explored intersectional effects outside the US.
Methods
In a large (N=8,057) ethnically diverse panel study UK adults, we examined associations of body mass index (BMI) with two stigma-related outcomes in the past year: being insulted in an everyday setting and being denied a promotion or training at work. To explore intersectional effects, we examined whether sex, ethnicity, sex-ethnicity-combinations, or educational qualifications modified associations.
Results
In models adjusted for confounders including psychological distress, higher BMI was correlated with being insulted in an everyday setting across all participants (per kg/m2, OR: 1.02, CI:1.01,1.03), male (OR: 1.03, CI:1.01,1.05) and female participants (OR: 1.02, CI: 1.00,1.03). Stratifying by ethnicity and sex-ethnicity combinations, the strongest association was seen for Asian men (OR:1.04, CI: 1.01,1.07); other estimates were less precise. Among participants employed in the past year, higher BMI was significantly associated with being denied promotion or training across all participants (OR: 1.03, CI: 1.00,1.06) and women (OR: 1.04, 1.01,1.08). Stratifying by sex-ethnicity combination, the strongest association was for Black women (OR: 1.06, CI: (1.01,1.12).
Conclusions
Results are consistent with experience of weight discrimination across sexes, ethnic groups and educational levels in the UK. Longitudinal studies are needed to unravel mechanisms linking weight and discrimination in minority ethnic groups.",Sociology

According to the COVAX live (Live COVID-19 Vaccination Tracker), as of May 2022, 70.26% of the total population have been vaccinated. This is indeed an example of Bangladesh governments' astounding competence that Bangladesh is considered among the first few countries to start vaccinations. However, Bangladesh did experience occasional hiccups in steady vaccine roll-out due to disruptions in the supply chain. Experts condemned Bangladesh's diplomatic choice of relying on only India as a steady vaccine manufacturing source after India decided to temporarily halt vaccinations right before the administration of second doses. Bearing reference to the 'Neighborhood Effect' in International Politics which implies that excessive dependency on geographical neighbors can cause similar levels of instability in both the countries (neighbors), this paper examines Bangladesh's overall Diplomatic approach in its COVID-19 Vaccination program with comparison to its East Asian counterpart Mongolia. Mongolia secured high-ranking position in COVID-19 mass vaccination using its strategic partnerships to pool vaccines from multiple sources as a result of its 2011 multi-pillars Foreign Policy (Third Neighborhood Policy) approach. Using a novel computational multimodal discourse analysis using machine learning assisted techniques in two large hand-collected datasets, the paper delves into the practices implemented by Bangladesh's multi-level stakeholders from the early stages of the pandemic until January this year to find any signs of or impacts of the Neighborhood Effect in its Vaccine Diplomacy. The paper later on makes policy-level suggestions on how to resolve this in case of future health crisis with occasional mention and comparison to Mongolia's Third Neighborhood approach and its implacability in Bangladeshi context.",Sociology

This study aims to address the challenges that ethnic minorities in Bangladesh, otherwise known as Indigenous people (IP), face in their entrepreneurial ventures while remaining in the informal sector, and recommend policy initiatives to counteract those challenges. We hypothesize that the Indigenous economy’s entrepreneurial landscape mainly comprises informal entrepreneurship. Which inevitably creates barriers to accessing financial institutions, incentives and services provided by the Government of Bangladesh (GOB) and other formal institutions, necessary for Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) to scale up and maximize market development. For this study, we used 67 case studies of IP-led businesses and startups in Bangladesh, in conjunction with the Future of Business Survey Data from Facebook. We use Fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (Fs/QCA), a novel analytical method to identify complex interacting causal factors from a large body of case studies. We hope to provide a sound basis for policy interventions based on practical and perceived needs of IPs, which are required to make entrepreneurship in Bangladesh more inclusive and ensure that IPs have a level playing field in the formal economy of Bangladesh.",Sociology
1222,,"International sanctions have been an increasingly common tool for enforcing
international norms of behavior, among other goals. There is continuing debate
on what drives sanctioning behavior: while IR theories of sanctions have a long
empirical history, more recent studies identify a need to extend these theories
to better account for the endogenous nature of state sanction networks. Using a
combination of network and IR-based insights, we aim to build a theory-driven,
interpretable model of international sanctions that has high predictive utility.
Using a separable version of dynamic network logistic regression, we test network
theories of “Matthew effects,” reciprocity, and previous state-level sanctioning
activity alongside traditional IR theories regarding the democratic peace, cultural
or institutional similarity, power imbalance, and trade. Though we find that
mechanisms from established IR theories largely hold with the inclusion of network
endogeneity, endogenous network effects are more powerful than traditional
IR concepts for predictive accuracy of the sanctioning network. We also find considerable
differences for factors driving the imposition of sanctions (tie formation)
versus persistence of sanction regimes (persistence), pointing to the importance
of treating such effects separately.",Sociology
1223,,"Rising flood risks present significant threats to communities globally. This study examines the influence of risk perception and place attachment on the adoption of household adaptive behaviors in flood-prone regions of Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. The study employed latent profile analysis on data from 304 households, revealing four distinct profiles categorized by risk perception and levels of place attachment. The findings reveal that place attachment acts as an amplifier of adaptive behaviors, particularly when combined with high risk perception. Even in contexts of low risk perception, place attachment encouraged certain adaptive behaviors like insurance adoption. However, its effectiveness varied across socioeconomic contexts and types of adaptive measures, with the strongest effects observed for structural adaptation measures. The study demonstrates that combining strong place attachment with high risk perception is particularly effective in motivating costly protective actions. These findings suggest that flood risk management strategies should incorporate place-based elements alongside traditional risk communication approaches to better promote community resilience. This research contributes to understanding how such emotional connections to place can enhance flood adaptation.",Sociology

While the concept has predominantly been studied in the United States, where these deaths have increased significantly, this analysis examines its application to Italy, a country with comparatively lower DoD rates. This work aims to analyse the magnitude of these causes of death in Italy and examine both their joint and independent trends to determine whether they can be treated as a single group of causes. We employ the Potential Gain in Life Expectancy to assess the impact of these causes on overall mortality in Italy, then investigate the identified time series leveraging Cointegration Analysis. Utilizing ISTAT data from 1983 to 2018, aggregated by gender and age groups at the NUTS1 level, the study reveals a decline in DoD mortality in Italy, driven mainly by a reduction in alcohol-related deaths. The magnitude and trajectory of the analysed causes offer valuable insights into the unique dynamics of DoD in Italy and its regional variations. Cointegration Analysis indicates that there is no significant dependency structure between these causes or across regions, with only a few exceptions. These findings suggest that in Italy, DoD should not be treated as a homogeneous group, but rather as distinct outcomes of despair that require separate consideration in public health interventions.",Sociology

1226,,"There is a widespread perception that society has been polarizing into groups with increasingly divergent opinions. Multiple studies have sought to quantify the degree of opinion divergence (or ideological polarization), typically relying on variation among self-reported opinions, and have reached mixed conclusions. Each individual, however, perceives the landscape of public opinion through a subjective lens or viewpoint that is dynamically shaped by their social environment. To account for this subjectivity in perceived polarization, we propose a model of dynamic perception that takes social identity into account. When members of an in-group become increasingly homogeneous on a given topic (that is, when the variance of opinions in that group decreases), they perceive deviant opinions as increasingly distant from their own. Consequently, these individuals may perceive much more polarization than what an objective, neutral observer would perceive. We apply our model to empirical data on the opinions of German citizens about climate change and show that the effect of dynamic opinion perception on polarization can be nearly as substantial as actual opinion divergence. Moreover, we show that the direction of the effect need not be consistent over time, nor across different partisan groups. Our framework helps explain why people might sometimes experience levels of ideological polarization higher than those indicated by opinion surveys, independent of structural divisions, polarization-enforcing biases, or affect-driven attitudes towards out-groups.",Sociology
1227,,"This study examines biologists leaving science in 38 OECD countries in the past two decades. We use publication metadata from a global bibliometric database (raw Scopus data at the micro-level of individual scientists). In a cohort-based and longitudinal fashion, we follow individual men and women scientists over time, from their first to their last publication (N=86,178). We examine four academic disciplines: AGRI (agricultural and biological sciences), BIO (biochemistry, genetics, and molecular biology), IMMU (immunology and microbiology), and NEURO (neuroscience). We apply survival analysis, conceptualizing scientific life as a sequence of scholarly publishing events. Our Kaplan–Meier survival analysis shows how women disappear from science: in BIO, about 60% are still in science after 5 years, 40% after 10 years, and only 20% by the end of the period examined (i.e., after 19 years). The percentages are substantially higher for men: approximately 70%, 50%, and 30%, respectively. Kaplan–Meier estimations indicate that women in the largest discipline (BIO) are 23.26% more likely to leave science after 10 years and 39.74% more likely to leave science at the end of the study period. Gender difference in attrition, slightly visible after 5 years, increase consistently in later career stages. The probability of surviving for women after 15 years varies considerably, from 47.8% in AGRI to 27.6% in IMMU; for men, the probability is about a fifth higher. Our data show that with the passage of time, women disappear from science in ever-larger proportions compared to men. Gender differences in attrition in the four disciplines have been and continue to be high, but comparing the 2000 and 2010 cohorts, have slightly decreased over time.",Sociology

We studied what Polish scientists and scholars with various demographic characteristics, academic attitudes, and bibliometric profiles considered their dream salary. Top dreamers were defined as the upper 10% of scientists in terms of self-reported level of their dream salary. Gender differences are much weaker than expected: Women generally tend to have almost equal dream salaries compared to men across age groups, academic positions, and disciplines. Although men are 56% overrepresented in the group of top dreamers, their financial expectations are similar compared to women. Among top dreamers, the median dream salary for men is only 5% higher than the median dream salary for women. Across all STEM disciplines combined, men on average expect salaries 19% higher than women (in non-STEM 15%, and in MED only 11%). Strongly research-oriented men expect higher median salaries than strongly research-oriented women; male top performers (the upper 10%) expect higher salaries than female top performers; and male internationalists in research expect higher salaries than female internationalists. Finally, as logistic regression shows, men with a strong research orientation, working in STEM disciplines, and with strong international research collaborations are most likely to be top dreamers.",Sociology

The workshop was held in Trondheim on November 4-5, 2023 and involved 17 citizens from mid Norway. The good life was the broad theme, and we invited the participants to consider the themes of sustainable health and society within this frame. 
The participants developed 4 different visions for a sustainable healthy future for Norway. We gave them a mid-term horizon (2070) to leave room for needs- and aspirations-based social imagination, not overly conditioned by the current institutional framework, and to challenge the short-termism of the dominant policy cycles and thinking.
The visions developed by the citizens are remarkably consistent in emphasizing the importance of good social integration and community life, interpersonal relations, individual development and an individual’s sense of meaning, contribution, and agency. Noteworthy is also their emphasis on the need to regulate new technologies, and to reduce information overload and unsustainable choices through trusted and transparent governance.
The report provides a discussion of the visions, the full text of the 4 visions and a concise background about the method and the project of which the workshop was part. The Sustainable Healthy Futures pilot was a collaboration between the Norwegian centre for responsible research and Innovation (AFINO) and NTNU Health. The main aim of the project was to rethink health in society in the attempt to imagine innovative and sustainable approaches to health in the future.",Sociology
1231,,"Whether schools perpetuate or mitigate social inequality has been debated for decades. However, one crucial aspect that has remained unexplored is whether and to what extent inequalities manifest differently across schools. Using administrative data from Norway, our study uncovers that the link between parental income and academic achievement in 8th grade varies considerably across schools. In some schools, achievement gaps are more than twice as large as in others. This highlights that schools do not function as uniform entities; rather, some may exacerbate inequalities while others may play a more compensatory role. In fact, in some successful schools, family-level risk factors remain largely unmanifested. While the achievement gap variability is largely unrelated to the socioeconomic composition of schools, lower-quality schools tend to have a stronger income-achievement association than those of higher quality. Overall, our findings emphasize the necessity of a nuanced understanding of how inequalities manifest across diverse school contexts to fully grasp the role of schooling in social inequality and to devise effective strategies for reducing disparities.",Sociology

Systematic data were collected from the English language edition of Wikipedia’s “recent deaths” notices from January 2001 to December 2020 (N = 95,400). Statistical analyses performed on this dataset revealed several structures of inequality shaping the online encyclopedia’s section of “notable deaths”. The results indicate, first, a Western cultural hegemony in terms of the nationality of those whose deaths are remembered in Wikipedia’s necrology section. Second, the paper documented a prevailing hegemonic masculinity epitomized in a stark gender differential. Third, the paper examined the social gradient theory of mortality by comparing the life expectancy of Wikipedia’s notable deceased with the general population and found empirical support for this hypothesis only in non-Western countries characterized by lower levels of income.",Sociology

Despite the availability of various specific metrics, there is a noted absence of a comprehensive framework that integrates these metrics to provide a singular, actionable view of the city's progress towards its social sustainability goals. The City of Vancouver currently employs 45 population-level indicators under its Healthy City Strategy, demonstrating the city's commitment to transparent and data-driven governance. However, these indicators, while effective individually, do not collectively provide a complete picture of the city's overall
health across various dimensions such as public health, housing, education, and environmental sustainability. The aim of this research was to identify a holistic indicator that encompasses multiple dimensions of social sustainability to simplify assessments and improve strategic planning. Through a desktop review of 70 existing indicators and consultations with experts, two models were identified as particularly promising: the Greater London Authority's (GLA) Wellbeing and Sustainability Measure, and the City of Calgary's Equity Index (CEI). These models offer robust frameworks that prioritize equity, accessibility, and stakeholder involvement, aligning closely with Vancouver's urban development goals. This executive summary highlights the need for an overarching metric that reflects the interdependencies among various domains, ensuring that progress in one area does not undermine another. By leveraging insights from this research, Vancouver can enhance its policy implementation and community engagement, moving closer to achieving a balanced and sustainable urban environment. The proposed holistic indicator will also support the city in benchmarking against other urban centers and refining its strategic initiatives based on quantifiable metrics.",Sociology

This paper explores the role of partisan identity in shaping attitude polarisation. It posits that, beyond material interests or stable moral values, partisan identity independently influences social attitudes. Using a series of survey experiments conducted between 2016 and 2018, the effect of the salience of political conflict on attitudes about politically salient issues, such as immigration policy and the regulation of foreign-funded NGOs is investigated. Results indicate that partisan identity independently contributes to the polarisation of attitudes, with respondents exposed to certain politicized issues aligning their views more closely with stereotypical partisan positions on other issues. The paper critiques existing experimental paradigms in political behavior research and highlights the importance of incorporating social psychological approaches to understand the interplay between partisan identity and public opinion formation.",Sociology
1235,,"This paper presents a new modeling framework for the structural explanations of moral action. The framework relies on the approach of the new sociology of morality (Hitlin &amp; Vaisey 2010, 2013, Simpson &amp; Willer 2015) and uses game theory as an analytical tool (c.f. Binmore 1998, 2005, 2010, Gintis 2009, 2016, Guala 2016, Kandori 1992, Vaisey &amp; Valentino 2018). The key contribution of this approach to game theoretical analyses is related to the thesis of intersituationality (Abend 2011, Tavory 2011), according to which no moral dilemma can be investigated in isolation from the system of social life. We propose to reframe moral games in order to incorporate intersituationality. 
The adoption of this sociological approach helps to solve puzzles that have inhibited the development of a comprehensive structural explanation of moral action in moral games. Moreover, by solving those puzzles, this approach opens up new opportunities for applying game theory to the study of such moral orders that foster injustice – an issue that is central to current sociological discourse but has attracted much less attention in game theoretical research.",Sociology

The aim of the paper is to briefly present the basic tenets of this new paradigm, based on some recent monographs and other related publications. Followers of this new paradigm posit that cultural evolution has been dominated biological adaptations and individual rational optimisation in shaping individual behaviour and social structure throughout human history. This review first briefly outlines what economic theory and evolutionary psychology, perhaps the two most influential theoretical paradigms of the study of human behaviour in recent decades, think about human nature. Then it discusses recent empirical evidence related to the assumptions of these two paradigms, and offers an introduction to the basic tenets of the culture-based social theory currently under construction. The study also presents some specific conclusions of the new paradigm that could be relevant for the interpretation of contemporary social problems, and discusses a few points of concern, related to agency, direction of evolution and role of rationality in cultural changes.",Sociology

In this paper, I provide a simple analysis of one medium of social discourse: published books. Using a scrape of the website Goodreads, I examine some key metrics relating to the presence and popularity of books, with a focus on books about transgender people. I scraped the Goodreads page for over 1.6 million books, resulting in 263,597 records that were complete and had some user engagement. Of these, 343 related to transgender people. Books about transgender people were overwhelmingly positive and supportive of trans identities. According to automated classification by a large language model, the 343 books about transgender people were divided into 285 positive books and only 8 negative books (50 could not be classified). Books that were positive about transgender people received more user reviews and stronger average ratings than negative books. Overall, there were 170 times more user reviews of positive transgender books than there were about negative transgender books, which might suggest that Goodreads users are far more likely to interact with supportive books than skeptical or dismissive books about transgender people.",Sociology

To address these shortcomings, the paper turns to an alternative model of LLL: Japan’s food education program, which emphasizes shifting mindsets and behaviors as a strategy to confront environmental challenges in the Global North. While we do not propose Japan’s food education program as a universal solution, it serves as a valuable reference point for reimagining mainstream LLL frameworks.",Sociology
1239,,"This article examines the phenomenon of ""Bad Law"" (""Mal Derecho"") within Argentina's legal tradition, where laws are crafted based on idealistic conceptions of what the legal framework ought to be but lack the practical mechanisms necessary for effective enforcement. This disconnect between a law's design and its implementation fosters a dysfunctional legal system and widespread non-compliance. Rather than addressing the structural flaws within these laws, legal scholars often invoke the “Protective Hypothesis of Bad Law,” attributing non-compliance to a moral failure of the populace instead of recognizing the inherent deficiencies in the legal framework.
This issue is starkly illustrated by Law 27,442 on Antitrust. Although ostensibly designed to promote competition and prevent market distortions, the law suffers from critical design flaws that render enforcement—both public and private—ineffective. Public enforcement is undermined by a lack of political incentives to establish the necessary enforcement authority, a shortcoming embedded within the law itself. Meanwhile, private enforcement remains largely theoretical, as potential plaintiffs are discouraged by the prohibitive complexity and costs of litigation.
As a result, Argentina's competition law fails to achieve its intended objectives, leaving the country’s antitrust system largely ineffective and illusory.",Sociology

This study examines the male fertility decline in Finland during the 2010s, focusing on how fertility levels and trends vary by field of education and the economic uncertainty associated with these fields. Using full population register data, the analysis explores total fertility rates (TFR) and the expected shares of men having a first birth (TFRp1) across 122 detailed education groups. We find that fertility declines were stronger in fields with initially lower fertility levels, such as ICT, arts, and humanities, and weaker in fields like health, teaching, and agriculture. Weighted linear regression was used to analyse the association between characteristics reflecting uncertainty and the fertility decline. Fields with higher unemployment, lower income, and lower occupational match saw sharper fertility declines. Additionally, as unemployment decreased and income grew during the 2010s, fertility declines were less pronounced in fields that experienced stronger improvements in these areas. The predictive power of the uncertainty variables increased in the 2010s. The uncertainty model accounted for approximately half of the TFR decline and two-thirds of the TFRp1 decline across different fields. The study highlights the growing disparities in fertility patterns by educational field, underlining the increasing importance of economic security in shaping men’s fertility.",Sociology

1243,,"Do the social networks of complex large-scale societies share fundamental structural and mathematical properties with the networks of small-scale societies? Can they also best be characterized as discrete, hierarchical, self-similar social networks? There is growing empirical evidence that the generic nature of human social organization may be described in terms of these complex social networks. This emergent form of human social organization has been documented in a wide array of human societies ranging from foraging groups to the urban and sociopolitical organization of the first states and empires. This paper contributes to this growing literature by using Horton--Strahler scaling and spectral analysis to demonstrate the complex structure of large-scale societies using the Coalescent Communities Database 2.0 and Seshat: Global History Databank. The analysis finds a discrete hierarchy of community sizes that approaches the well-known series 15, 50, 150, 500, 1500 and a scaling ratio of between 3 and 4. These properties of complex large-scale societies are remarkably consistent with previous empirical studies of small-scale societies. I suggest that these patterns can be understood in terms of a general recursive process that is responsible for the formation of increasingly larger-scale societies and the cognitive limitations inherent to human nature.",Sociology

This study characterizes heatwave adaptation internationally, combining ERA5 climate re-analysis, cell phone mobility, socio-economic, and physical-geographical data across Brazil, France, India, Nigeria, Turkey, the USA, and China during 2022/2023 summer heatwaves. Google Community Mobility Reports data is used in multi-level modelling for the first six countries to examine daily activity changes during heatwaves (home, work, transit, grocery/pharmacy, retail/recreation, parks). In China, Baidu data on intra-city activity levels is analyzed in a complementary multi-level model. The results show a widespread tendency to withdraw into homes but also highlight unequal substitutions of activities, and – under some circumstances – visits to potentially cooler locations away from home. This study highlights the global nature of heatwave adaptation and the value of considering adaptation alongside people’s everyday lives.",Sociology
1245,,"This chapter reviews past and ongoing debates about how to measure the strength and erosion of norms in international politics. The operationalization and measurement of norm strength have long challenged norms researchers. However, contemporary conceptual and methodological work has achieved notable breakthroughs and emerging common understandings around these measurement issues. First, the chapter summarizes four longstanding challenges in measuring norm strength: differing levels of analysis, tautology, cross-case comparison, and the static nature of many potential measures contrasted with the dynamic nature of norms. It then outlines the emerging common approach of combining measures of rhetoric and practice relating to norm strength. Different traditions of empirical norms research study these dimensions of norm strength at the individual level, state level, or across the entire international system. The chapter combines these levels and actors on the one hand with rhetorical and practical dimensions on the other in a matrix for generating ideas about possible avenues for empirical research designs on norm strength. It concludes by summarizing which recent methodological innovations may be particularly promising for advancing our empirical insights on norm strength and erosion.",Sociology

In this work, we studied scientific output and potential gender disparities in faculty positions at the Complutense University of Madrid (UCM), the largest academic institution in Spain. We found that women are clearly underrepresented in full professor positions despite being a majority in lower academic ranks. This gender disparity in full professor positions is however narrowing down in recent years. The scientific output of researches, as judged by the h-index, varied greatly between Faculties, but overall, correlated positively with the academic rank and no significant differences were detected between women and men, although exceptions were noted. Judging by the m-index, the scientific output of women and men in full professor positions were also alike. In sum, there is effective equality between genders within UCM faculty ranks.",Sociology
1247,,"In 2017, Finland introduced a partial old-age pension scheme, allowing individuals to claim either 25 or 50 percent of their old-age pension after turning 61, irrespective of their employment status. Claiming a partial pension before the statutory retirement age results in a permanent reduction of the full old-age pension. Due to the rapid rise in consumer prices in 2022, individuals who claimed their pension before the end of 2022 benefited from a three-percentage points higher index adjustment in 2023, resulting in a permanently higher pension compared to those who claimed their pension in early 2023. In this study, we assess the causal effect of the financial incentive arising from the exceptional index adjustment on pension take-up using regression discontinuity design and full population register data. We also analyse differences in responses by socioeconomic status and gender. The extraordinary pension index adjustment increased the probability of claiming the partial old-age pension in the first month after becoming eligible for it by around 8 percentage points, or around 80 per cent. The effect is explained by individuals claiming a pension sooner than they would have in the absence of the exceptional index adjustment. Individuals with a higher pension accrual, higher earnings, or with upper tertiary education were more likely than others to respond to the index adjustment.",Sociology

However, the lack of comparable cross-national data on trust in bureaucracy has limited our ability to systematically examine these relationships. To address this gap, we develop the Trust in Civil Servants (TCS) dataset using an advanced latent-variable modeling technique, using 132 national and cross-national surveys from 98 countries (1986-2022). Our measures reveal variations in trust both within and between countries. We find that economic performance and public security enhance trust in the short term, whereas government quality and effectiveness have more enduring, long-term impacts on trust in civil service. The TCS dataset opens new avenues for examining connections between trust, governance quality, and complex policy challenges across different contexts.",Sociology

We contend that to understand these objects and their place in our social world, we must attend to a linguistic sociology. In the context of large language models, for example, language -text, specifically- acts as both the input and output interface between person and machine. Yet text is itself a language technology, and carries with it affordances and constraints that remember long histories of social relations. Quilting together literature from sociology, computational linguistics, science and technology studies, and linguistic anthropology, we ask: what do language technologies remember, and how can sociologists take these memories into account? To answer this question, we offer a three-part analytical framework to examine how the memories of language technologies are both constructed by and constructing our social world. Drawing on two examples of use of language technologies in college admissions and in scientific peer review, we apply our framework to demonstrate how language technologies can mediate social actions, processes, and relations.",Sociology
1250,,"While travelers may have the same origin and destination for their trips, these trips may be associated with different travel times. Understanding what factors contribute to different travel times contributes to better transportation planning and driver experience improvement. Big mobile device data offers new opportunities to understand travelers’ driving behaviors by providing high-resolution trip trajectory data. In this study we analyzed factors including driver behaviors, built environment and road characteristics, and external factors (e.g., traffic incidents and weather), for their contributions to travel times for two different travel contexts, commuting in an urban environment and rural trips involving a vacation destination, using machine learning approaches including time-series clustering and Random Forest regression models. We found that specific driver route choices (i.e., the different routes that drivers followed including the use of highways or local roads), and individualized travel speed behaviors including speeding contributed to variations in travel times. Vehicle profiles (i.e., types of vehicle drivers used) and road incidents had different impacts for different trip contexts. These results are useful for urban and transportation planners seeking mitigations that reduce travel time along heavily traveled driving routes and contribute to determining more accurate travel time predictions.",Sociology
1251,,"EU industrial policymaking involves political choices and trade-offs with far-reaching distributive consequences. This working paper submits that EU industrial policymakers should be democratically accountable, particularly through oversight by the European Parliament over the European Commission, with input from the Council, Court of Auditors, and Economic and Social Committee. Parliamentary oversight should be more stringent in areas marked by complexity and the need for democratic legitimation, both of which apply to EU industrial policy, especially in state aid control. To assess accountability, the working paper maps the activities of two key committees during the 9th legislative term (2019–2024): the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy (ITRE) and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON). Our mapping of ITRE activities shows that its scrutiny of industrial policy is limited and needs strengthening. Additionally, there were no joint procedures with ECON, which could be improved. For ECON, oversight has been limited, with its main activity—an annual report on competition policy—not fully addressing the fast-evolving competition and state aid policy field. Based on this assessment, the working paper introduces four recommendations to improve democratic accountability in EU industrial policy during the 10th parliamentary term (2024–2029): 1. Establish a joint ITRE-ECON working group to focus on industrial policy and state aid control, tasked with conducting a dedicated Industrial Policy Dialogue. 2. Have the new working group produce bi-annual or quarterly EU Industrial Policy Reports to support detailed oversight. 3. Adjust ITRE’s mandate by reallocating research and telecommunications files to another committee and adding state aid to ITRE’s scope. 4. Leverage inputs from various stakeholders, including the Economic and Social Committee, the Court of Auditors, the Industrial, and the Joint European forums for IPCEIs, to strengthen legislative oversight.",Sociology
1252,,"Purpose
In August 2022, the Association of Social Work Boards released a long called for pass rate analysis that revealed significant disparities. While many states look to cease the requirement of the Bachelors, Masters, and Advanced Generalist exams in their licensure process, status quo bias leads to hesitancy to remove the requirement of the Clinical exam.
Method
A critical review was undertaken to identify possible alternatives to the current multiple-choice competency-based exam which yielded three assessment formats (oral exams, portfolios, and performance assessment/simulations) and two alternatives (jurisprudence exams and provisional licensure). Informed by an Afrocentric lens, we undertook a social and racial policy analysis to examine alternative pathways for licensure from the perspective of a social work board member. We centered our analysis on the impacts on (1) Black social workers, who currently have the highest pass-rate disparities; (2) social workers whose primary language is not English, and (3) social workers with disabilities who have anecdotally reported difficulty with getting testing accommodations. We rated each alternative on four social equity analysis criteria of procedural fairness, access, quality, and outcomes. These ratings were computed into an overall rating for each alternative from equitable to inequitable.
Results
We found jurisprudence exams and provisional licensure have the best possibility of being equitable pathways to licensure, with potential impacts on the regulation of supervision and continuing education.

Anti-racism and social justice as praxis require social work as a profession to divest from competency-based testing to eliminate racism in our own professional policies.",Sociology
1253,,"What enables humanity to flourish? Surely, it is more than our biological survival as individuals, or even as a species. As a modern science, biology does not typically address the social, ethical and religious dimensions of human flourishing. Here I propose a transdisciplinary scientific framework for flourishing, rooted in evolvability: the capacity to increase the probability of an evolutionary outcome. I define human energy as a fuel for our evolvability as a species, reflecting a natural extension of biological processes that utilize dynamically structured, latent energy to anticipate the future. These processes of creative energy leverage serendipitous interactions within biochemical, neural, and social networks to constellate innovative pathways. As a result of this creative energy, organisms are more than literally “alive” (surviving) but are “meta-alive,” (flourishing and evolvable). Nonetheless, purely biological descriptions and investigations are insufficient to describe, let alone explain flourishing at the level of humanity. Humans imagine the future. We are nourished not only from metabolism, but through the energy of the arts, literature, and religion (the humanities). Mirroring prior major evolutionary transitions, human energy enables transcendence: moving from the biology of the individual to novel forms at a collective level. Human energy manifests this through imagination, compassion and what the poet Keats’ called, negative capability, a radical stance of not-knowing. Making sense of these energetic transitions requires a new metascience, a transdisciplinary bridge between the biological sciences and the humanities.",Sociology

In this study, we provide a longitudinal perspective to the labor market integration of young people by analyzing the dynamics of being a young Not in Employment, Education or Training (NEET).
We focus on entry to and persistence of the NEET situation across time, namely genuine state dependence, by using correlated dynamic random-effects logit models to study the effect of the past on the current NEET situation. We analyze longitudinal individual-level data covering the full population living in Finland with a follow-up from age 18 till age 29 from 1995 till 2020.
Our findings suggest clear state dependence in the NEET situation: being NEET in the previous year is associated with almost a 3-percentage-point increase in the probability of being NEET in the current year. We find that the state dependence of the NEET situation is moderately elevated for males and for those with lower parental educational attainment and considerably elevated for those with foreign origin or history of mental health issues or with child protection services.",Sociology
1255,,"An increasing number of countries are considering implementing domestic carbon taxes to achieve the carbon-reduction targets set in the Paris Agreement. However, introducing such taxes presents significant challenges for policymakers worldwide. Despite their effectiveness, carbon taxes remain the least popular policy instrument. Furthermore, few studies focus on public support for carbon taxation in low- and middle-income countries, a crucial area of research given the global significance of their emissions. Therefore, we conducted a pre-registered full factorial survey experiment involving more than 13,000 evaluations of policy designs in China, Germany, India, and the UK to address the most prevalent barriers to the popularity of carbon taxes, as discussed in academic research, policy analysis, and public discourse: perceived effectiveness, average household costs, the types of revenue recycling schemes implemented, and the extent of international cooperation. Our findings revealed striking differences in how the countries responded to carbon tax policies. The key findings included the following: cost transparency unexpectedly reduced support, whereas communicating the effectiveness of the policy increased 
it; preferences for revenue recycling schemes varied significantly across the four countries, highlighting the need for tailored approaches; and, surprisingly, international cooperation increased support only in Germany, challenging assumptions about global climate policy. These findings have profound implications for policymakers, suggesting that an effective carbon tax design must be carefully calibrated in the national context. This study provides a roadmap for designing carbon tax policies that are environmentally effective and politically viable for diverse global economies.",Sociology

1257,,"This essay examines the balance between the right to “privacy” and the right to “security” for citizens in the information age.  
At the global level, these two rights appear in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) [23]: (i) ”No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honor and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks” (Article 12); (ii) ”Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person” (Article 6). 
Although UDHR have been adopted nearly all countries in the world, not all of the rights embodied in the declaration have been protected. In particular, the right to “privacy” is frequently violated in the name of “security”. My discussions will be limited to two jurisdictions: the United States (US) and the European Union (EU). 
The concept of “privacy”, as it has evolved from the 1890 seminal paper: “Right to Privacy”, by Samuel D. Warren and Louis D. Brandeis (until now at least in Europe and the United States), is a crucial right for an individual. The advent of information communication technologies (ICTs), and the internet, has made it difficult not only to protect this right but also in some circumstances to justify its protection. ICTs, with all their periphery of devices (such as PCs and smart phones) and services (such as email and text messages), have made the collection, storage and delivery through online personal information/data much easier than ever before. 
“Personal information data” has become a crucial resource for international businesses and trade. Businesses such as air transportation and the credit card industry rely on the flow and processing of “personal information data” between countries or different jurisdictions. “Personal information data”, however, is also a crucial resource for security and law enforcement. This has become particularly crucial, for example, since the terrorist attacks of 9/11. Indeed the imperative to protect a country from terrorist attacks has made the collection, storage and processing of “personal information data” a fact of daily life.
For an individual, “personal information data” can reveal a great deal about his/her private life. The processing of this information or its use thus has an impact on the individual. 
The “right to privacy” is under threat locally, nationally and globally. One of the major threats originates from governments with justifiable security and law enforcement concerns, and challenges such as the threats posed by terrorism and the proliferation of indecent material, especially among children. Governments in most democratic countries or regions view security issues largely through the lens of law enforcement. For example, in Europe reference can be made to the “European Convention of Human Rights” [22] which, in Article 8, highlights the protection of “privacy” (albeit with some limitations).
This dissertation is organized as follows.
In chapter one, I will examine the concept of the “right to privacy”.  What is “privacy”? Why is it important and why should we care about it? For the purposes of this dissertation, I will focus on “information privacy” and “data Protection”.
In chapter two, I will examine how this right is protected in the EU and will discuss the balance between privacy and security. I will look at the EU Directive  on Data Protection [20] and the proposed new Directive on data protection [21]. 
In chapter three, I will discuss privacy protection in the US and the balance between privacy protection and security. For the US, there is no comprehensive data protection legal framework such as the EU Data Protection Directive. Privacy rights are protected under the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution and several laws covering “sectors of the information economy” under federal statutory law [14, page 34-36, 18]. 
In Chapter four, I will conclude the discussion on the the balance between “privacy” and “security” with a brief comparison of the two jurisdictions.",Sociology

It compares, in each year, levels of health according to these measures amongst the employed with those in the unemployed and permanently sick. It finds that for many conditions there was a particularly large improvement among men who were economically inactive and unemployed, greater than that in the employed. By 2001, health in unemployed men in several respects was superior to that of the employed. The results are discussed in terms of their relevance to understanding some paradoxes in the British labour market in the early 1980s, such as the relationship between unemployment and wage inflation.",Sociology

1265,,"Many medical appointments involve encounters with patients who report physical symptoms, including experiences of pain or altered sensations (paraesthesia), where health professionals cannot generate an explanation based on scans, blood tests, or other currently privileged forms of medical evidence. In these cases, the personal interruptions of illness are not easily resolved through the narrative of investigation followed by treatment. Other things are created in this absence, including patient anxiety and medical uncertainty, even patient isolation and health professional avoidance, which exacerbate the impact of symptoms. This paper recounts my own experience of receiving a negative scan for cauda equina syndrome and my subsequent search for a meaningful account of what was happening to my body. I use autoethnography to illustrate how these ‘medically unexplained’ symptoms were reinterpreted by health professionals and myself through different forms of encounter, evidence, and explanation, in ways that shifted interpretations and bodily sensations, but offered limited ideas for recovery. The account is personal, in the details of navigating the UK health services with ‘medically unexplained’ symptoms during an ongoing pandemic, and the way I found conversations around functional neurological symptoms helpful for making sense of corporeal experience. Concluding, I reflect on the importance of listening responsively to patient stories in the case of ‘medically unexplained’ or functional symptoms.

Such data (e.g., from social media) feed into case?worker systems and inform decisions on whether to grant asylum to an applicant or not. During the asylum process both governmental authorities and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have a formal role assisting individuals applying for asylum in understanding, intervening in, and participating in the sociotechnical infrastructures through which data are produced and used, defined as data infrastructure literacy. In this article we ask: In the context of mobile phone data transforming asylum casework in Denmark, what characterizes data infrastructure literacy for different stakeholders in the asylum process, including those subjected to the asylum procedure? The research presented in this article is informed by qualitative data
produced through semi-structured interviews (N = 10), summaries of asylum cases from both a public and a non-public dataset, and 160 hours of observational studies. Our findings suggest that data obtained from mobile phones have become an integral part of asylum decision-making. Furthermore, our findings suggest that data infrastructure literacy is conditioned by stakeholders’ understanding of mobile phone data as assembled and utilized in the following ways: (1) through distributed, collaborative, and data-driven efforts, (2) at every stage of the asylum procedure and beyond, (3) as back-up data for credibility assessment, (4) in unequal power dynamics of consent, and (5) by practices that continue to transform by use of new types of data.

It provides an in-depth review of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, treatment, prevention strategies, psychosocial impacts, health policies, and persistent barriers associated with the HIV/AIDS epidemic.

The study examines global prevalence and incidence patterns, with a focus on the disproportionate impact in sub-Saharan Africa and key demographics such as men who have sex with men (MSM), intravenous drug users (IDUs), and marginalized youth. It highlights gender and age-specific prevalence disparities and discusses how these intersect with socio-behavioral determinants of health.

Mechanisms of HIV infection are analyzed, detailing how the virus depletes CD4 T-cells, leading to immune system compromise. Modes of transmission, including sexual contact, vertical transmission, and blood exposure, are evaluated alongside risk-enhancing factors such as substance use and insufficient awareness.

Advances in treatment are a key focus, with antiretroviral therapy (ART) highlighted as the cornerstone of HIV management. The potential of emerging therapies, such as long-acting injectables and gene-editing technologies, is discussed in the context of achieving functional cures. Challenges to treatment adherence and access are critically examined.

Prevention strategies are explored through a dual lens: behavioral interventions like condom use and sexual health education, and biomedical measures including pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). Structural interventions and policy initiatives addressing social determinants of health are assessed, emphasizing the role of community-based programs in reducing transmission and improving outcomes.

The psychosocial dimensions of HIV/AIDS are analyzed, with particular attention to stigma, discrimination, and their impacts on mental health and treatment compliance. The importance of support networks and community engagement in fostering resilience and adherence is underscored.

Finally, the paper evaluates national and international policy responses, detailing the contributions of organizations such as WHO and UNAIDS. Persistent challenges, including healthcare disparities, drug resistance, and gaps in research, are addressed, alongside calls for culturally sensitive, equitable care approaches and sustained funding.

This research synthesizes current knowledge, identifies critical gaps, and outlines future directions to enhance prevention, treatment, and policy frameworks, ultimately aiming to improve outcomes for individuals and communities affected by HIV/AIDS.",Sociology

1272,,"Objectives Although the social disorganization tradition emphasizes the role of neighborhood context in shaping delinquent behaviors and neighborhood crime, researchers have rarely considered the influence of neighborhood context on criminals’ decision of where to offend. This study explicitly examines how concentrated disadvantage in both the origin and destination neighborhoods structures burglars’ preference for street physical disorder and spatial familiarity.
Methods We measure observed and perceived physical disorder from 107,858 street view images using computer vision algorithms. Geo-referenced mobile phone flows between 1,642 census units are used to approximate offenders’ potential spatial knowledge about target neighborhoods. Discrete choice models are estimated separately for burglars from disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged neighborhoods (N=1,972).
Results While burglars residing in non-disadvantaged neighborhoods are not sensitive to physical disorder in non-disadvantaged target neighborhoods, they strongly avoid disadvantaged neighborhoods with disorder. Conversely, residents of neighborhoods with concentrated disadvantage swiftly act upon street disorder in better-off neighborhoods but not in disadvantaged neighborhoods. These tendencies to react to the presence of physical disorder on the street are also contingent on burglars’ potential familiarity with the target environment.
Conclusions We highlight the importance of larger neighborhood structural characteristics and their interactions with spatial knowledge and environmental conditions such as visual signs of disorder, in criminal decision making. Physical disorder is not uniformly indicative of decay across neighborhoods and offenders. This divergent decision-making may also partially explain spatial heterogeneity of crime. Moreover, spatial knowledge is most effective in triggering or deterring actions in places that are categorically different from offenders’ residential spaces.",Sociology
1273,,"Individualism, characterized by autonomy, independence and self-expression is typically seen as a modern and Western phenomenon. Cultural historians, however, have pointed out that its roots extend much further into the past. In this paper, we delve deeper in time to quantify the rise of individualism in history. Using data from the China Biographical Database (CBDB, N = 641,568) spanning 1,500 years of Chinese history (540-1880 CE), we observe a long-term increase in name uniqueness, a common proxy for individualism. Our analysis reveals that this general increase parallels the economic development and modernization of China throughout the Imperial period. Consistent with this, the economically advanced Yangtze River Delta exhibits consistently higher levels of name uniqueness compared to less developed regions. Finally, we observe a decline in name uniqueness during the late Qing dynasty, coinciding with a period of economic crisis. These results suggest that the rise of individualism is tied to economic development and modernization, transcending cultural and geographic boundaries. Our findings contribute to a more nuanced understanding of cultural evolution in China and challenge long-held assumptions about the immutability of Chinese culture. This research provides new insights into the complex relationship between economic development, cultural change, and the emergence of individualistic values in non-Western contexts.",Sociology
1274,,"Many components of cultural repertoire theory have proven difficult to operationalize. This has hindered research on the effects of individual cultural resources and about the accuracy of repertoire theory’s key premises. This paper draws on original longitudinal survey data to investigate the effects of cultural repertoire diversity on individual wellbeing. Using a novel measure of the variety of interpretive frames known by expectant mothers, I find that women with more diverse cultural repertoires experience worse postpartum wellbeing than do their counterparts, controlling for relevant covariates. This contradicts hypotheses derived from repertoire theory. Accompanying qualitative data suggest that uncertainty-based anxiety and distress underlie the effect and reveal new insights about the social context of repertoire development. This paper overcomes a long-standing barrier to understanding how culture affects social life, identifies a previously unrecognized socio-cultural influence on postpartum wellbeing, and suggests new directions for the study of culture.",Sociology
1275,,"While there is a strong educational gradient to the risk of experiencing long periods of unemployment and insecurity at the beginning of the career, recent evidence suggests local labour market circumstances can moderate the degree of risk associated with low educational achievement. We test the wider applicability of this finding by exploring the effect of spatial variation in labour demand on initial job search time in the contrasting institutional settings of Germany and the United Kingdom. Survival analysis of Understanding Society and Socio-Economic Panel data 1998–2015 shows this form of spatial inequality moderates the size of the job search time penalty associated with low educational attainment (and the size of the returns associated with higher attainment) in a similar way in both countries. Young people in places of high labour demand in Germany and the UK obtain employment with relative ease irrespective of the qualifications they hold. However, educational attainment assumes greater consequence as local labour demand declines. On average, low qualified young people in places of weak demand experience 2-3 month longer periods of labour market lockout and 8-10 month longer periods of labour market insecurity than peers located in places of strong demand, and considerably longer periods of lockout and insecurity than their better qualified peers in the same weak labour markets. These findings draw attention to the contextual nature of the risks associated with low educational attainment and the rewards to higher levels of attainment, at least in terms of job search time.",Sociology

Drawing on interviews with 25 experts from education policy, educational technology, and data justice sectors, the present research identifies four key discourses: the “agentic child” as an active participant in data practices; the “juridical child” requiring protection under data laws; the “citizen-child” prepared for future societal roles through data literacy; and the “learning child” benefiting from personalized, data-driven pedagogy. These discourses reveal a complex, multifaceted conceptualization of children, shaped by ethical, legal, and pedagogical considerations, highlighting the interplay between childhood agency, rights, and education in a data-driven society.",Sociology
1277,,"Inspired by anecdotal evidence of congressional witness testimony impact, we analyze a dataset of 661 testimonies from hearings between 2007 and 2017 associated with the legislative history of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PL 111-148) to demonstrate that witness testimony impacts legislative, administrative, and judicial outcomes. We analyze 76,138 pages of legislative documents, administrative guidance, and judicial proceedings, which we designate as the “Legislative History and Impact Corpus” (LHIC). We fine tune a large language model (LLM) to conduct a comprehensive search for high-semantic similarity sentence pairings or strong associations between witness testimony and outcomes. The direct references and high-similarity statements we identify prove that congressional witness testimony does impact outcomes across the legislative and judicial branches. We identify testimony from witnesses serving myriad functions impacting legislative and judicial outcomes, and these impacts were reflected irrespective of political party or role in Congress and at multiple points during judicial challenges. Additionally, we found (1) instances where witness testimony has impacts outside of the legislative process; and (2) long-term relationships between witnesses and Congress influence legislative outcomes. 

While our findings may be obvious to those who have ever worked on Capitol Hill or testified before Congress, these findings are not well-documented in the existing political science literature. Ours is one of the first papers to use LLMs to investigate congressional hearings, and these tools expand the potential for political textual analysis.",Sociology
1278,,"As environmental awareness grows and global supply chains become increasingly fragile, urban gardening has seen a surge in public demand. While allotments as a horticultural source of individual well-being have been widely studied in social psychology, their significance for societal cohesion has not yet been sociologically theorized and empirically investigated. Focusing on Germany, a country with a long tradition of urban allotments commonly known as “Schrebergarten,” we conceptualize urban gardens as multifaceted social units characterized by both material and associational dynamics. Since becoming institutionalized by 19th-century conservative social reformers, they have been conceived as loci of family retreat, depoliticization in quasi-homeownership, private insurance against food price inflation, and embourgeoisement of the working classes. Drawing on unique panel data (1990-2013), we challenge the petty bourgeois image of the Schrebergarten, showing that it brings together heterogeneous strata of educated left-wing citizens with ecological concerns, particularly in urban areas and East Germany, with no evidence of political embourgeoisement. If anything, the Schrebergarten increases secular social and political engagement beyond family life, facilitating social integration, especially for foreign citizens. Overall, the Schrebergarten disappoints most of the socio-political expectations classically ascribed to it and should rather be considered as a site of socialization and politicization.",Sociology
1279,,"The Conference on the Future of Europe is an innovative deliberative process that European Union (EU) institutions established to reflect on the future of the EU through bottom-up engagement with the citizens. The Conference took off, with delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic, on 9 May 2021, and came to a close a year later on 9 May 2022, when the war in Ukraine was already raging. The Conference ended with a final report that laid out 49 proposals and 326 detailed recommendations for reforming EU policies and institutions. The Conference’s final outcome clearly identified the existing weaknesses of the EU and unequivocally mapped a path to address them, including by recommending treaty changes in a number of key areas related to the governance and the resilience of the EU. The follow-up to the Conference, however, has so far been underwhelming; while a number of institutions and member states have openly called for amending the treaties, other actors have dragged their feet. As a result, the reform process has stalled, and whether the prospect of enlargement may revive it remains to be seen. If the EU can mobilise the political will to change the EU treaties, however, the recommendations of the Conference can serve as a valuable blueprint for needed constitutional adjustments.",Sociology
1280,,"This study aims to observe what differences there are between pseudoscientific and scientific disciplines according to different bibliometric parameters such as citation, funding acknowledgments, composition of journals’ editorial boards, authorship, integrity, and social impact. An experimental model has been designed to pairwise compare the performance of three pseudoscientific communities as treatment groups (Chiropractics, Psychoanalysis and Integrative medicine) against a control group of three similar scientific fields (Physical therapy, Clinical psychology and General medicine). 83k articles from scholarly journals associated with these disciplines were extracted from Scopus. To avoid a size factor, journals from each pairwise group (control vs. treatment) were selected with similar impact measures (i.e., CiteScore). The findings reveal that pseudosciences tend to be more isolated and more resistant to external ideas and contributors. There is a geographical/cultural pattern in the distribution of authors and organization types. Whereas Chiropractics and Psychoanalysis are Western disciplines, Integrative medicine is strongly supported by Asian governments (China, India, South Korea). In all the cases, there is an important presence of non-scholarly entities involved in pseudoscientific studies, in front of a great presence of governmental and university actors in scientific disciplines.",Sociology
1281,,"Public land management relies on accurate visitor counts in order to understand and mitigate environmental impacts and to quantify the value of ecosystem services provided by natural areas. We built and tested predictive visitation models suitable for publicly-managed parks, open space and other protected lands based on multiple sources of digital mobility data including posts to social media, recreation report platforms, and a cellular device location dataset from a commercial vendor. Using observational visitation data series from the United States’ National Park Service, Forest Service and Fish and Wildlife Service, we quantified the accuracy of statistical models to predict on-the-ground visitation using individual and combined sources of locational data. We found the predictive models performed best in settings where some on-site visitation data can be integrated into the models. On-site visitation data helps to account for meaningful differences in modeled relationships both within and across the three agencies considered. We found variation in the usefulness of the digital mobility data sources, with models combining multiple data sources outperforming those using a single source, including those based solely on cellular device locations. We discuss the practical implications of these findings as well as paths forward to improve visitation estimation on public lands by incorporating digital mobility data.",Sociology

1283,,"This study investigates differences in how same-sex male, same-sex female, and different-sex couples outsource routine and non-routine housework. Previous research highlights how same-sex and different-sex couples allocate time to housework, but the outsourcing of these tasks remains understudied. Considering variations in household resources and cultural norms, the study explores whether and how these groups differ in outsourcing routine tasks (e.g., cleaning) and non-routine tasks (e.g., home maintenance and yardwork). Using data from the 2003–2019 waves of the Consumer Expenditure Survey and a double hurdle methodological approach, this study analyzes the likelihood of outsourcing and amount spent on overall and specific housework tasks among same-sex male, same-sex female, and different-sex couples. Findings reveal minimal differences across couple type in outsourcing home maintenance, yardwork, and cleaning. However, same-sex male couples are generally more likely to outsource any housework compared to different-sex couples, though this association becomes null once household income is accounted for, highlighting the role of economic resources in enabling the “Buying Out” strategy. Notably, differences across couple type are only evident in the probability of outsourcing, with no significant variation in spending among those who outsource, suggesting that selection into outsourcing is more varied than differences in spending intensity. These findings emphasize the importance of economic resources in shaping domestic outsourcing behaviors and suggest that the equitable division of housework often observed in same-sex couples may be attributed to factors beyond reliance on outsourcing.",Sociology
1284,,"Given in the increase in share of older people as well as the decrease in family size, it can be expected that more and more informal care will fall onto the shoulders of non-kin, such as neighbors. Currently, neighbors rarely provide informal care and knowledge on their characteristics and motivations is limited. Our study advances our knowledge of neighbor caregivers by examining the impact of anticipated reciprocity and previous (negative) caregiving experience. Combining retrospective and factorial survey data on caregiving, we show that people have higher intentions to provide care to a neighbor when likelihood of reciprocity is high (compared to low), and that prior caregiving experience is irrelevant for intentions to provide care to neighbors. However, our study suggests that the impact of reciprocity may depend on previous caregiving experience; having actual caregiving experience overrides expectations regarding the general norm of reciprocity, but only if the previous caregiver did not experience caregiver burden. With these results, the study indicates that neighbors can form potential safety net for those who cannot rely on their family members for care.",Sociology
1285,,"This study investigates the relationships of prediction time and confidence levels with prediction errors in light of interpersonal projection bias. Systematic prediction errors are frequently caused by projection bias, a cognitive distortion in which people project their current preferences or attitudes onto others. Even though interpersonal projection bias has been well studied in the past, the impacts of task duration, confidence level and instructional guidance on such prediction errors still need to be sufficiently explored. By examining whether these factors affect the size of prediction errors, this study aims to close that gap. The primary goal is to present empirical evidence for how participants’ such characteristics shape their prediction accuracy, building on the framework of Benjamin Bushong and Tristan Gagnon-Bartsch’s seminal work ”Failures in Forecasting: An Experiment on Interpersonal Projection Bias.” The findings show that overconfidence bolsters the prediction error while no remarkable impact is observed by prediction time and instructional guidance.",Sociology
1286,,"Objective: This paper examines to what extent one’s partner’s informal helping behavior stimulates informal helping behavior of the other partner and to what extent this partner effect differs by gender. Differences in informal help given to kin and non-kin are explored.
Background: Although prior research has suggested that partners influence each other’s (informal) helping behavior, these mostly cross-sectional studies did not account for possible selection effects. The present study takes a longitudinal approach to examine whether the partner’s helping behavior changes informal helping over time, thereby diminishing the impact of selection, and allowing for a more stringent test of partner influence.
Method: Using three waves of dyadic data from the Swiss Household Panel (2013, 2016, 2019) (N = 9,666), we employ fixed-effects logistic regression analysis to eliminate between-person differences. To facilitate interpretation of the effects, we estimate average logit elasticities.
Results: People whose partner started engaging in informal helping had a higher likelihood of providing informal help. This relationship did not differ between men and women but was stronger for help to kin than to help to non-kin.
Conclusion: Findings suggest that the relationship between partners’ (informal) helping behavior is not solely due to selection effects but is at least partly the result of partner influence. New questions surface about differences between help between kin and non-kin.",Sociology

Drawing on theoretical perspectives such as the Spiral of Silence and collective action constraints, this research explores how sociopolitical context shapes public opinion in an authoritarian country. Using cross-national survey data, the analysis reveals significant differences in war-related assessments. Despite severe economic repercussions, many Russians report optimism about the war’s effects, especially on economic growth, diverging from the prevalent concerns in neighboring nations. Key factors such as gender, education, region of residence, institutional trust, and media consumption explain the heterogeneity in these perceptions. The findings underscore the role of individual characteristics, regional contexts, and institutional trust in sustaining public support for conflict in complex sociopolitical environments, contributing to broader discussions on national contexts and public attitudes in wartime.",Sociology

It ponders the questions: What does such an integration mean for the actors developing digital agriculture, and how do they frame it? What do we learn from their understandings regarding how sustainable digital climate(s) are pursued? Two findings emerge from mapping these actors and analyzing their discourses. First, agriculture is witnessing the emergence of novel expertise from professionals previously unconnected to farming, who are now collaborating with agricultural experts. Second, these new actors promote a distinct vision of sustainable agriculture centered on collecting granular data about plant life; hence the motto ""becoming granular, being sustainable."" The analysis draws on sociotechnical perspectives to examine how sensor technologies build upon existing infrastructures and knowledge while also exploring how actors compare and frame granularity across different contexts and how granularity can be seen as multiplying agencies instead of closing them down.",Sociology
1289,,"For nearly as long as the rational voting paradox has puzzled scholars, it has been recognized that voters' decisions are influenced by expressive motivations. Yet, since disentangling emotional from instrumental drivers remains an inherently difficult task, little is known about how voting on the former grounds can shape future political preferences. We fill this gap by focusing on a rare instance of expressive voting: support for the Italian Communist Party (PCI) in the 1984 European election, preceded by the sudden death of PCI's leader, Enrico Berlinguer. Via a Regression Discontinuity approach, exploiting differential expressive motives along the border(s) of Berlinguer's electoral district, we show that municipal-level support for PCI increased more sharply in 1984 in areas where voters could express their preference for the just-deceased leader. Combining voting records and individual survey data, we further show how votes cast on expressive grounds in 1984 returned to PCI for about five years since Berlinguer's death.",Sociology
1290,,"This study systematically examines the impact of conservative ideologies on gender dynamics, focusing on women and families in the USA and India since 2010. By employing both qualitative and quantitative analysis, the research delves into the socio-political landscapes of both countries to identify how conservative movements, policies, and cultural norms have influenced gender roles and expectations. Data were collected through an extensive literature review and policy analysis. The research provides a detailed definition of conservatism in both India and the USA, noting its promotion of profit and output and the associated gender roles and systemic oppression. It also acknowledges that the definition of conservatism can vary based on different perspectives.

The historical context of conservatism is explored, examining its evolution in India and the USA and identifying factors such as religion, post-colonialism, male dominance, economic conditions, biological perspectives, and cultural influences contributing to its popularity. The study highlights significant events and their impacts on gender equality and rights, as well as the current state of conservatism in both countries. The research investigates the theoretical framework of gender roles and expectations under conservative ideologies, presenting arguments for and against conservatism's impact on gender dynamics. In India, the focus is on the BJP's policies and their effects on women's political representation, economic opportunities, and social norms. In the USA, the analysis centres on the Republican Party's influence during the Trump administration and its implications for gender roles and societal norms. 

Central to the study is Project NeoWave, the fifth wave of feminism, which addresses gender minority development. The research details the emergence and characteristics of this movement, discussing the influence of radical feminism and its associated critiques. It explores new ideas such as nuanced rights for women, the concept of new domesticity, and systemic changes aimed at altering men's mindsets towards equality.

A comparative analysis identifies critical similarities and differences in conservatism's economic, political, social, and cultural impacts on gender dynamics in both countries. This includes examining employment opportunities, wage gaps, political representation, societal expectations, and the influence of religion and traditional values. The research evaluates existing policies and mitigation efforts for gender and minority development, highlighting successful initiatives and proposing future recommendations. By integrating Project NeoWave’s progressive principles with conservative values, the study aims to formulate effective policies that support gender and minority development. This research advances the discourse on conservatism’s role in shaping gender dynamics, offering valuable insights for policymakers, scholars, and advocates. By establishing a comprehensive framework for understanding these dynamics, the study contributes to developing tailored strategies for fostering a more equitable society.",Sociology
1291,,"America’s COVID-19 pandemic lasted for three years. We look back at the pandemic period and discuss three lessons we learned from it. First, we present figures for the effects of the pandemic on life expectancy. We do this using a new measure, called hybrid life expectancy, which accounts for the duration of the pandemic. We show that the three-year pandemic's effects on life expectancy were around an order of magnitude smaller than previously reported. The second lesson concerns racial/ethnic disparities in the pandemic’s effects on life expectancy. Using hybrid life expectancy, we show that those disparities were never more than 0.2 years, even at age 80. Changes in COVID-19 mortality rates are examined in the third lesson. We show there that in 2021, the year when vaccines first became widely available, the mortality rates fell for non-Hispanic Asians, non-Hispanic Blacks, and Hispanics, but not for non-Hispanic Whites. This behavior of non-Hispanic Whites was a factor in the US’s comparatively large decline in life expectancy between 2020 and 2021.  The paper shows how crucially the pandemic’s effect on life expectancy depends on its duration. Ignoring this duration dependence magnifies racial/ethnic disparities in life expectancy by an order of magnitude, The paper also shows the importance of social and political factors in shaping pandemic outcomes.",Sociology
1292,,"Growing concerns about the detrimental impacts of current academic research assessment practices have prompted a global movement to emerge calling for fundamental reforms. Reform principles calling for holistic evaluation and diversified quality criteria have gained increasing visibility in some countries and regions, coordinated by trans-national and national initiatives. However, rallying collective action on this issue presents significant challenges - both in building a coalition united around a common reform vision and in translating that vision into practice. This paper examines the political dynamics underlying a prominent national research assessment reform initiative - the Dutch Recognition and Rewards program. Through interpretive stakeholder analysis of the initiative's first five years, it highlights the diverse actors that have aligned with or opposed the proposed changes, their roles in the Dutch system, and resources and influences they wield. Crucially, although multiple actors can set the stage for reform, achieving lasting changes will hinge on how widely and enthusiastically the academic community embraces and enacts its guiding principles. The paper concludes with lessons about the strategies, vulnerabilities, and critical dependencies shaping this leading national research assessment reform effort’s development to date and going forwards, and draws out recommendations for similar reform initiatives launching in other countries.",Sociology
1293,,"Existing research has shown that immigrants’ health care use and costs are lower compared to native population. The aim of this study is to analyse 1) how average health care costs differ between newly arrived immigrants and natives in Finland, 2) whether the costs of immigrants converge to the level of natives over time, and 3) how other factors of integration are associated with convergence in health care use. We use individual-level register data on total working-age (18-64) population living in Finland between 2008 and 2017 combined with their health care use and costs in public specialised health care sector from the national Care Register for Health Care. Our analysis sample includes all working-age immigrants who arrived in Finland between 2008-2010 and divided in eight groups by region of origin. We use a 10 per cent random sample of native-born Finns as a comparison group. Information on earlier arrived immigrants is used in additional analyses. We follow the study population’s (n=296,956) health care costs from 2011 to 2017. To illustrate trajectories in health care costs, we employ growth curve models. Our results show that immigrants have lower health care costs compared to natives and they do not converge to the native level over a 7-year observation period. This finding holds also among immigrants who have more local social, cultural, and economic capital. Notably, the costs differ remarkably between sectors of health care, different immigrant groups, and by other factors. However, the determinants of health care costs appear to function relatively similarly among natives and immigrants. Information on these differences is crucial for assessing equity in the distribution of health care. Our results can also be used to improve the accuracy of regional predictions of models that forecast health expenditures at the regional level in Finland. In addition to better health among immigrants, lower health care use and costs among immigrants may indicate, for example, different approaches to health care use or unmet needs due to barriers to accessing health care services. It seems that the ‘healthy immigrant effect’ is an oversimplification of the reality. To make informed policy decisions, future research is needed to uncover the factors behind the lower health care use among immigrants and whether this affects health outcomes and health inequality.",Sociology
1294,,"Families are important sources of social support, yet this support is not available to everyone. Support availability partly depends on the relationships that bind family members together into a family structure. Researchers increasingly analyze such relational structure through a network rather than a household perspective. We identify two issues with this approach: an inattention to the importance of co-residence for support availability and an assumption that family networks do not overlap. We tackle these issues by conceptualizing families as a network of households interconnected at a population scale. Our approach efficiently captures both co-residence patterns and the intergenerational structure of families up to four degrees of separation from a central household. We illustrate the potential of our approach by constructing the ego-networks of 668,190 households with children ages 0-4 using register data from the Netherlands. Through descriptive analysis we reveal significant heterogeneity in family network characteristics, including size, density, relationship composition, and network overlap. Our approach provides a promising framework for studying family structures beyond traditional household and network perspectives.",Sociology

Plithogenic sets, which generalize fuzzy and neutrosophic sets by incorporating multi-attribute and contradictory properties, provide a flexible tool for representing complex systems. To formalize these ideas, we utilize hyperstructures and superhyperstructures, enabling hierarchical and multi-layered relationships. Applications in decision-making and control systems are examined, with a focus on superhyperdecision-making and extending neuro-fuzzy systems to plithogenic systems within superhyperstructure frameworks. Finally, we propose future research directions, such as applying plithogenic sets to lattice theory and blockchain technology, along with integrating superhyperstructures to enhance these fields.",Sociology

better educational opportunities. This study examines the effects of school
mobility from marginal to central areas in Italy, characterized by significant

mobility in the transition to upper secondary education. Using longitudinal
student population data on two cohorts of students, we apply a difference-indifferences
approach to estimate the effect of school mobility from marginal to
central areas between grades 8 and 10 on students’ standardized test scores in
reading and mathematics. In addition, we provide an indirect test of three key
mechanisms highlighted in the literature on school mobility: logistical costs,
change in school quality, and dissolution of social ties. The results show that
mobility to central areas improves academic performance in both Italian reading
and mathematics, with gains of 0.067 and 0.078 standard deviations, respectively.
Importantly, the positive effect is more pronounced for students who move to
higher quality schools and for those who commute shorter distances, while the

Similarly, in social analysis and social sciences, frameworks such as PDCA, DMAIC, SWOT, and OODA have been established to enable structured evaluation and effective problem-solving. Furthermore, in phenomenology and social sciences, various logical systems have been developed to address specific objectives and practical applications. This paper extends these concepts using the Neutrosophic theory, revisiting their mathematical definitions and exploring their properties. The Neutrosophic Set, an extension of the Fuzzy Set, is a highly flexible framework that has been widely studied in fields such as social sciences. By incorporating Neutrosophic Sets, we aim to improve their suitability for programming and mathematical analysis, providing advanced methods to tackle complex, multi-dimensional problems. We hope that this research will inspire further studies and foster the development of practical applications across various related disciplines.",Sociology
1298,,"Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) is offered on a user-pays basis in Australia, with a range of providers and services. A key concern that has been raised in the context of NIPT provision is possible routinization of testing and impacts on informed consent. Given these concerns, a key consideration is the use of documents, such as forms, in the clinical encounter. These forms are frequently used in NIPT provision in Australia, but there is a lack of substantial information or clarity about the function or role that these forms can play in the clinician-patient interaction; some are labelled as “request forms”, others as “consent forms”, others as neither. In this study, our aim was to assess the range of functions that these forms may serve. We performed an online search for forms available from Australian providers, and applied a modified version of the Evaluative Linguistic Framework to a final list of nine forms. Our findings suggest a significant degree of ambiguity in the function of these forms in the context of the clinical encounter, and their role in the performance of informed consent as a clinical ritual. Future research with an ethnographic approach would be beneficial to expand on the findings from this study. These findings can inform the way the clinicians and other (healthcare) professionals approach the clinical encounter in the context of NIPT provision.",Sociology

Existing research points to various internal and external factors contributing to such violations. This research seeks to examine a previously unexplored connection: the potential influence of a CEO's political partisanship and ideology on a company's environmental record. The analysis will use upper echelons theory and the ideology-as-values framework to suggest that the political ideologies of CEOs, specifically their position on the liberal-conservative scale, affect their companies' environmental actions. It is hypothesized that a CEO's political partisanship is positively linked to environmental violations by their firm. The study’s findings provide some evidence that relative CEO partisanship does indicate that firms led by more Republican-leaning CEOs are associated with more EPA violations; with firms headed by conservative leaning CEOs having a higher propensity to be investigated for environmental violations by the EPA.",Sociology
1300,,"The egalitarian principle of justice attributes life success to two main factors: circumstances beyond an individual’s control and personal effort within it. Roemer’s equality of opportunity concept proposes compensating individuals for inequalities arising from unequal circumstances. Dynamic complementarity in skill formation suggests that early childhood skill gaps often persist into adulthood, leading to unequal outcomes. Using PSID data, I classify all measurable factors before age 18 (the age of majority) as circumstances, creating sets based on critical childhood stages to account for dynamic complementarity. My findings show that over 40% of total income inequality can be attributed to inequality of opportunity before adulthood. Moreover, nearly one-third of total income inequality stems from circumstances faced by individuals at or before age five. Using only circumstances identified as important through a random forest—a supervised machine learning model—based on permutation-based importance scores, I estimate the lower bound of inequality of opportunity’s share in total inequality before the age of majority to be about 31%. These results underscore the importance of considering childhood circumstances when measuring inequality of opportunity. This consideration is crucial for any public policy involving ex-post compensation or ex-ante investment in human capital to equalize opportunities.

Here, we outline how the public sphere for science is transforming as media evolve, and we connect these changes to the high-stakes issue context of COVID-19.

This has been apparent in studies of echo chambers and filter bubbles. Producing a more usable evidence base, we conclude, will require that scholars (a) obtain access to proprietary data, (b) reconceptualize information ecologies as social systems, (c) avoid ceding core research tasks to platforms, (d) address ethical issues, and (e) grapple with the urgency of moving forward productively.",Sociology

By structuring the analytical process into clear research phases - from initial coding through to visualisation and expansion - and providing specific prompts and instructions for each phase, the framework enables researchers to systematically harness AI capabilities whilst maintaining the methodological rigour and accountability of the researcher in leading this process. We argue that the framework's strength lies in its careful alignment with established grounded theory processes, particularly in its emphasis on constant comparison throughout all analytical phases. As many grounded theory methods are employed in other qualitative research designs, we argue that the proposed framework may have potential for use in a broad range of designs, however, we also suggest that this is the start of new conversations about how researchers can harness AI to assist their decision making and intellectual work, processes which can never be fully replaced.",Sociology
1303,,"This study compares the size and stratification of motherhood penalties in labour market participation between France and Germany- two countries with contrasting policy regimes regarding maternal employment. France encourages a swift return of mothers to the labour market, whereas Germany does not. Using harmonized administrative data, we analyse labour market trajectories of 24,112 French and 74,258 German women who were employed prior to birth and had their first child between 1997 and 2014. Our results reveal that women with higher pre-birth income, education, and employment in higher-wage firms experience less employment loss in both countries. Among these dimensions, pre-birth income emerges as the strongest stratifying factor when analysed jointly. Motherhood penalties are significantly smaller in France, predicting less than a third of the overall employment reduction found in Germany during the five years after birth. However French penalties are more stratified than across all three dimensions of stratification. For instance, in France, a mother from the lowest income quintile faces a participation reduction that is 3.14 times greater than that of a mother from the highest quintile, whereas in Germany, this ratio is 1.17. Within Germany, East Germany exhibits smaller but more stratified penalties.  Finally, we test if the observed macro-level patterns - where bigger penalties correspond to less stratification - generalize to local labour markets. An analysis of 65 NUTS-2 regions in both countries rejects this hypothesis. These findings suggest that in regimes promoting rapid labour market reintegration, mothers from lower socio-economic backgrounds may face greater challenges.",Sociology
1304,,"This paper revisits the predominant view in the literature suggesting all people perceive income inequality as equally harmful. I argue that while income inequality tends to have negative consequences for the majority, it can be beneficial for those at the upper end of a country’s income distribution. Specifically, people in higher income deciles are likely to experience greater life satisfaction and especially in societies with higher levels of income inequality, where their relative advantage is more pronounced. To explore this, I analyze data from 29 European countries covered in Round 9 (2018) of the European Social Survey. Results employing multi-level modelling reveal an interplay between income inequality and individual income position. While higher income inequality is generally associated with lower life satisfaction, this effect is predominantly observed among people in the lower income brackets. Conversely, those in higher income positions tend to report greater life satisfaction, and this effect is magnified in countries with higher levels of income inequality. These findings suggest that income inequality has a differentiated impact, with the negative consequences largely affecting those at the bottom of the income ladder, while those at the top may benefit. Moreover, men compared to women are tentatively more affected in their life satisfaction by income inequality and their income position. To more accurately predict the relationship between income inequality and people’s life satisfaction, future research should consider the varying experiences of different income groups, particularly focusing on who benefits and who is disadvantaged in unequal societies.",Sociology
1305,,"Background:
Beyond the public health challenges it posed, the COVID-19 pandemic exposed the fragility of public discourses, particularly regarding moral key terms such as freedom. Understanding how these terms, including freedom, are used across different forms of public communication is critical for promoting an informed dialogue during crises and reducing societal polarization.
Objective:
This study aims to explore the usage of the key moral term freedom within public discourses in Switzerland. It examines the terms’ framing in official press releases, newspapers, and social media to map its usage, identifying discrepancies in the construction of its meaning. The results of this study could aid policymakers in the design of strategies for improving clarity and consistency in public reasoning, and reduce polarization in public discourses.
Methods:
We analyzed three datasets with a NLP pipeline comprising lemmatization, co-occurrence analysis, and semantic network mapping: official press releases from the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health (BAG), newspaper articles from major outlets retrieved via Factiva, and social media posts collected via CrowdTangle. 
Results:
The analysis revealed notable differences in how freedom was framed across datasets. Government press releases emphasized the need to balance public health responsibilities with personal autonomy, while newspapers highlighted the tension between restrictions and civil liberties.  Social media discourse was marked by polarized views, with prominent themes of activism, distrust in authorities, and debates over individual versus collective freedoms.
Conclusions:
The conceptualizations of freedom emerging from the data reflect tensions between individual rights and collective responsibilities during the pandemic. Inconsistent framing across different contexts likely contributed to societal polarization and institutional distrust. The study highlights the need for clearer communication and shared understanding of key moral terms such as freedom, which could help strengthen democratic processes and institutions.",Sociology
1306,,"The employment trajectories of mothers around childbirth differ within and
between European countries, with implications for long-term attachment to the
labor market. Existing research has focused mainly on comparing employment
status before and after birth, without too much attention to the process between.
This paper describes how this critical juncture in employment trajectories plays
out in the first 24 months after a child is born in 20 European countries. Us-
ing micro-level data from the EU-SILC, we identify nine typical patterns around
childbirth, covering a period of 10 months prior to birth until 24 months after.
Although five of these patterns are stable, the remaining four reveal substantial
and sustained turbulence. This affects about 33% of all mothers within our sam-
ple. We further find a considerable educational gradient for membership in each
pattern. Highly educated mothers are twice as likely as low educated mothers to
experience a turbulent post-birth period of employment that results in part-time
employment. By contrast and additional to significantly lower baseline levels of
employment, lower educated mothers are more likely to exhibit turbulence re-
flecting intermittent employment. On the country level, we find large differences
in the within-country heterogeneity of likely employment patterns, and levels of
post birth turbulence. Additionally, we find a distinct set of clusters representing
long and stable leave usage in some specific Eastern European countries.",Sociology

Supporting them in this requires a clear understanding of how they experience their online world. Therefore, this study examined preadolescents’ online activities and their perceptions of online opportunities and challenges using qualitative methods. In a participatory project, 129 preadolescents explored their online world with interactive activities. An inductive thematic analysis was conducted on the verbatim transcripts of the audio-recorded sessions and photographs of the work created during sessions. The results provided nuanced and in-depth insights into preadolescents’ online activities, opportunities, and challenges, illustrating the complex and ever-evolving nature of their online world. Furthermore, the findings highlighted the importance of preadolescents’ social environment in shaping their perceptions of the online world. This study underscores the need for additional research involving preadolescents to better understand what they need to thrive in today’s digital media society.",Sociology
1308,,"This study examines the relationship between emergency measures that violate democratic norms, the effectiveness of these measures, and citizens' perceptions of democratic quality during the COVID-19 pandemic. The challenge decision-makers face during emergencies is that while a decision to prioritize public health goals over libertarian values may strengthen output legitimacy of governments and political systems, the same policies can be interpreted as a weakening of the quality of democracy. In the study, we categorize the most common mitigation measures according to whether they challenge vertical, horizontal or diagonal accountability. Utilizing a conjoint experiment completed by 1,000 individuals in Hungary, we explore whether citizens are open to trade-offs between the violation of democratic norms and public health and economic performance outcomes. We find that the effectiveness of emergency measures and economic performance stands out as the two most important indicators of democratic quality for respondents suggesting a seeming prioritization of tangible outcomes over procedural considerations during a crisis. The results of our trade-off analysis reveal notwithstanding that while the preference for output legitimacy over input and throughput legitimacy is possible, such decisions by citizens may be temporal and selective, and dependent on the severity of the crisis for which a state of emergency is declared.",Sociology
1309,,"China has experienced a remarkable rise in living standards over four decades of economic reforms, alongside a tremendous increase in inequalities. In this context, do Chinese people support redistribution of wealth gained through reform windfalls? To answer this question, we conducted an online survey experiment with a nationally representative sample from China (N = 2,000). The treatment group was shown examples of wealth acquired through typical reform-era pathways requiring minimal ability or effort. This exposure led to a 0.1 standard deviation decrease in their support for redistribution. We propose a “reform windfall as redistribution” mechanism to explain this reduction: the treated group perceives the reform era as inherently redistributive, providing opportunities to escape systemic inequalities tied to the political system, thereby reducing the perceived need for formal redistribution. This decline in support is not driven by changes in fairness perceptions, as respondents do not attribute the wealth acquisition scenarios to ability or effort, nor do they view them as distinctly fair or unfair. Furthermore, we find limited evidence of heterogeneity, with one exception: individuals reporting higher economic pressure show an even greater reduction in redistributive support when exposed to the treatment. We hypothesize that this occurs because unmet expectations for upward mobility exacerbate their reactions to the treatment scenarios.

1311,,"It would be hard to argue that participatory design approaches to technological development of products and services for people with disabilities have been under-utilized, if not neglected (Frauenberger, 2015; Benton and Johnson, 2015).  This can be attributed to the fact that in the past, decisions related to the design and development were generally influenced by designers rather than the people with disabilities who were the end-users.  However, user involvement in the design/creation of products and services, has been evolving over time and the role of the users has changed: from influencers of just the final outcome to influencers of the development and design process; from being tasked with the standardization of products/ outcomes to being actively involved in their customization to meet individuals’ needs and preferences; from, more recently, mere participants to having a relationship with the designers/developers. This more bottom-up approach increases the inclusion of the main stakeholders (people with disabilities) in the decision-making process and makes their role more visible and prominent. They are in direct dialogue with the “experts” (researchers, designers, developers, innovators etc.), which empowers a more ethical and sustainable innovation process that leads to more desirable outcomes. Those are the main principles of Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI), which seeks to involve society in framing the discussion around the ways science and technology can improve the world for the next generations.

1313,,"A substantial body of research has demonstrated that news media often present a skewed portrayal of society, particularly with respect to gender. This distorted picture manifests in two main ways : a persistent gap in the exposure of men and women in media content, and the perpetuation of entrenched gender stereotypes in the same content. However, the long-term evolution of these gender disparities in the media remains largely unexplored, primarily due to the lack of accessible, diachronic corpora and the methodological divide between the study of exposure gaps and that of stereotypes. This article addresses these challenges by (a) introducing new, generalizable measures to assess gender disparities in media representation, covering both exposure and stereotypes, and (b) applying these measures to a comprehensive dataset of 3.2 million articles, 13.9 million mentions, and 3.7 million citations from Le Monde, France's leading highbrow newspaper, spanning the years 1944 to 2024. According to our results, while men still dominate the content produced by Le Monde, their share of mentions has decreased from 94% to 74%, and their share of quotes from 98% to 76%. This decline in the masculinity of news has accelerated since 2016 across most news sections except Sports, and in particular in Society and Culture articles. The rise of female journalists in Le Monde’s newsroom (reaching 47% at the end of the studied period) contributes to this trend, as women journalists tend to mention and quote more women than male journalists, increasingly so since 2010. However, despite these shifts, our results show that the stereotyping of both men and women mentioned or quoted in Le Monde, which had steadily decreased from 1945 to 2010, has remained stable since then. This suggests that the recent decrease in the content masculinity has not resulted in more equal treatment of men and women in Le Monde.",Sociology

Leveraging a comprehensive dataset of 2,125,180 historical individuals from Wikidata, the analysis quantifies name uniqueness across Europe and North America between 1500 and 1900. In Study 1, the validity of Wikidata for name uniqueness analysis is established by replicating trends observed in national registers, utilizing a novel method for calculating name uniqueness. Study 2 explores temporal changes in name uniqueness and its association with economic development, revealing a significant positive correlation over this period. Study 3 extends the analysis globally, combining data from the World Values Survey to show a robust relationship between name uniqueness and self-reported individualism across 40 countries. Together, these findings align with qualitative historical research, demonstrating that individuals have become increasingly individualistic and autonomous in the modern era. This trend is evident across all studied European countries, supporting modernization theory and highlighting the global link between economic development and the rise of individualism.",Sociology

While the literature on degrowth has grown exponentially, there is limited analysis of how reviews in this field synthesise and advance knowledge. Critics argue that degrowth research lacks rigorous methodologies, reflecting the limitations of orthodox economic frameworks in conceptualising alternatives to growth. This systematic review protocol aims to map the intellectual landscape of degrowth and post-growth literature, evaluate the methodological quality of existing reviews, and assess their contribution to understanding social-ecological transformation. Methods: We will systematically synthesise degrowth and post-growth literature reviews using best-practice frameworks for the conduct and reporting of umbrella reviews. Searches will be conducted across multiple bibliographic databases, including Web of Science Core Collections, Scopus, and The Lens, as well as grey literature sources, using tailored and tested search strings. Inclusion criteria focus on reviews with explicit methodologies addressing degrowth and post-growth topics. Screening will involve title/abstract and full-text assessments against predefined inclusion criteria, with checks among reviewers to ensure consistency. Data extraction will encompass philosophical, theoretical, and methodological attributes of included studies. Critical appraisal will employ the CEESAT tool to evaluate review validity. The synthesis will provide a meta-level understanding of review frameworks, highlighting strengths, limitations, and opportunities for advancing degrowth scholarship. By rigorously mapping and appraising the evidence base, this review aims to support researchers, policymakers, and activists in navigating and applying degrowth knowledge to achieve meaningful socio-ecological transformations.",Sociology

This study examines how changes to present circumstances influence retrospective reports of family income rank at age 16. While retrospective survey data can be used to assess the long-term effects of childhood conditions, present-day circumstances may “anchor” memories, causing shifts in how individuals recall and report past experiences. Using panel data from the 2006-2014 General Social Surveys (8,602 observations from 2,883 individuals in the United States), we analyze how changes in objective and subjective indicators of current social status—income, financial satisfaction, and perceived income relative to others—are associated with changes in reports of childhood income rank. Fixed-effects models reveal no significant association between changes in income and in childhood income rank. However, changes in subjective measures of social status show contrasting effects: childhood income rank is negatively associated with financial satisfaction but positively associated with perceived relative income. We argue these contrasting effects follow based on theories of anchoring in recall bias. We further find these effects are stronger among males but are consistent across racial/ethnic groups. Our findings highlight the malleability of retrospective perceptions and their sensitivity to current social conditions, offering methodological insights into survey reliability and recall bias.",Sociology

1319,,"Purpose: It is not possible to understand working-age welfare without considering mental health – yet we have surprisingly little detailed quantitative information exploring this. We aim to quantify mental ill-health among British claimants, the extent of conditionality/sanctions, and perceptions of unreasonable conditionality. 

Methods: A purpose-collected survey of working-age claimants in May/June 2022 (3,801) using YouGov’s online panel, accompanied by general public comparator surveys. Mental ill-health was captured using a mixture of clinically-validated screening tools (GAD-7, PHQ-9) and self-reports (of conditions, disability, work limitations).

Results: Levels of mental ill-health are extremely high among claimants. 72.6% [70.7-74.4%] say they are currently affected by a mental health condition, 61.2% [59.2-63.2%] show moderate/severe depression or anxiety using clinically-validated screening tools – both around twice the level of the general public. We then focus on the 49.5% [47.5-51.5%]) of claimants who reported life-limiting mental ill-health (‘mental health disability’). Some such claimants are subject to conditionality/sanctions, but this is noticeably lower than among other claimants (e.g. after adjustment, they are -10.5% [-14.9 to -6.2%] less likely to be subject to intensive conditionality). Of those claimants who were subject to conditionality, most felt conditionality harmed their mental health (59.0% [48.-69.9%]). Substantial minorities also felt that their Work Coach did not act on disclosed barriers (24.3% [17.1-31.5%]), and that conditionality was unreasonable (23.1% [16.1-30.1%]). 

Conclusion: Today, most benefit claimants with mental health disabilities in non-working households are not subject to conditionality. Nevertheless, there are several reasons to be concerned that UK work-related conditionality functions inadequately for claimants experiencing mental ill-health.",Sociology
1320,,"Programme-level data suggests that increasing numbers of claimants are subject to work-related behavioural requirements in countries like the UK. Likewise, academic qualitative research has suggested that conditionality is pervasive within the benefits system, and often felt to be unreasonable. However, there is little quantitative evidence on the extent or experience of conditionality from claimants’ perspectives. We fill this gap drawing on a purpose-collected survey of UK benefit claimants (n=3,801). We find the stated application of conditionality was evident for a surprisingly small proportion of survey participants – even lower than programme-level data suggest. Unreasonable conditionality was perceived by many of those subject to conditionality but not a majority, with e.g. 26.2% believing that work coaches do not fully take health/care-related barriers into account. Yet alongside this, a substantial minority of claimants (22.4%) not currently subject to conditionality report that conditionality has negatively affected their mental health. We argue that reconciling this complex set of evidence requires a more nuanced understanding of conditionality, which is alert to methodological assumptions, the role of time and implementation, and the need to go beyond explicit requirements to consider implicit forms of conditionality. Concluding, we recommend a deeper mixed-methods agenda for conditionality research.",Sociology

1322,,"Perfectionism is linked to elevated all-or-nothing (dichotomous) thinking, reduced self-evaluations (e.g., self-compassion, self-efficacy), and behavioural avoidance. This paper reviews the clinical model of perfectionism and the literature on the connections between perfectionism, self-related constructs such as self-compassion and self-efficacy, and pro-environmental behaviour. It introduces the ‘perfectionistic model of pro-environmental behaviour.’ In an initial test of the model, we explore the associations between perfectionism, dichotomous thinking, self-evaluative constructs and the stated frequency of different types of pro-environmental behaviours. The sample comprised of 344 participants (Mean age = 43.66; SD = 13.01). Our findings reveal that perfectionistic concerns (self-criticism about making mistakes) and perfectionistic strivings (setting high personal standards) exert opposing effects on the reported frequency of difficult pro-environmental behaviours. Specifically, perfectionistic concerns are associated with decreased frequency, while perfectionistic strivings are linked to increased frequency of difficult pro-environmental behaviours. Dichotomous thinking negatively correlates with the frequency of difficult pro-environmental behaviour. Both perfectionistic concerns and strivings indirectly influence pro-environmental behaviour frequency through dichotomous thinking. This study suggests that future longitudinal research should examine if heightened perfectionism leads to increased dichotomous thinking, resulting in decreased frequency of pro-environmental behaviour over time. Given the negative association between dichotomous thinking and the frequency of difficult pro-environmental behaviours, future research could explore whether continuous framing of pro-environmental behaviour yields better overall improvement compared to binary framing in an experimental study.",Sociology
1323,,"Targeting policies to promote a rapid and significant acceleration of low-carbon transitions entails several barriers and challenges that are inextricably tied to existing inequalities and may reinforce or even create new forms of inequity. In this comprehensive systematic literature review, we analyze conceptual and empirical contributions on justice and equity in the fields of energy and mobility transition research. The main task is to summarize, organize and integrate the vast body of ever-increasing knowledge to critically strengthen future research and policy engagement toward a more socially just and low-carbon society. Our findings confirm the predominance of the triumvirate of tenets — distributive, procedural, and recognition – while newer justice dimensions such as restorative, intergenerational, spatial justice, and intersectional perspectives are gaining increasing attention. A specific analysis of authorship structures highlights the hegemony of knowledge production networks centered on individual key authors, mostly affiliated with institutions of the Global North. The gap between Global North and Global South is further demonstrated by a highly unbalanced overrepresentation of geographical research activities, and a different prioritization of justice subjects and concerns. Conceptualizations of justice based on non-Western ontologies or linked to de- and post-colonial perspectives remain largely disregarded. Consequently, we suggest that future transition research should address the implications of meta-conceptual perspectives and the potential of post-normal science and whole systems perspectives. To further explore root causes, we also call for recognizing the structural conditions of (in)justice, politicizing the ontology of technology, and pluralizing perspectives by emphasizing decolonial thought and epistemic justice. Recognizing that justice is a multi-faceted and essentially contested concept, we provide an integrated framework that enables researchers and practitioners to reflect on the potential impacts of energy and mobility transitions, political strategies and other societal interventions. The Spatio-temporal, Holistic and Inclusive Framework for Transition (SHIFT) is based on a critical social science perspective and features a holistic and inclusive approach for evaluating and guiding transition policies in the energy and mobility sector.",Sociology
1324,,"There are calls to better incorporate humans into Earth system models. Some have attempted this using the concept of ‘carrying capacity’. But the concept of carrying capacity has been subject to forceful critique, as it vastly simplifies the many complex factors which affect human populations. This includes factors related to human behaviour, which is so unpredictable that it seems to resist formalisation altogether. Nevertheless, I suggest that the usefulness of a simplified concept like ‘carrying capacity’ depends on the purposes for which it is used. In toy models intended to elucidate a complex phenomenon, a simplified concept might indeed be useful. On the other hand, in forecast models intended for theory testing, a more complex concept may better approximate observed reality. I illustrate this point by looking at two recent toy models which use the concept of carrying capacity to elucidate idealised population dynamics, and at a series of forecast models which instead aim to estimate the population density of real groups in real conditions. In short, the usefulness of concepts depends on modelling choices, which in turn depend upon the purpose for which a given model has been constructed.",Sociology

However, there is little understanding of why and how archaeology has a positive impact. Adopting an interpretative qualitative approach, we interviewed five UK veterans and four providers of UK projects about their experiences of archaeology. Through thematic analysis, three themes were created 1) connection and belonging, 2) authenticity and purpose, and 3) meaning-making through the past.

Background: Since the 1960s, the birth control pill as most prominent form of hormonal contraception has shaped women’s reproductive autonomy, influencing family planning and career choices. Recent trends show a decline in hormonal contraceptive use in Western countries, but research has largely relied on cross-sectional data, leaving it unclear whether this trend reflects short-term period effects or broader cohort-driven changes.
Method: Using longitudinal data from the German Family Panel (pairfam; waves 1-14), this study applies supervised machine learning to identify potential predictors of hormonal contraceptive use. 37 predictors were included, encompassing areas of family demography, gender role values, health, origin, personality, region, religiosity, and socioeconomic characteristics.
Results: The analyses showed a decline in hormonal contraceptive use across all birth cohorts over time. Both cohort and period differences shaped the key predictors of hormonal contraceptive use. Predictors shifted from family-demographic factors in older cohorts to personality traits in younger ones, highlighting increasingly personalized decision-making. The relevance of income underscored the economic dimension of access to contraception. 
Conclusion: These shifts reflect evolving dynamics in contraceptive use, with implications for public health strategies and policymaking.",Sociology
1327,,"The article contributes to the emerging literature on law and infrastructure by first noting that ‘the 
modern infrastructure ideal’ has become less relevant even in the global North, since rather than large connected networks of public utilities, public transit and other welfare-state systems taken as world leaders in many global North countries, infrastructure appears to us in the global North as a series of disconnected ‘projects’. Part of the reason for this curious appearance is that each large project often has its own credit rating and issues its own bonds.
The article, which does not separate the material from the social and the legal, demonstrates that do-it-yourself or informal, inexpensive infrastructure solutions, many of which have arisen in the global 
South, might present a better, more timely goal for infrastructure governance than lamenting the 
absence of financing for major infrastructure projects of the ‘seeing like a state’ era.
The article also challenges the naïve view of law held by many, which holds that the ‘secret’ of 
infrastructure projects is to be found in the details of the contracts awarded, which are often withheld from the public pending Freedom of Information requests. Contracts, it is argued, are only one of the dimensions of infrastructure planning and governance – along with financing and along with representations, often of future services or buildings that do not yet exist.",Sociology

We focus on whether online dating app users are homophilic in terms of the desirability of whom they pursue. Using data from a Czech online dating app, we construct directed two-mode networks where nodes represent users, ties represent messages expressing interest (“swipes”), and desirability is measured by the number of “swipes” each node receives. Using network measures and conditional uniform graph tests extended to directed two-mode networks, we find that the structure of the networks is considerably hierarchical. Women are in advantageous position on the app due to the uneven gender ratio and their substantially higher desirability. The results further show that men pursue women who are more desirable than themselves. The reciprocated contacts are comparatively more homophilic. These results suggest that in terms of desirability, the similarity of partners is due to the subsequent mating processes (e.g., rejection) rather than due to initial preference for similarity.",Sociology
1329,,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is becoming increasingly influential, raising both high hopes and severe concerns. This implies the existence of individually diverse attitudes, which makes AI attitude an important scientific construct.

Building on a review of existing scales, we used Item Response Theory to develop the General Artificial Intelligence Attitude Item Pool (GAIA-I). Using an online questionnaire, we validated both GAIA tools with a sample of 302 participants from the USA. We found evidence for convergent validity (alignment with existing AI attitude scales), discriminant validity (distinction from the constructs AI anxiety and innovativeness), as well as predictive validity (relation to AI usage behavior in a follow-up survey). In contrast to classical scales, our approach allows users to draw individualized scales from a pool of validated items that can be extended and adapted to AI developments in the future without the need to develop a new scale.

Using geo-referenced administrative data from Germany and a conditional instrumental variable approach that exploits distances between place of residence and large firms, we find negative income consequences for dropping out of vocational training but show that the penalty is entirely concentrated among individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds. We further show that these stratified scars partially reflect unequal vocational re-enrolment rates and unequal employment outcomes among dropouts who do not re-enroll. Our results indicate a great potential of policies targeting higher graduation rates to reduce social inequality in labor markets. Furthermore, our study suggests that social origins are important moderators of linkage strength between school and work even in institutional settings with strong links between credentials and the labor market.",Sociology
1331,,"This paper examines Brexit's impact on Japanese foreign direct investment (FDI) in the UK, with a specific focus on affiliate exit and divestment. Utilizing Toyo Keizai Inc.'s Overseas Japanese Companies Data spanning 2010--2020, the study employs a difference-in-differences (DiD) estimation approach and synthetic DiD approach to compare Japanese affiliates' exit and divestment in the UK to affiliates located in other EU nations. Contrary to widespread expectations of a mass exodus of Japanese firms from the UK post-Brexit, the study reveals no statistically significant impact of Brexit on either Japanese affiliate exit or divestment. This finding challenges a prevailing narrative surrounding Brexit's detrimental effects on foreign investment in the UK. The observed resilience of Japanese affiliates is likely attributable to FDI hysteresis effects, arising from the substantial fixed and sunk costs inherent in FDI. These costs create a strong incentive for firms to maintain existing operations even in the face of political and economic uncertainty.",Sociology
1332,,"This research note examines the potential of ChatGPT’s large language model for qualitative symbolic interactionist analysis of social media datasets. Using a small sample of 15 posts on mental health issues from the social media platform Reddit, we explore how large language models interpret, organize, and communicate information based on researchers’ prompts. Prompting itself is a process in which researchers provide both a definition of the situation and of relevant identities for a GPT to assume, which directly shape its interpretive capacity and output. We compare ChatGPT-4o, the latest personal subscription version available at the time of writing, and Microsoft AutoGen, a more powerful API version capable of organizing multiple GPT agents to complete research tasks semi-autonomously. We describe and evaluate the structure and content of each model’s output, including how they engage with data thematically, empirically, and conceptually. We also highlight differences in depth and coherence of their analyses. We show how changes to prompts influenced the GPTs’ interpretative actions, yielding both expected and novel analytical insights. Our preliminary findings suggest that GPTs hold promise for advancing qualitative analysis of big data, albeit with some limitations in analytic depth and occasional hallucination errors. The study contributes to nascent symbolic interactionist scholarship on nonhuman agents in qualitative research, positioning GPTs as semi-autonomous research collaborators.",Sociology
1333,,"Physical activity (PA) is a key predictor of many health outcomes, especially for aging populations. The accurate measurement of PA is key to identifying determinants of health and developing appropriate interventions. To measure PA, many studies use self-reports which are usually limited to global measures and can suffer from measurement error. More fine-grained day-reconstruction methods are burdensome for respondents and prone to recall error. As an alternative, researchers are providing study participants with wearable devices that passively track PA, which reduces reactivity and recall error. However, participants’ non-compliance and high device costs are problematic. Many older adults now have smartphones that track physical activity, and individuals can share these passively collected physical activity data with researchers. We test a data donation approach among older adults. Based on legal requirements (e.g., the EU General Data Protection Regulation), data controllers (i.e., social media platforms, health apps, etc.) must provide users access to all their data in a machine-readable format. We study (1) how willing and successful older adults are to donate their PA data from different smartphone apps; (2) what drives donation of PA data at the different stages of participation; and (3) what biases arises from selective data donation? We use a privacy-preserving data donation tool integrated in a probability-based online panel of the Dutch general population to collect PA data from various health apps. 2,086 members of the LISS panel aged 50 years and older completed a web survey in early 2024. All iPhone and Android smartphone owners were asked to download passively collected PA data from their devices (Apple Health, Google Location History, or Samsung Health) and donate them via the Port platform. Out of the 2,086 survey participants, 1,889 (91%) reported owning an iPhone or Android phone compatible for data donation, 606 (29%) reported being willing to donation their PA data, 354 (17%) started the data donation, and 256 (12%) successfully provided a data package. Gender, age, educational attainment, income, and smartphone ownership and usage behavior, privacy related attitudes, and type of health app from which the data were requested correlated with behavior at the different stages of study participation. Compared to the entire sample, older adults who successfully data donors reported higher levels of self-rated health, fewer health-related limitations, fewer difficulties performing everyday activities, and more physical activity. Our study shows that data donation from smartphones as part of a probability-based web survey of older adults is a feasible alternative for the measurement of PA. Nonparticipation correlates strongly with characteristics related to smartphone ownership and comfort with device use. However, substantive bias in health and PA outcomes persist for those who donated in comparison to all survey respondents.",Sociology
1334,,"This study employs large language models (LLMs), K-means clustering, and propensity score matching to thoroughly examine the impact of regional marketization on labor market segmentation and university graduates’ sectoral choices. The findings reveal that regional variations in marketization levels lead to heterogeneity in the ownership composition of the primary labor market, resulting in different labor market segmentation structures. In southeastern coastal and metropolitan regions, the abundance of high-quality private-sector job opportunities makes the traditional “public-private” dichotomy insufficient for accurately describing the two-tiered labor market, thus challenging prevailing academic assumptions.
Due to variations in local marketization levels, university graduates across regions exhibit divergent preferences for public and private sector employment. Moreover, limited job availability creates a complex sectoral choice pattern. Specifically, in inland provinces and smaller cities, individuals with higher human capital are more likely to enter the public sector, while no significant correlation is found in southeastern coastal and metropolitan regions.",Sociology
1335,,"Over the past half-century, higher education expansion and changing gender imbalances in 
education have reshaped the educational composition of the partner market. Nonetheless, the 
impact of these concurrent trends on educational sorting in unions and marriages remains 
unclear. Using data from France (1962–2011) and US (1960–2015), we examine how (a) 
educational expansion and (b) the changing gender-education association contributed to 
changing sorting outcomes in marital and non-marital different-sex unions. Counterfactual 
decomposition techniques revealed two main trends. First, the changing gender-education 
association – apart from educational upgrading – has promoted rising hypogamy (she is more 
educated than he) and declining hypergamy (he is more educated than she). Second, 
educational expansion is associated with rising proportions of homogamous, hypogamous, and 
hypergamous unions involving more educated individuals and declines in these union types 
with less educated women and men. However, the impact of these changes on overall 
homogamy and heterogamy trends differs across countries. For example, while the increasing 
supply of highly educated individuals has promoted hypogamy in France it has offset 
hypogamy in the United States. Our findings contribute to ongoing debates about the structural 
effects of educational expansion and the reversing gender imbalance in education on the 
formation of different-sex unions.",Sociology
1336,,"We examine the enforcement of two pillars of colonial rule in French West Africa, military conscription and head tax collection, using novel district-level data from 1919 to 1949. Colonial states are often characterized as either omnipotent Leviathans or administration on the cheap. Our findings reveal their notable coerciveness in achieving key objectives. Military recruitment targets were consistently met, even amid individual avoidance and poor health conditions, by drawing on a pool of eligible fit young men. Tax compliance was similarly high, with approximately 80% of the liable population meeting obligations. Spikes in head tax rates significantly increased tax-related protests, likely prompting caution among colonial administrators. The tax burden was adjusted according to perceived district affluence, and tax moderation was applied in times of crisis. However, local shocks such as droughts or cash crop price collapses were largely ignored. These results underscore the capacity of colonial states to enforce their authority despite limited policy responsiveness, offering new insights into the political economy of colonial governance.

Earlier evidence suggests that certain features of the survey instrument provide more ground for interviewer influence. For instance, attitudinal, sensitive, complex or open-ended questions invite more interviewer variance. In this paper, we aim to validate earlier results, previously derived from single-country studies, by using the large cross-national sample of the European Social Survey. We compare 31,270 intraclass-correlations (ICCs) derived from 1004 survey questions from 28 countries using data from 10 waves of the ESS. The questions were manually coded based on several characteristics. These features of survey questions were then used as predictors of ICCs in multilevel models. The results show that question characteristics account for a significant portion of the variation in ICCs, with certain types, such as attitude and non-factual questions, items appearing later in the survey, and those using showcards, being especially susceptible to interviewer effects. Our findings have important implications for both interviewer training and questionnaire design.",Sociology

In order to do so, educational practitioners, policy makers, and researchers need tools to monitor efforts made. We posit that a comprehensive approach to teaching for sustainability adds quality to education for sustainability. The current study builds on earlier theoretic work on quality education for sustainability teaching (QUEST), aiming to 1) initiate the development of an assessment instrument for monitoring the quality of sustainability teaching based on the perspective of those who the education aims to empower, i.e., the students and 2) contribute to further theory development. To this end, the QUEST-framework was developed into a set of five scales that tap into students’ perspective on the content (or what, i.e., relevant holistic knowledge and sustainability competencies), educational approach (or how, i.e., a pluralistic and action-oriented teaching approach), partners and locations (where and with whom) of teaching and learning. The five scales together build a questionnaire instrument to monitor quality education for sustainability teaching (QUEST-Q). Think aloud protocols and interviews with students and teachers support the cognitive and content validity of the scales. Reliability and construct validity were verified, with all scales showing acceptable model fit. Results are discussed in light of advancing theory and providing avenues for future research. We offer practitioners, policy makers, and researchers the QUEST-Q to monitor students’ experiences of quality education to support a sustainable future.",Sociology

1342,,"Rising economic inequality across rich countries has raised questions about whether family background increasingly determines children’s economic success. However, prior research has not addressed whether family background is of differential importance for children who end up in the top, middle, or bottom of the earnings spectrum and whether this has changed across birth cohorts. Using administrative data from Norway, we study cohort trends in sibling correlations across children’s earnings distribution for men and women born from the early 1950s up to 1980. By decomposing sibling correlations, we assess the extent to which these trends are accounted for by observed parental socioeconomic characteristics relative to unobserved family background factors. Our results reveal a modest rise in the influence of family background on average earnings and in the middle of the earnings distribution for both genders, but this trend hides important variation across the distribution. For men, we find a strong increase in the influence of family background on children’s risk of falling to the bottom of the earnings distribution, while sibling correlations for attainment of top earnings have declined over time. Moreover, unobserved family background factors are increasingly important for predicting men’s adult economic disadvantage. For women, sibling correlations have risen across cohorts except at the top of the earnings distribution, and the relative role of observed parental socioeconomic characteristics has increased. These results underscore the complexity of intergenerational trends in the influence of family background, indicating that rising economic inequality does not uniformly lead to reduced mobility but varies significantly across different earnings levels and between genders",Sociology
1343,,"Historical estimates of the total fertility rate (TFR) are relatively uncommon, owing to the onerous data requirements for direct calculation and the lack of digitized records. Recent advancements in indirect fertility estimation 1 allow for estimation of TFR using data as minimal as a population pyramid – relatively common data in historical contexts through census records and population registers. Here we use published data on the age structure of Roman Egypt circa AD 12 to AD 259 2 to estimate TFR and 90%ile credible interval in an ancient time period and place using a Bayesian approach. Furthermore, the population data is separated by urban and rural areas, allowing for an unprecedented glimpse into ancient fertility levels. We find that ancient Roman Egyptian women in urban areas had considerably lower fertility than women in rural areas -- urban TFR: 3.37 [2.26 – 4.55], and rural TFR: 8.57 [6.01 – 11.25]. Our findings suggest that the modern day urban/rural fertility differential dates back nearly 2000 years. As demonstrated here, the advancements in indirect estimation could be deployed to better understand historical and ancient fertility regimes, shedding light on societies far before the existence of modern vital statistics systems.",Sociology

Assignment of responsibility for carbon emissions typically differentiates emissions across space and time but not birth cohort. Including young birth cohorts complicates assessments as they have yet to emit as much as older cohorts. Using formal demographic methods, we develop an approach to estimate carbon emissions across space, across time, and across the life course, creating a unified carbon emissions identity, comparable to other well-known carbon identities. We estimate the birth cohorts born between 1850 and 2020 with the highest lifetime carbon emissions. We show that globally, cohorts born between 1970 and 1990 have the highest lifetime emissions under a moderate carbon emissions pathway and those born since 2000 under a high emissions pathway. Our results suggest that carbon emissions pathways play the strongest role in determining which cohorts will be associated with the highest lifetime carbon emissions, with lower pathways suggesting earlier cohorts and higher pathways suggesting later cohorts.",Sociology

1346,,"Modernization theory posed gender ideology as a unidimensional continuum ranging from “traditional” to egalitarian with egalitarianism increasing as societies progress. Recent research replaces a unidimensional view with multidimensionality, but other modernization remnants remain. We tackle such remnants by examining gender ideologies and their socioeconomic correlates in Tamil Nadu, an Indian context often labeled “traditional.” Using latent class analysis of 10 gender attitudes from the South Indian Community Health Study (SICHS), we identify six gender ideologies. Two ideologies are consistently egalitarian or essentialist, two are mixed, and two are characterized by ambivalent agreement. Attitudes toward mobility are a crucial divider; moderate support for equal mobility distinguishes “consistent egalitarians” from “seclusionist egalitarians” and “agreeable seclusionists” from the “highly agreeable.” These agreeable ideologies likely reflect acquiescence bias, but may also signal polite resistance to feminist scripts. The gender ideologies are correlated with gender, religion, and education, but have little to no association with caste, age, and class. These findings extend the multidimensionality of gender ideology to an Indian context and hint at the power of global and local cultural scripts. More broadly, they demonstrate the value – and challenges – of building a more global understanding of gender ideology freer of modernization remnants.",Sociology

However, sociologists whose research center immigrants' experiences in these countries find that they are never fully perceived as ""national"" because of their ancestry. Using a pre-registered, nationally representative, novel conjoint experiment fielded in 5 different countries, I find that natives' understanding of who belongs in the nation might be understood as ""colorblind ethnocentrism"": while people espouse civic normative understandings of the nation, they draw symbolic boundaries of national belonging based on ancestry. Moreover, when respondents do express a normative preference for ancestry in survey measures, it translates to a revealed preference for white and Christian members of the nation. Finally, in Europe (outside the UK), people imagine the nation as White, while this is not the case in the US and the UK overall. These findings help us understand why nativist discourse can easily take hold in liberal democracies, despite people's explicit disavowal of such discourse.",Sociology

Relations refer to effects of interpersonal and interorganizational networks while institutions refer to norms that influence isomorphism and dynamism. Professions feature psychological factors affecting performance and sociological factors shaping work and occupations. Transformation refers to episodic and continuous changes while social conflict foregrounds power, inequalities, and competition over resources. I map how these perspectives are connected with each other and also suggest future directions in the field by intersecting organizational theory with studies of new technologies, historic organizations, global interconnections, marginalized populations, political institutions, and larger societal consequences.",Sociology

Through a comprehensive historical analysis, the study traces the development of a unique French model of cinema support, characterized by robust state involvement, selective funding mechanisms, and a commitment to cultural diversity. The research demonstrates how the French state has progressively transformed its approach to cinema, from initial regulatory and taxation strategies to sophisticated support systems like the ‘Avance sur Recettes’ (Advance on Receipts). Key turning points include the Blum-Byrnes agreements of 1948, Jack Lang's cultural policies in the 1980s, and the ongoing challenges posed by digital technologies and global streaming platforms in the 2000s. The analysis reveals the tension between commercial imperatives and artistic quality, highlighting how state interventions have sought to preserve a distinctive French cinematic identity. By examining policy documents, parliamentary reports, and critical debates, the paper illuminates the complex negotiations between economic sustainability, cultural expression, and national prestige in French film policy. Ultimately, regarding the recent France 2030 Plan, the study argues that French cinema policy represents a unique model of cultural intervention, balancing economic pragmatism with a profound commitment to artistic innovation and cultural sovereignty.",Sociology

1356,,"Autocrats often use legal repression to criminalize opposition organizations, targeting both domestic and exile groups to suppress dissent. While such measures may weaken cooperation with these organizations domestically, these organizations can simultaneously gain increased support from migrant communities. This study explores whether autocrats achieve their intended outcomes by legally repressing exile organizations through criminalization. Utilizing a conjoint experiment with 5,996 Russian emigrants residing in 89 countries who left their homeland following the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, we investigate how attributes such as criminalization, anonymity of donations, and transparency influence their cooperation with exile organizations in a geopolitically shaped environment.



Our findings show that criminalization can backfire: Russian exiles perceive it as a marker of political authenticity and effectiveness, providing crucial cues in an environment with limited information and fostering solidarity. Consequently, criminalization can facilitate collective action and the coordination of extraterritorial opposition, signaling which organizations are genuinely committed to opposing the regime. However, geopolitical alliances matter, as cooperation is hindered where perceived risks are high, particularly in host countries allied with the autocrat. Technological solutions, such as anonymous donations, significantly mitigate these risks and boost support, while transparency is key to engaging the most politically active donors. This study contributes to understanding the limits of autocratic transnational control and demonstrates how exile organizations can leverage low-cost measures to foster diaspora’s resilience and address problems of collective action and coordination.",Sociology

Thereby, political actors have a dual role to play: They can provide investment to enhance the efficiency and usage of these systems in different societal areas while also bearing the responsibility of safeguarding citizens from potential harm. Hereby, the degree of politicization of the topic, i.e. if a topic is part of the public and political debate, has an immense influence on the political approach to tackle the issue. The more a topic is politicized, the more urgency political parties experience to develop concrete governance approaches. Yet, existing research has not analysed party programs in terms of both discourse around artificial intelligence and policy recommendations within an election context. This study focuses on the Netherlands and considers and provides an empirical analysis to answer the following question: How do parties discuss AI in their political programs for the 2023 election in the Netherlands? We conducted a manual content analysis of all party manifestos for the 2023 elections in the Netherlands. Our analysis shows that most parties are not laying a big emphasis on AI.

1359,,"The increasing share of women achieving higher education in the second half of the twentieth century in Western countries has led to changes in the educational distribution of couples in the population. The consequences of the educational expansion for health, and especially mortality, have not received enough attention. We use Finnish full population register data and focus on married and cohabiting couples in 1987–2020, born up to 1970, to examine how the partner’s education is associated with individual-level mortality risk. Accelerated failure time models show that the individual and the partner’s educational level significantly relate to individuals' death risk. Overall, the higher the education level of both an individual and their partner, the lower the individual's mortality rate (p&lt;0.05), with men presenting stronger associations than those of women. Additionally, the type of couple to which individuals belong has a distinct association with their mortality. Homogamous highly-educated couples have the highest survival advantage, while low-educated couples have the greatest disadvantage. Heterogamous couples, where one partner is low-educated and another highly educated, are in between. These results are similar for marriage and cohabitation, and across cohorts. The latter finding highlights the importance of both men’s and women’s education for mortality outcomes. While both men and women show these trends, women present much lower differences in mortality than men. These results indicate that there is a clear resource multiplication mechanism influencing the relationship between partners' education and mortality for men, while for women, the mechanisms seem to fall between resource multiplication and substitution. Consequently, low-educated men partnered with low-educated women emerge as the most vulnerable group in terms of mortality risk.",Sociology
1360,,"This systematic literature review addresses the intersection of two rapidly evolving areas of knowledge and practice: Indigenous Knowledge Systems (IKS) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). There is growing scholarly recognition of the rich and diverse nature of IKS, which are unique intergenerational understandings of worldly relations from an Indigenous standpoint. There is now a vast literature on the promise and pitfalls of AI. However, there is a lack of systematic reviews showing how these two dynamic literatures are intersecting, and what the major themes are. AI has the potential to assist the promotion of IKS; however, there are also potential risks arising from AI for Indigenous peoples, such as the erosion of cultural knowledge, and data-grabbing that fails to respect principles of Indigenous Data Sovereignty. These risks can exacerbate existing knowledge hierarchies and socio-economic inequalities. In this paper, we conducted a systematic review of articles published between 2012 and 2023 (January) on Indigenous peoples and AI. We shed light upon four unique overlapping categories into which existing literature can be classified and comprehensively discuss literature under each category. The first two categories discuss AI’s role in assisting the promotion of IKS and the third focuses on the pitfalls of using AI for Indigenous peoples.

Accordingly, this study is guided by the question: How has EC research evolved in engaging with sustainable development, public involvement and critiquing infinite economic growth and technological triumphalism?  Guided by the question of how EC research has developed over time, this analysis particularly focuses on three distinct time periods—1967-2000, 2001-2015, and 2016-2021—to accurately trace the progression and shifts in the field.  A comprehensive bibliometric analysis, utilizing Python scripting for keyword co-occurrence network diagrams was used to ensure a rigorous examination of the literature. The study's findings highlight the crucial roles of sustainable development, public education, and engagement in EC research, emphasizing the need for an interdisciplinary approach that recognizes the intricate interplay between environmental, social, technological, and political factors. This research contributes to advancing EC by advocating for more comprehensive, inclusive, and action-oriented approaches, paving the way for more effective communication strategies and better environmental outcomes.",Sociology

1363,,"An implementation of the journal club model to develop confidence in academic skills across speaking, writing and integrity domains, as well as socialising journal club members to academia, is reported. A journal club was established in a Foundation Year (Pre-undergraduate) context for ten physical scientists. A mixed-methods approach was used to measure self-reported confidence upon entering the university, which was contrasted after attending three, one-hour, journal club meetings, where contemporary literature across diverse subjects was discussed through the lens of ‘academic themes’ to scaffold discussions and support specific skill development. The self-reported confidence was captured through questionnaires and unpacked through semi-structured interviews, the themes of which were generated through qualitative reflexive analysis. Increased confidence in academic speaking was a notable result; journal club members valued the opportunity to present in small, regular, and informal meetings where discussions were appreciated between members. Exposure to subject domains outside of physical sciences where members were confronted with topics for which there is no clear answer, was uncovered as the impetus to disrupt members’ thinking, facilitated by the conversational medium of the journal club. The implementation reported here likely represents the scenario many professionals will find themselves in when considering establishing a journal club.",Sociology

This research examined the evidence for, and experiences of, people with lived experience participating in and influencing housing and homelessness policy, service design and practice.

People with lived experience felt their participation and influence was often far from meaningful. They spoke of being unheard and of their concerns not being taken seriously.

1365,,"There is consensus that algorithmic news recommenders should be explainable to inform news readers of potential risks. However, debates continue over which information users need and which stakeholders should access this information. As the debate continues, researchers also call for more control over algorithmic news recommenders' systems, for example by turning off personalized recommendations. Despite this call, it is unclear the extent to which news readers will use this feature. To add nuance to the discussion, we analyzed 586 responses to two open-ended questions: I) what information needs to contribute to trustworthiness perceptions of new recommendations, and ii) whether people want the ability to turn off personalization. Our results indicate that most participants found knowing the sources of news items important for trusting a recommendation system. Additionally, more than half of the participants were inclined to disable personalization. The most common reasons to turn off personalization included concerns about bias or filter bubbles and a preference to consume generalized news. These findings suggest that news readers have different information needs for explanations when interacting with an algorithmic news recommender and that many news readers prefer to disable the usage of personalized news recommendations.",Sociology
1366,,"Experiments on ethnic or racial discrimination often use names to signal origin
in market situations under the assumption that non-ethnic name signals do not
systematically affect the outcome. Using survey data, we demonstrate significant
variation in perceived trustworthiness and professionalism of names within origins.
Linking this to a large-scale name-matched field experiment, we show that
the variation in name perception predicts discriminatory behavior: Prospective
tenants in Switzerland with names exogenously rated as less trustworthy or less
professional receive fewer invitations to an apartment viewing. These marketrelevant
characteristics explain, to a large extent, group differences in measured
discrimination. Ethnic minority names that score high on either trustworthiness
or professionalism are not discriminated against, while names scoring low on these
are discriminated against (relative to the majority name). In line with intergroup
contact theory, we also show that, regardless of their origin, more common names
face less discrimination. Our results reveal that discriminatory behavior is much
more nuanced than a simple in-group/out-group dichotomy would suggest.",Sociology

This study estimates and decomposes this elasticity using data from Japan’s largest private job-matching intermediary. On average, our findings reveal that recruitment elasticity is not significantly different from zero. However, this average masks important heterogeneity: workers earning above the median wage exhibit positive elasticity, while those earning below the median show an insignificant but negative elasticity. Further analysis suggests that the negative elasticity among lower-wage workers stems from their reluctance to inquire about higher-wage vacancies. Additionally, we uncover several notable patterns: there are minimal systematic differences in elasticity between on-the-job and off-the-job searches; workers tend to choose similar job types and locations during the inquiry and application stages; and the matched wage is largely determined by the lower bound of the posted wage range.",Sociology

This comparative research enables us to consider key questions: How might online GBV-P be conceptualized and studied across diverse contexts, and what are the challenges in doing so? Are some global patterns more or less prevalent in Canada?

We found a direct association between supervisory procedural justice and organizational citizenship behavior, and an indirect association between organizational justice and organizational citizenship behavior, through mental wellbeing. These findings suggest that while prison officers directly reciprocate the fair treatment received by supervisors by engaging in discretionary actions benefiting the organization, fair treatment by the organization has more of an indirect effect via influencing officer wellbeing. Our results highlight the importance of both supervisors and organizations treating their staff with procedural justice; not only does fair treatment increase mental wellbeing, but it encourages behaviors that extend beyond formal job requirements. Cultivating such behaviors among new prison officers may ultimately improve practices, cultures, and outcomes for people in custody within prisons.",Sociology

Despite its shared understanding as beneficial resources available from the connections between people, authors vary widely in their conceptualizations of social capital. To extract clarity from these disparate perspectives, we offer a systematic framework for conceptualizing social capital, which identifies three primary theoretical dimensions of scholars’ conceptualizations of social capital: (1) where beneficial resources reside, ranging from within individuals to the relationships between individuals, (2) beneficial network structure, differentiating closure from brokerage arrangements, and (3) the level to which rewards accrue, distinguishing individual from collective benefits. We illustrate how combining these dimensions produces a unifying perspective that fosters reintegrating social capital’s disconnected conceptualizations. Finally, we draw on this framework to both reconcile seeming contradictions and gaps in social capital scholarship and provide a principled means for prioritizing questions for future developments of social capital.",Sociology

The paper reconstructs long-term trends in wealth inequality for the period 1550-1800 for a sample of communities in the region Apulia and produces estimates of overall inequality levels across the region. These estimates are compared with those which have recently been published for other Italian and European regions or states. The article also reconstructs the total income distribution for the mid-eighteenth century, then comparing wealth and income inequality. Overall, the evidence for the Kingdom of Naples suggests a tendency for economic inequality to grow continuously over the early modern period. As this was mostly a period of economic stagnation or decline for the Kingdom, the article provides further insights to the debate on the long-run relationship between economic growth and inequality change.

In this era of renewed and more vigorous efforts to clear people experiencing unsheltered homelessness (unsheltered PEH) from city sidewalks, parks, and elsewhere, elected officials and other stakeholders need to clearly understand the dynamics of their unsheltered PEH populations. To advance understanding, this study investigated in-migration of unsheltered PEH in conjunction with the Los Angeles Continuum of Care’s 2024 HUD-mandated Point-in-Time count. In response to the measurement work of Mitchell (2024), the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority’s 2024 Demographic Survey of unsheltered PEH instrument included a new item distinguishing between perceptions of a place where one has lived versus stayed, which revealed whether in-migration of individuals and families coming to the area immediately experienced homelessness or became unhoused after relocation. This analysis of over one-thousand survey participants self-identified as having migrated into Los Angeles County (a quarter of the total sample of unsheltered PEH) also explored whether there were associations with first-time homelessness or with being accompanied by household members. Responses to this complex survey were analyzed using Stata 17 MP. Key findings include that most survey participants reported either arriving homeless and unsheltered or first staying in either their own or a friend’s or family member’s home. More than half of all in-migration was initially to housed situations (more so for first-time homelessness), not into homelessness. Lone adults were more likely to experience homelessness immediately while accompanied adults were most likely to first stay in someone else’s home.",Sociology

Using a conjoint survey experiment conducted in May 2024 among Swedish-speaking Finnish citizens, we assessed the importance of various ethnic attributes on candidate choice. The findings reveal that while multiple ethnic markers affect candidate choice, the most significant factor is whether a candidate is nominated by an ethnic party.

This study explores local perceptions of common pool resource management in the Tana River using vignettes characterising hypothetical rivers with declining or sustainable fish stock levels. Participants were asked about ideal catch redistribution levels, beliefs about actual contributions, and factors necessary for successful common pool resource management. An allocation game was also played to measure actual cooperation. The results show that while participants believe around 35-50% of the catch should be redistributed, they expect actual contributions to be lower at 15-30%. In the allocation game, the modal proportion that participants gave away was 0% of the stake. Participants also rated the likelihood of various outcomes if a common storage facility was introduced, with those from Karasjok having a more pessimistic outlook than those from Tana. Substantial agreement was found for monitoring, shared traditions, and co-management in both municipalities. Almost all participants indicated disagreements over river use, with tourism and specific fishing gear being the main points of contention. The study discusses the role of traditional ecological knowledge in management, highlighting the limitations of traditional ecological knowledge when designing effective conservation schemes.",Sociology
1377,,"This paper uses survey data from Germany, Spain, France, Italy, Great Britain and the United States to analyze how inheritances impact wealth inequality in a range of rich countries. Adopting an influence function regression approach, the paper calculates the counterfactual effects of small increases in the share of recipients of different-sized wealth transfers in each country. Results suggest that while a marginal increase in inheritance recipients generally contracts wealth inequality measures – confirming a common finding in the literature that inter-generational transfers tend to reduce relative wealth inequality – an increase in recipients of ‘large’ inheritances has the opposite effect. We determine what ‘large’ means in this context by point-estimating the thresholds above which transfers become disequalising. Such thresholds are then put in perspective against the inheritance tax schedules in place in the six countries analyzed. No unique pattern emerges. While the thresholds are very close to tax exemption thresholds in Britain and Germany, they are somewhat higher in France and Spain and they are much lower in Italy and the United States.

Behind this digital platform are AI experts and musicians based in Cambridge, MA. Suno does not participate in conventional composing, songwriting, performing, or recording practices. Instead, it generates music based on user prompts in a text/audio/image/video-to-music interface. Suno aims to democratize music production by enabling anyone to become a “musician.” However, the absence of a conventional “real” artist or author (auteur) responsible for these music productions raises questions about how various agents will perceive the music’s authenticity. Through observations and conceptual reflections, this paper explores the possibilities of authenticating Suno’s productions, their implications for music scenes, and the potentially changing nature of musicianship.

1379,,"This study explores the effectiveness of Germany’s rent control regulation in the context of Munich's housing crisis. The rent brake, aimed at preventing excessive rents in tense housing markets, was implemented in 2015 in Germany but has faced challenges in practical application. This research evaluates the number of tenants eligible to use the rent brake, investigates how eligibility of the rent break varies depending on housing conditions and landlord types and identifies factors hindering its application.
A sample of 10,000 individuals from Munich's registration database, covering residents who moved after 2019, was drawn, resulting in 356 complete responses for analysis. The survey assessed demographics, rental conditions, and knowledge of the rent brake, with findings weighted by city district and household size.
The study reveals that while 13% minimum and up to 38% of tenants could potentially apply the rent brake, only 2% of respondents had successfully secured a rent reduction. This low uptake is attributed to limited awareness—only 38% of participants knew about the rent brake—and fears of landlord retaliation, such as potential termination or strained relationships. The study concludes that the tenant-dependent enforcement undermines the effectiveness of the rent breake. Enhanced information access, tenant support systems, and institutional measures are needed to strengthen the regulation's impact and promote fair housing practices.",Sociology

This study examines the impact that a strengths-based care programme – Community Led Support (CLS) – has had on new and existing clients in England. Specifically, we used a difference-in-difference approach to estimate the treatment effect of CLS on care provision, reviews, and expenditure, using the Short and Long Term (SALT) dataset published by NHS Digital (2016 to 2021). Within local authorities that implemented CLS, we found evidence of changing care pathways for new clients, including a ten percentage-point reduction in funded care provision – though evidence for increased signposting to alternative services in this dataset was mixed. For existing clients, we found evidence of general improvements in the quality of practice, as indicated by higher ratios of planned to unplanned care reviews. These improvements were also realised without concomitant increases in expenditure rates. We believe these results can contribute toward an evidence base for CLS, and for strengths-based practice more generally.",Sociology

1384,,"Theory and empirical evidence suggest that parents often allocate their investments unevenly among their children, resulting in disparities within families. This study explores two key questions: (1) Do parents reinforce or compensate for differences in their children’s grit, a critical indicator of socioemotional development? and (2) Do these parental responses vary according to family socioeconomic status (SES)? Drawing on data from the Korean Children and Youth Panel Survey, this study examines cohorts of elementary (4th grade) and middle (7th grade) school students to shed light on the mechanisms that perpetuate inequalities in socioemotional skills within a society characterized by intense educational competition.
The sibling fixed-effects models reveal three key findings. First, parental investment in children’s socioemotional development predominantly takes the form of reinforcement rather than compensation. Second, reinforcing parenting behaviors are more pronounced among middle-school children than elementary-school children, reflecting shifts in parental strategies during adolescence. Third, these reinforcement patterns are more prevalent in high-SES families, particularly those with highly educated parents. These findings highlight the role of family background in shaping access to socioemotional resources and have significant implications for understanding the reproduction of inequality through educational and developmental pathways.",Sociology

This study presents visioning-based exploration of ecologically diverse and peaceful futures of the Korean peninsula with its DMZ as a potential global commons. Through a visioning workshop, stakeholders used the Nature Futures Framework and Seeds of Good Anthropocene to develop four visions that reflect diverse value and meanings of nature for sustainable and wellbeing-oriented futures. The co-developed visions emphasize the importance of harmonizing human activities with nature, envisioning the DMZ as a space for peaceful coexistence and ecological restoration. They offer citizens’ perspectives on sustainable and inclusive futures with existing initiatives as levers and inter-sectoral and inter-disciplinary collaboration as mediums.

Many scholars view the mobilization of remittances as a more resilient channel for development financing compared to other traditional sources.  The study explores the role of remittances in economic growth and the financial development pathway empirically. We used autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) and Granger causality techniques and time series data covering the period from 1996 to 2020. From the table, we found a statistically significant negative long-run relationship between remittances and economic growth.  However, in the short run, a significant positive relationship was found to exist between remittances and financial development reflecting a complementary relationship. Our findings also showed that foreign direct investment (FDI) and gross domestic formation(GCF) were statistically significant in their relationship with financial development in the long run. From the  pairwise Granger test, a unidirectional causality from remittance inflows (Rem) to financial development was established while bidirectional causality between foreign direct investment (FDI) and gross capital formation (GCF). The study concludes that a certain degree of financial development might stifle long-term economic progress, and the combined effect of financial development and remittances should be of concern to policymakers. Given the study's finding of a negative contribution of remittances to economic growth in the long run, a significant policy consequence is that efforts to encourage remittances and those to improve the financial system should be undertaken concurrently.",Sociology

Despite the narrowing of gender disparities in access to higher education in Korea, this study examines whether obtaining a university degree reduces gender wage inequality. It focuses on the effects of college selectivity and field of study, analyzing how horizontal stratification in higher education influences the gender wage gap in the early labor market. Furthermore, it compares results from traditional linear regression with debiased machine learning, which accounts for selection bias and high-dimensional data.
Using data from the Graduate Occupational Mobility Survey (GOMS), the analysis reveals that linear regression estimates a consistent gender wage gap of roughly 10% across all levels of higher education. In contrast, double machine learning identifies a 15% wage gap for graduates of two-year colleges and around 10% for those with four-year degrees. By field of study, linear regression reports consistent gaps, while double machine learning identifies a 6% gap in the humanities, 10-12% in education, natural sciences, and social sciences, and 14% in engineering. This study underscores that accounting for selection bias and high-dimensional data reveals nuanced insights, uncovering significant gender wage gaps among two-year college graduates and notably larger gaps in engineering compared to other fields.",Sociology

The time that children spend gaming has very modest association with skill and efficacy. Accounting for the frequency with which children modify games, engage in social gaming activities, and the salience of gamer identity explains the gender gap in computer skill and significantly narrows the gender gap in computer efficacy.

At its limits the imitative paradigm appears destined to produce theoretical as much as practical contradictions. For example, the very desire to build an AI appears connected to human traits that seem difficult to replicate, as it stems from an organisation of subjectivity that includes a sense of lack or deficiency which, in its reproduction, would defeat certain stated purposes of AI such as the realisation of general or super intelligence. To explore such dilemmas, this article begins by exploring Girard’s idea of mimetic desire, itself philosophically influential within parts of the AI community, and how this relates to the production of an artificial subjectivity. It then switches to examine how AI is framed fetishistically – as an object upon which human desire is projected and invested. Finally, it works through theorisations of alienation, and posits an interpretation of AI as both alien and alienated as a useful conceptual alternative to the pure pursuit of human-like computational agents. The article concludes with speculation about the possibility of symbiotic pedagogy: the side-by-side juxtaposition of human and machine learning, without expectation of mimetic convergence between the two.",Sociology

In this paper, we investigate to what extent sexual orientation moderates the relationship between social origin and educational attainment and whether the educational premium among LGB people might be concentrated among individuals from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. We propose, elaborate, and provide a theoretical underpinning for the ‘Queer Habitus’ hypothesis which states that having an LGB identity can lead to weaker family-of-origin ties and disrupt people’s class habitus. These factors can lead LGB people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds to pursue higher levels of education as compared to their heterosexual counterparts. Empirically, the paper takes advantage of the oversampling of LGB individuals in the 2019 wave of the nationally representative probability-based German Socio-Economic Panel study (SOEP; N = 15,746; LGB = 589). The findings challenge the idea that educational premiums are limited to gay men by showing that both LGB men and LGB women have higher educational attainment than their straight counterparts in Germany. Further, this educational ‘advantage’ is moderated by social origin. The higher education of LGB people is concentrated among those with disadvantaged social origin compared to straight individuals from similar social backgrounds. Overall, this lends support to the ‘Queer Habitus’ hypothesis which argues that the disruption of the heterosexual habitus by an LGB identity causes a weaker association of the social origin on educational attainment.",Sociology

This study compared Singapore residents' perceptions and awareness of scenario-based etiquette towards four prominent urban wildlife species: smooth‐coated otters (Lutrogale perspicillata), long-tailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis), Malayan water monitor lizards (Varanus salvator) and reticulated pythons (Malayopython reticulatus). Using online surveys (n=399), we investigated how demographic factors and exposure to each species influence perceptions. Our results show significant differences in perceptions and etiquette responses towards each species. Respondents had the highest affinity towards otters, perceived greater property damage from mammals than reptiles, and feared terrestrial more than semi-aquatic species. Respondents’ age, parental status, frequency of park visits, involvement in wildlife programs and frequency of seeing each species significantly influenced perceptions, suggesting a need to engage older people and parents more to improve wildlife perceptions. Notably, the frequency of direct encounters with wildlife only explained 1% of variation in perceptions, suggesting that exposure or familiarity alone do not ensure coexistence with wildlife. Our findings emphasise the need for more public education on wildlife etiquette, especially regarding macaques. We found that wildlife education lowered perceptions of property damage but not fear, suggesting that addressing misconceptions and negative perceptions requires fostering positive emotional connections with wildlife. Our analysis highlights the interplay between urban aesthetics, cultural perceptions, wildlife education, and human and animal behaviour in shaping human-wildlife interactions. Most saliently, our study demonstrates the importance of species-specific approaches to improve relationships between humans and wildlife.",Sociology
1394,,"Objective
To characterize and describe the healthcare costs for occupational accidents involving biological risk in a High-Level Hospital in Bogotá, Colombia, in the period of January-August of 2024. 
Methodology
A database containing information on all reported occupational accidents at a High-Level Hospital from January to August 2024 was used. The data was filtered based on the ""nature of the injury"", including only occupational accidents involving biological risk. Subsequently, billing records for the healthcare costs of each identified case were requested, allowing for an analysis and characterization of the expenses.
Results
It was found that most of these types of occupational accidents occurred in female workers, among nursing assistants. Older age was associated with a higher average healthcare cost, and it was also observed that men had healthcare costs 1.5 times higher than those of women. This latter finding is not considered representative due to selection bias.
Conclusion
It was observed that there was a greater report of OA in the female population than in the male population, associated with a greater number of female workers in the Hospital. The positions with more OA reported are those of nursing assistants and nurses, with a higher risk of presenting biological accidents due to greater exposure.  
There is a wide heterogeneity of care costs due to various interventions performed in hospital care. There is a directly proportional relationship between the cost of care and the age range of the worker. On average men have a higher cost of care than women, however this is not representative due to sample selection bias.",Sociology

It offers a range of functions to download microdata and aggregated data for all of the Brazilian census editions since 1960 and provides access to essential documentation such as variable dictionaries and interview manuals. Through this approach, {censobr} enhances accessibility to detailed demographic and socioeconomic information, including both individual-level microdata and census tract-level aggregates. Additionally, the package's handling of complex survey designs and support for spatial data visualization facilitates in-depth analysis of the sociodemographic characteristics and living conditions of the Brazilian population over several decades. Practical examples included in the paper demonstrate its applications in areas such as demographic analysis and household-level research. {censobr} represents a significant advancement in making Brazilian census data accessible and efficient for academic and policy-related research. Future updates will expand its functionality and data coverage, contributing further to the ease of use and analytical capabilities of the package.",Sociology
1396,,"When the effect of a treatment variable on an outcome variable differs between two groups, an interaction effect is present. Since this is one of the most common statistical analyses, Stata offers a wide variety of methods to investigate such effects. The present study outlines how these different analyses can be performed in Stata and provides a comprehensive simulation study to determine which method has the best statistical properties. To this end, both the nominal alpha error rate and statistical power are assessed for continuous and binary dependent variables. For a deeper analysis, not only are the sample sizes varied, but other potential challenges are also considered, such as heteroscedasticity for the continuous outcome and imbalanced binary outcome variables. The results indicate that some methods deviate significantly from the nominal alpha limit, leading to incorrect conclusions on average. For the continuous outcome variable, the OLS regression approach with robust (HC3) standard errors and an interaction term yields the best results. For the binary outcome, we recommend the logit model with robust standard errors or the linear probability model with robust (HC3) standard errors.",Sociology
1397,,"The political stability of Argentina is a striking phenomenon in the scientific realm. This work factually demonstrates that one of the origins of instability is the contempt of the Spanish in America for the authority of the Spanish Crown, a behavior born during the stage of conquest and colonization of America. The validation process consists of a historical analysis that is summarized in propositionally logical statements, which allow the deduction and confirmation of the initial hypothesis. For the demonstration, violations of Royal edicts are analyzed, including the prohibition of slave labor and the obligations to only buy products from Spain, to treat the indigenous people well, and to consider them free men with rights to their territories. In all cases, the violations did not have significant punishments, probably due to the practical impossibility of controlling offenders from a distance, in a historical context where efficient means of communication did not exist. This lack of punishment gave rise to a contempt for authority, a custom that was passed down from generation to generation and is currently manifested as the contempt of all citizens for laws and regulations issued by any authority. This behavior partially explains the current political instability in Argentina.",Sociology
1398,,"The rise of psychological and technological tools to influence public behaviour has reshaped societal dynamics, often amplifying division and mistrust. While these tools are frequently weaponised to exploit cognitive biases and deepen polarisation, this paper argues that their potential for ethical application can foster unity, empathy and collective progress. Drawing on principles from social psychology and real-world case studies, it explores how cognitive biases like social proof and the availability heuristic, when ethically applied, can inspire cooperation and shared goals. The dual-use nature of technology - highlighted through algorithms, artificial intelligence and bots - is critically analysed, revealing both risks and opportunities. Practical frameworks for designing influence campaigns rooted in transparency, inclusivity and empathy are proposed, alongside safeguards to prevent manipulation. By reclaiming these tools for ethical purposes, this paper calls on leaders, technologists and citizens to actively shape a more empathetic and connected society, harnessing the power of influence to unite rather than divide.",Sociology
1399,,"An increasing number of studies have examined fertility variation at the regional level within countries, but this research has largely focused on women. As a result, our knowledge of regional variation in male fertility remains limited. The current study addresses this research gap by examining how the timing and chances of parenthood vary regionally for women and men in four countries in Northern and Western Europe. We hypothesise that men may be subject to less regional variation in their first births than women, and that gender differences in first births may be less pronounced in urban centres, such as the capital regions, and especially among groups with higher levels of education. The study is based on data collected from female and male cohorts born between 1963 and 1970 in Finland, France, the Netherlands, and Sweden. The results broadly support our hypotheses: men show modestly smaller differences in the timing and chances of first parenthood between capital and other regions than women, and consequently smaller gender differences in first parenthood exist in capital regions in all countries except the Netherlands. Moreover, highly educated women and men living in the capital regions have the most similar timing and chances of entering parenthood.",Sociology

1401,,"Criminologists maintain a vested interest in hard-to-reach populations, such as active offenders, former prisoners, and affiliates of criminal enterprises. For five decades, policymakers and researchers have sought national estimates of gang activity. Traditional methods, such as surveys sampling law enforcement agencies or youth populations, have provided valuable insights into gang activity in the United States. However, these approaches face limitations, including bias, obsolescence, high costs, outdated data, and restricted scope. This study examines the potential of online opt-in panels to studying gang populations. Contracting with YouGov, we administered four surveys to 13,148 respondents between January 2023 and January 2024, measuring lifetime gang membership and its correlates. Lifetime gang membership estimates ranged from 2.0% to 2.4% in custom surveys and 5.3% to 6.2% in omnibus surveys. While demographic and socioeconomic correlates showed mixed results, ecological and legal correlates consistently aligned with expectations based on prior research. Our findings suggest cautious optimism about the utility of online opt-in panels for studying hard-to-reach populations like gang members and advancing cross-national, comparative research in line with the Eurogang Program of Research. These panels offer advantages such as cost-efficiency, accessibility, and timeliness, but further validation is necessary to establish their reliability and validity for population-level estimates.",Sociology

This paper outlines the objectives and outcomes of allyship three workshops a) Faculty Allies, b) STEM Allies: Ambassadors for Change for students, and c) Allyship Think Tank for stakeholders of partnering non-profit organization for women. It was hypothesized that participating stakeholders recognize their own privileges and biases and evaluate their role-based power to effect organizational change.  The paper provides details of implementation of each workshop including specific goals and learning outcomes, recruitment strategies, demographics of participants, and their feedback on workshop environment, aspects, and implementation strategy. The objectives of the workshops were designed to a) apply outcome-based principles of diversity, equity, and inclusion, b) reflect on one’s identities and power to change, c) characterize cognitive biases, d) articulate various roles of allies, and e) practice intervention skills and strategies. The active learning based pedagogical approach of the workshops involved group discussion, role plays, self-reflection, and dialogue in a safe environment allowing participants to share and learn from each other’s lived experiences and perspectives. Quantitative and qualitative assessment suggested that the participants found the workshop, its facilitation and environment, and overall content to be remarkably effective. The paper also discusses strategies to use the research and advocacy conducted by Think Tanks to inform the content and structure of workshops, thereby, creating a feedback loop to ensure the workshop curriculum represent the most current and comprehensive understanding of allyship.",Sociology
1403,,"Citizenship has become a key concept for studying the relationship between individuals and the state. The notion of lived citizenship, in particular, highlights how the rights and obligations of citizenship are lived differently based on race, gender, class and other markers of social difference. However, much of the existing scholarship remains rooted in global North contexts, with limited attention to the realities of living under weak institutions. This research note builds on critical citizenship studies and foundational works on citizenship in the global South to offer an original conceptual framework for studying lived citizenship. It starts with a rethinking of the classical division of civil, social and political rights of citizenship into four fields of relating to the state: protection, provision, participation and belonging. It then illustrates how our experiences of these four fields are structured by four interconnected elements: social locations, relations, practices, and emotions. It conceptualizes these four fields and elements in ways that address dynamics of informality, clientelism, extralegal violence and authoritarianism that often mediate the relationship with the state in the global South. By bridging key theoretical and empirical gaps, this conceptualization offers new insights for organizing our inquiry into citizenship as lived and contested across the globe.",Sociology

The analysis will discuss the impact of China's 2017 ban on importing plastic waste for the EU, particularly looking at its implications for the EU waste management sector. The paper will suggest that China's ban ultimately dismantled the EU waste management framework, forcing it to begin treating low-quality plastics domestically. 
Through highlighting inconsistencies in the EU's environmental regulations, the study will suggest that the current domestic treatment of low-quality plastics in the EU has triggered instances of environmental and health damage to vulnerable local communities. 
The case study of Phaten Plastic recycling will underscore a critical instance of non-compliance to EU Environmental standards, yet this will serve to outline regulatory issues with ensuring that waste management companies comply with the EU’s environmental regulations. The paper will ultimately advocate for the need of a more robust EU accountability framework, in order to deter waste management companies from causing environmental damage to local environments and communities and adhere to Eu environmental standards.",Sociology

This study documents the labor market deficits of mental disorders in both the short and the very long term using Finnish administrative data on hospitalizations, outpatient visits, and labor market outcomes. A history of psychiatric hospitalization is associated with approximately 50 % deficit in lifetime income relative to non-diagnosed control group, and this deficit is larger, the earlier that hospitalization occurs. Event study estimates suggest that labor market performance tends to deteriorate before the first psychiatric treatment, which undermines causal interpretations in the differencein-differences framework. Disorders related to acute stress are an exception, and do not exhibit pretrends; however, these disorders often originate from traumatic life-events that may also have direct impact on individuals’ work capacity, leaving the interpretation of the point estimates ambiguous.",Sociology
1406,,"Single-use disposable cups are a significant contributor to plastic waste due to their widespread use and limited recyclability. Policymakers worldwide are implementing measures to reduce their consumption and encourage reusable alternatives. This study evaluates the impact of regulatory measures (charges and discounts), persuasion (environmental information prompts), and consumer motivations (using Protection Motivation Theory) on preferences for single-use, refillable, and returnable cups. Using discrete choice experiments with a nationally representative sample, we find that a charge of 25–30 pence is required to reduce single-use cup selection by 50%, whereas a discount of at least 70 pence achieves a similar effect. Information prompts have minimal influence on choices, while environmentally motivated consumer segments demonstrate greater responsiveness to discounts. These findings provide actionable, evidence-based insights for policymakers and industry stakeholders, supporting the design of effective interventions to accelerate the transition from single-use to reusable systems.",Sociology
1407,,"This paper provides an analytical exploration of how network characteristics influence residential segregation. Building upon the foundational Schelling model, I develop an Agent-based simulation wherein agents are embedded within a social network structure. This approach allows for the experimental manipulation of network features such as homophily, clustering, and degree, enabling the assessment of their individual and combined impacts on segregation levels, patterns, and the stability of the socio-spatial system. I find that certain configurations of these network features can exacerbate residential sorting to levels exceeding those predicted by the original Schelling model. These outcomes underscore the critical role of social network dynamics, particularly the significance of weak ties, in driving a system toward a segregated state. The results contribute to the broader sociological discourse on social networks, highlighting the complex interplay between network structure and social phenomena, and offering new insights into the mechanisms underlying residential segregation.",Sociology
1408,,"This paper explores social norms on social media, emphasizing the need for inductive research to capture the nuanced processes of norm adoption and adherence. Adopting a qualitative mixed-method approach, the study combines screen recordings, eye-tracking, think-aloud protocols, and semi-structured interviews to analyze how users perceive and adapt to social norms. Findings from 21 participants reveal distinct patterns of norm adoption with participants actively inferring platform-specific norms through visual cues (e.g., type of photos) and contextual signals (e.g., comments). Conversely, norm adherence on familiar platforms appears to involve more unconscious, habitual inferences shaped by both close peer influence and platform-specific expectations. The study highlights variations in norm processes across platforms, where Instagram promotes curated, idealized self-presentation, while TikTok encourages authenticity. Moreover, individual characteristics, platform affordances, and peer influence were found to shape self-presentation and self-disclosure and social norm adherence in diverse ways, underscoring the complexity and at times the striking uniqueness of digital self-expression of individual people. In sum, this research contributes to social norm theory by differentiating between norm adoption and adherence and by underscoring the impact of both interpersonal connections and platform culture on online behaviors.",Sociology

Building on research on political trust as related to democratic legitimacy and on trust’s attitudinal and behavioral consequences, we formulate expectations about longitudinal effects of political trust on democracy. Our primary hypothesis is that political trust has a positive effect on subsequent changes in democratic quality, but only in countries that have already achieved some level of democracy. To test this hypothesis, we employ Bayesian latent trend analysis to estimate a time series of political trust for 62 countries over 30 years. We fit lagged variable models to the trust time series combined with democracy measures from the Varieties of Democracy project and economic indicators. We find little evidence of an overall effect of trust on democracy, and stronger evidence for a positive effect among already democratic countries.",Sociology

We fine-tune and validate a Large Language Model (Google's Gemini) to develop novel textual indices of policy pressures regarding monetary policy communication of central banks in speeches of 100 central banks from 1997 to 2023. Employing a staggered difference-in-differences and an instrumental variable approach, we find robust evidence that an increase in independence decreases monetary pressures and increases financial pressures discussed in monetary policy communication.

1415,,"Purpose
Customer value co-creation (CVCC) intention has been shown to foster favorable consumer attitudes towards businesses, thereby promoting positive consumer behavior. However, research on the application of this phenomenon in the e-commerce domain remains limited. Grounded in social exchange and social identity theories, this study investigates the mediating role of satisfaction in the relationship between perceived corporate social responsibility (CSR) and CVCC intention, as well as the moderating effect of gender on this mediation within the e-commerce context.

Design/methodology/approach
A cross-sectional survey was conducted using non-probability convenience sampling, involving 309 students from Keimyung University in Korea. Confirmatory factor analysis was performed using SPSS-AMOS, and the proposed hypotheses were tested through SPSS PROCESS Model 7.

Findings
The findings of this study indicate that satisfaction partially mediates the relationship between perceived CSR and CVCC intention. Additionally, this mediation is moderated by gender, with the effect of perceived CSR on CVCC intention through satisfaction being stronger for female participants than for male participants.

Originality/value
This study extends social exchange and social identity theories to the e-commerce domain by elucidating the mechanisms through which CSR influences CVCC intention. It highlights the pivotal role of satisfaction in linking CSR with CVCC intention and emphasizes the moderating influence of gender. Practical recommendations are provided for e-commerce businesses to enhance the effectiveness of their CSR initiatives in fostering consumer engagement.",Sociology

We observe that existing algorithmic approaches, either based on citation or semantic approaches, have problems of logic consistency of the categories obtained, which belong to methods, materials, empirical objects or theories.

We then observed whether other wineries participated in webinars on carbon footprint measurement to collect information. We find that this message about climate leadership did not encourage the wineries to participate in the webinar, and it even had a negative effect on nearby wineries.

1421,,"To address social concerns that online personalisation algorithms increase polarisation, scholars have studied two distinct classes of agent based models of opinion dynamics constructed to explain polarisation: contagion/reinforcement class and repulsion class. It has been rigorously demonstrated that these classes make contrasting predictions on the relationship between polarisation and homophily (thought to be a consequence of online personalisation algorithms). However, consequences of a model that combines contagion and repulsion on the relationship between homophily and polarisation has not been rigorously studied. Thus, this paper proposes a theoretical foundation for such a model and extends an existing contagion class attitude dynamics model into a  contagion-repulsion combination model. This results in a novel equation of attitude change which positions the combination model as a generalisation of several other opinion dynamics models. Subsequently, simulation experiments test implications of this model on the relationship between homophily and polarisation. Results show different parameter combinations produce several qualitatively different forms of the relationship, ranging from increasing, decreasing, U-shaped or even flat. This suggests the relationship between polarisation and homophily is sensitive to context and may be issue dependent.",Sociology

1426,,"This AHURI research examines how governments can encourage small-scale private investors to provide affordable rental housing. It finds that landlords who follow the positively geared, long-term hold investment (LTHI) model are most likely to be part of affordable housing schemes.

The LTHI landlords invest on the basis of positive cashflow earning reliable rental income. In general, they purchase cheaper housing in lower value locations and seek to own their investment property outright by retirement. LTHIs landlords can provide a source of affordable rental housing, but do not tend to lead the creation of new stock.

The landlords will participate in affordable housing schemes that maximise the potential for a positive cashflow, and not those based on financial schemes such as negative gearing and capital gains tax concessions. It is important to index rental increases to market rates so that investors who lock-in to long-term schemes are not disincentivised.

Focus groups with small-scale landlords who lease their properties to social housing providers (SHPs) found the landlords were unanimous in their support for headlease programs. The advantages for landlords included:
- guaranteed rental payments provided cashflow security—such rental guarantees made investors 12 per cent more likely to participate in a scheme
- no loss of rent due to vacancy and no need to advertise for new tenants
- guaranteed make-good provisions gave confidence that the property would be returned in original condition
- reduced administration demands provided peace of mind and a ‘hands free’ approach.",Sociology

Intriguingly, the Chinese public does not appear to differentiate between merit- and luck-based inequalities, despite China’s historical emphasis on meritocratic institutions. We propose that this phenomenon could be due to the Chinese public’s greater reluctance to make an active choice in real-stake redistribution decisions. We run an incentivized redistribution experiment with elite university students in China and France, by varying the initial split of payoffs between two real-life workers to redistribute from. We show that, compared to French respondents, Chinese respondents consistently and significantly choose more non-redistribution across both highly unequal and relatively equal status quo scenarios. Additionally, we also find that Chinese respondents do differentiate between merit- and luck-based inequalities, and do not redistribute less than the French, excluding the individuals who engage in non-redistribution choices. Chinese respondents are also as reactive as the French towards scenarios with noisy signals of merit, such as inequalities of opportunities. Ultimately, we contend that the reluctance to make an active choice is indicative of diminished political agency to act upon redistribution decisions with real-life stakes, rather than apathy, inattention, having benefited from the status quo in Chinese society or libertarian preferences among the Chinese. Notably, our findings show that Chinese individuals’ reluctance to make a choice is particularly pronounced among those from families of working-class and farming backgrounds, while it is absent among individuals whose families have closer ties to the private sector.

1429,,"This study investigates the relationship between temperature variations, crime and policing in the UK. Using geocoded administrative data on reported crime, stops and searches and police use of force incidents, combined with daily temperature data at 1km grid-level, results show the same temperature-crime link found in other countries. Against this background, I find evidence for changes in police priorities and search outcomes. While there is no decrease in police effectiveness in searches, there is evidence for ethnic differences, especially affecting Black subjects. Additionally, police use-of-force incidents increase in intensity during hotter periods, leading to higher civilian resistance and injuries.",Sociology
1430,,"The political stability of a modern democracy, excluding environmental or external causes, is determined by multiple factors, all influenced by human behaviour. One indicator of political stability that takes the human factor into account is the time in office of a ruler. The stability of a ruler can be directly affected, for example, if they are killed, or indirectly, if the laws issued by the ruler are not followed. Non-compliance is dependent on the level of contempt for authority among citizens. A post-hoc hypothesis from a previous publication suggests that indigenous contempt for the authority of the white conqueror and coloniser is seen as a primary causal factor of political instability in Argentina. In this work, indigenous contempt has been shown to have originated from the mistreatment of indigenous peoples by the conqueror and coloniser, and it is expressed in practice by laws and norms being violated as a covert form of resistance. This behaviour has been spread throughout Argentine society due to extensive genetic mixing between Amerindian and Eurasian peoples, initially encouraged by the Spanish Crown. It is observed that these behaviours persist in the 21st century, partly because mistreatment and discrimination against indigenous peoples continue, and partly because pigmentocracy exists, a social system where wealth and status depend on skin colour. It is therefore crucial to understand that a large part of the causes of Argentina's political instability can be traced to the non-compliance with laws and regulations, which originated as forms of indigenous resistance to the Spanish conqueror and coloniser. Public policies aimed at improving compliance should be designed to integrate indigenous cultures into Argentine identity, ensuring that all citizens wish to comply with the laws because they now see them as their own.",Sociology
1431,,"Background: The concept of resilience in familial and social contexts has gained prominence in academic and policy discussions. However, the interplay between family life and social inequalities, and how these relate to each other in the resilience literature, has yet to be documented.

Objective: This scoping review addresses this gap by analysing 250 articles published between 1998 and 2023. We compare the concept of resilience as applied in family and social resilience studies through four constitutive elements: (I) unit of analysis, (II) definitions, (III) types, and the (IV) topics of risks, outcomes, and explanatory factors empirically examined.

Results: While both perspectives study individuals’ resilience, the emphasis in family resilience is on families, whereas social resilience studies focus more on communities and societies. Both perspectives emphasize the centrality of risks in defining resilience, yet family resilience scholarship seeks solutions within the family, while social resilience highlights community dynamics. Additionally, family resilience studies explore topics related to family-specific risks and resources, while social resilience studies examine external risks and resources.

Conclusions: The family resilience scholarship follows the clinical tradition of resilience literature, viewing families as a separate entity that is resourceful and agentic. Socioeconomic risks are recurrent themes in social resilience, but not in the family resilience literature.

Contribution: Understanding resilience through the lens of family inequalities in socioeconomic contexts can bridge these two perspectives. Incorporating factors such as labour market dynamics, family transitions, and educational attainment into definitions of risks, outcomes, and explanatory factors of resilience can enhance this integration.",Sociology
1432,,"Open citations play a vital role in enhancing the transparency, reproducibility, and accessibility of scholarly research. This systematic review examines the evolution, impact, and future prospects of open citations through a detailed analysis of literature, including articles, proceedings, presentations, datasets and blog posts. The study explores the motivations behind citing, the changing meanings of citations, and highlights key milestones in the open citation movement, particularly focusing on initiatives like OpenCitations and the Initiative for Open Citations (I4OC).
Key findings indicate that open citations democratize research by providing free access to citation data, improving discoverability, and facilitating the creation of public citation graphs. Technological advancements, such as advanced data models and reference mining tools, have significantly contributed to the management and utilization of citation data. Despite these benefits, challenges such as ensuring data quality and standardization, addressing structural inequalities in citation networks, and achieving universal publisher adoption persist.
The study concludes with recommendations for future efforts, emphasizing policy advocacy, technological innovation, global collaboration, and educational initiatives to promote the widespread adoption and effective use of open citations. These strategies aim to make the “frozen footprints” of scholarly communication accessible to all, fostering a more equitable and transparent scientific landscape.",Sociology
1433,,"This study explores the concept of resilient joy, particularly humor, as a coping mechanism for journalists facing challenging work environments. Amidst the ongoing journalism crisis—marked by newspaper closures, job insecurity, and high emotional labor—many journalists continue their work, sustained by moments of joy and humor. Drawing on interviews with 21 U.S. journalists and building on Parks' (2021) theory of ""joy as a news value,"" this research investigates how humor not only serves as an emotional release but also fosters camaraderie in the newsroom, strengthens journalist-source relationships. The findings highlight humor's critical role in contributing to building a supportive work environment, enhancing job satisfaction, and allowing journalists to maintain engagement with their profession. By focusing on resilient joy, this study emphasizes the need to recognize joy and humor as essential components of journalistic practice, with the potential to improve both journalist well-being and the overall quality of journalism.",Sociology
1434,,"When conducting quantitative surveys, it is crucial to choose a research design that is tailored both to the target group and to the particular context. According to the literature, personalized salutations in survey invitations have a beneficial effect on response rate and consequently on data quality. However, in our case, the 2019/20 cohort of the DZHW Scientist Survey, it remained to be determined which personalized salutation is most suitable to the specific target group of scientists in Germany and whether there are differences according to subgroups such as academic status or gender. We argue that for many survey studies this question of specific tailoring for a target population arises. Also, because personalization necessitates a significantly increased effort for the collection and preparation of address data, it can be decisive to know whether or not there is an advantage over simple non-personalized forms of address. In the case of scientists in Germany we tested three different personalized forms of address at the beginning of the field phase with 20.000 invitees. Each of the three is associated with different social signals and requirements for address data, and compared with the benchmark of the non-personalized, but ingroup signalling salutation “Dear Colleague”. We find that, for all three status groups - professors, postdocs, and predocs - personalized salutations are associated with significantly higher response rates. However, the exact preferences for one form of personalization or another vary between these subgroups. The results from the experiment allowed us to precisely tailor salutations to subgroups for the remainder of the field phase, and to maximize the final overall response in the survey.",Sociology
1435,,"""Divided We Fall: A Multidisciplinary Analysis of Polarisation, Social Divides, and the Fragility of Unity in Human Societies"" explores the escalating threat of polarisation and tribalism in modern human societies. By examining historical case studies, such as Nazi Germany and McCarthyism, alongside contemporary events like Brexit and the U.S. elections of 2016 and 2024, the paper identifies recurring patterns in how societal divisions are exploited for political and ideological gain. The analysis integrates insights from social psychology, highlighting cognitive biases like confirmation bias, in-group/out-group dynamics and heuristic-driven decision-making, which leave individuals vulnerable to manipulation.
The paper also delves into the role of emerging technologies, such as social media and AI-driven propaganda, in amplifying divisions, creating echo chambers and eroding democratic norms. Beyond diagnosing the problem, it explores opportunities for fostering unity, drawing on historical examples of collective action, such as post-WWII reconstruction and the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings underscore the fragility of social cohesion and emphasize the urgent need for proactive leadership, media responsibility and grassroots mobilisation to counter polarisation. This multidisciplinary framework aims to provoke discussion on how humanity can navigate its growing divides and build resilience against future existential threats.


The paper also explores how modern technologies—such as social media algorithms and artificial intelligence—amplify polarization, creating echo chambers and eroding trust in democratic processes. Insights from social psychology, including heuristics, cognitive biases, and tribalism, highlight the vulnerabilities that make societies susceptible to manipulation. Finally, the paper discusses pathways to unity through shared goals, historical examples of successful collaboration, and the necessity of ethical leadership and robust institutions.

The findings underscore the urgent need for proactive measures to counteract polarization, emphasizing education, transparency, and collective action as essential tools for preserving democracy and fostering global unity in the face of existential threats such as climate change and technological disruption.",Sociology
1436,,"This paper uses the staggered implementation of gender quota policy in India to understand whether women who won office due to quotas go on to win higher-level office.   Indian local government elections impose mandatory gender quotas, but  state elections do not. This provides a setting to assess if there is an increase in women's representation at higher levels of governance due to quotas at the local level. The identification strategy  allows me to ascribe an increase of three percentage points in the share of women at the state-level  to gender quotas in local government. Additionally, to establish upward political mobility of local-level leaders I tracked political biographies of over 1000 women legislators  across India's 15 major state assemblies. In doing so, I identify that political dynasties, and ground-level leadership  --- those who  entered politics due to mandatory gender quotas --- are the two primary channels that enable  entry of women into state-level politics. Further, I show that the effect of democratic entry of women into politics via quotas is pronounced in states with parties that are reliant on empowered rank and file members.  Overall, these results highlight the importance of gender quotas as a democratic state-building tool and provide evidence for career advancement of women in politics  whose democratic entry into politics was facilitated by the implementation of mandatory gender quotas.",Sociology

1438,,"According to sociological modernization theory, the shift towards a more meritocratic society should reduce the impact of family background on education and increase the importance of individual abilities. Sibling correlations have been used as an omnibus indicator of the importance of families for socioeconomic outcomes. However, sibling similarities in education are influenced by both the siblings’ genetics and their shared environments, making it challenging to interpret changes over time. This study examines the changing contributions of genetic and environmental factors to educational attainment among Norwegian twins born from 1915 to 1991. Using administrative data on education for more than 13,000 twin pairs, we applied a Bayesian hierarchical liability threshold model to estimate the heritability and shared environmental influences on educational attainment across birth cohorts, while accounting for changes in the educational system and population distributions. For women, the heritability of educational attainment increased throughout the 20th century, whereas the influence of shared environmental factors decreased. This pattern corresponds with sociocultural changes that promoted gender equality and expanded educational opportunities for women. In contrast, men exhibited no significant changes in heritability or shared environmental influences over time. This study adds to the body of research on how genetic influences on educational outcomes do – and do not – differ across historical time and social context.",Sociology
1439,,"Economic independence from parents is increasingly delayed in the United States. This delay has implications for the timing and sequencing of other life transitions such as employment and marriage, and for inequalities in the support young adults receive. In this study, we leverage the Panel Study of Income Dynamics’ Transition to Adulthood Supplement on 1,081 young adults aged 18–28. Using sequence analysis, we examine how financial and co-residential support are embedded within the transition to adulthood. We study heterogeneity in support trajectories between and within families and disentangle the temporal order of transition to adulthood milestones. In line with existing theory on intergenerational transfers, parental economic support serves as both as an investment in young adults’ educational and economic pursuits and as a safeguard for struggling children. However, we also find evidence of more traditional, gendered pathways to economic independence linked to marriage: marriage facilitates economic independence and, for young men especially, achieving economic independence is an important precursor to marriage.",Sociology
1440,,"Previous research on correlates of the Social Progress Index in U.S. states was replicated among 100 countries where data is available. A multiple regression analysis indicates that social progress is correlated strongly to gross domestic product per capita divided by the cost of living and higher scores on a democracy index. Religious commitment, indicated by surveys of daily prayer, is correlated to less social progress. The research literature suggests that religious commitment leads to neglect of the prevention and treatment of diseases and injuries recommended by science, disdain for scientists, and acquiescence to or support of autocratic government. The trend toward autocracy in several democracies may lead to the deterioration of social progress. Increased global warming and the threat of nuclear winter depend disproportionately on the behavior of autocratic leaders in China, Russia, and the U.S. that neglect or deny the need to curb fossil use and express intent to expand their nuclear arsenals.",Sociology
1441,,"The use of information and communication technologies (ICT) is now an integral part of many occupational task profiles. Therefore, like mathematics and science, ICT represent an important content domain that adolescents may consider in their early vocational choices. Drawing on Eccles’ situated expectancy value theory and related theories, we hypothesize that adolescents’ ICT interest and self-concept should influence their vocational choices with respect to the intensity of ICT use in future occupations. Using longitudinal data from 1,964 Swiss adolescents transitioning into firm-based vocational education and training, we find strongly gendered patterns. Higher ICT interest predicts selection into occupations involving greater intensity of both basic and advanced ICT use, but only for girls. A more positive ICT self-concept is a significant predictor of greater occupational ICT use in future occupations only for boys, and this association is driven mainly by boys choosing careers as ICT specialists. Girls’ lower average ICT interest and their less positive ICT self-concepts explain almost half of the gender differences in the intensity of advanced ICT use. These findings emphasize that ICT are an important content domain of adolescents’ vocational choices today and highlight how gendered interests and self-concepts towards ICT perpetuate occupational gender segregation.",Sociology
1442,,"We suggest that labour market dualisation can be part of a liberalisation process employing a two-step methodology. First, we develop an eight-fold taxonomy to classify labour market protection reforms – covering employment, unemployment and collective protection – based on how they affect (de)commodification levels for insiders and outsiders. Second, through a comparative historical analysis over fifty years (1970-2020), we examine reform trajectories in Spain and Italy, two prominent examples of labour market dualism. We reveal a process of ‘liberalisation through dualisation’ characterised by two phases: (1) a shift from a declining Fordist order to dualisation, which primarily weakened outsiders’ protection, and (2) ‘downward convergence’ of protection for insiders. Spain and Italy shared this path but differed in the timing and characteristics of the legislative process. More broadly, we offer a replicable and transparent methodology to qualitatively code policy change and its intensity.",Sociology
1443,,"Background: Evidence shows that community group activities can support and improve health and wellbeing. However, research into the patterning of community engagement suggests that socioeconomic factors may act as barriers to participation. Yet, because this research has mainly been conducted in high-income, Western and Global North countries, it remains unclear whether these patterns are consistent across different countries and cultural settings, especially in Global South, low-middle income, and non-Western countries. Further, we do not know whether country-level socioeconomic factors influence community engagement.  

Methods: Data from 64,065 adult respondents in the World Values Survey were analysed to examine the association between individual-level (education, income, and employment) and country-level (years of compulsory education, GDP per capita, Gini coefficient, and unemployment) socioeconomic factors and community organization membership rates. Multilevel regression modelling was used. Further analyses tested the associations between active membership and various types of community organization memberships. Analyses were adjusted for age, gender, immigration status, household size and marital status. 

Results: Prevalence of community organization membership varies across countries. Kenya, Colombia and Mongolia have the highest numbers of memberships and Greece, Russia and Egypt have the lowest numbers. Individual education and perceived household income, and country-level income inequality and employment rate were all positively associated with group membership. Some variations by organization type were observed.

Conclusions: We found a universal social gradient in community organization membership, with individual education as the most influential predictor of more memberships across countries. Given that participation in community organizations can improve and support individual and community wellbeing, and plays a role in cultural and social capital development, reducing participatory disparities in these organizations could contribute to the reduction of health and social inequalities.",Sociology

Despite their significant role in the academic landscape, learned societies lack distinct recognition in global databases, which lowers their visibility and perceived impact. Using enhanced ISSN data and the existing ROR database, we present a methodology to identify learned societies based on their publishing activities and organizational names. Our approach is validated against national lists of societies from Austria, Finland, and the UK, demonstrating the feasibility and reliability of our method which, however, has several limitations discussed in the paper. Our findings show that 92% of 1,471 societies identified in ROR are currently assigned to ‘Other’ and ‘Nonprofit’ categories. We also highlight the geographical distribution and field-specific categorization of learned societies, emphasizing the diversity and scope of their influence. This paper contributes to the science of science field by proposing a framework that enhances the visibility and recognition of learned societies globally. Our research argues that ROR should consider enhancing their data schema to accommodate for learned societies. This way ROR can provide an open research information resource for identifying learned societies both for research and practical purposes.",Sociology

What is new is the laying of foundations in input-output accounts for modelling, potentially from the spatially macro and global scales and integrating via the meso city scale, to the micro, neighbourhood scale, but focussing here on building  fine-scale small-zone input-output accounts.

I review and catalog such potential criteria, then empirically explore researcher motivations for project choice through factor analysis of survey data from 409 authors of research articles in major public administration and public policy journals.  I find empirical support for personal gain, societal importance, and intellectual interest as research motivations.  These motivations do not neatly align with proposed ideal criteria for scientific choice.  Thus, such criteria must be translated to speak to researchers’ personal interests to achieve expression in individual scientific choice.",Sociology

However, trust is a multidimensional, rather than monolithic, concept, and the relative importance of different dimensions of trust in generating support for environmental management has not been fully explored. In this study, we use the trust ecology framework to examine the role of affinitive, dispositional, procedural, and rational trust in support for fisheries management among recreational anglers in the Great Lakes region of the United States. We found that all dimensions of trust positively correlate with support for management, with rational trust being the strongest predictor. Demographic factors such as age, gender, and race showed minimal impact compared to trust dimensions. Our findings underscore the multifaceted nature of trust and its critical role in resource management and suggest that building and maintain multiple dimensions of trust can enhance public support for environmental management, ultimately leading to more effective and resilient environmental governance.",Sociology
1448,,"Following a brief outline of labour-power through Marx, Ciccarelli (2021) and my own work, it is argued that the fragmentation of Marxist work on labour-power undermines what is critical for its understanding in contemporary society: the notion that labour-power is a ‘unity of the diverse’ (Marx). In Marxist theory and empirical work today, labour-power as ‘unity’, as a unified social force within humans, is sacrificed to its ‘diversity’. The result is theorisations and empirical research that split the study of labour-power into seemingly competing projects; either as arguments regarding whether the key focus should be on the social production of labour-power through education and training, or the social reproduction of labour-power through the family and domestic labour. This paper argues that labour–power is better viewed through its various diversities that constitute its unity. Each of these diversities is a spectral (but real) point in analysis of labour-power, but its unity blends the pinpointing analysis of its diversities. These labour-power diversities are social forms of its social re/production that are manifested in and through various institutions in capitalist society. In this light, the following diversities of labour-power and their institutional forms can be viewed directly through the work of Marx: the social production of labour-power (e.g. in education and training); its social reproduction 1 (e.g. through the family and domestic labour); social reproduction 2 (e.g. through state pensions, unemployment benefits); maintenance of labourers 1 (e.g. through consumption, food); maintenance of labourers 2 (e.g. through health, and mental health services). These labour-power diversities constitute a web of social forms shaping labour-power in contemporary capitalism. The paper ends by exploring some recent empirical examples illustrating how moving between the spectral points of labour–power and its diversities solidifies their unity in analysis.",Sociology

Given the increasing mobility and connectivity in today's world, these groups play a key role in building partnerships and promoting bilateral benefits through research and development. Our objectives in this study were 1) compile a comprehensive list of SDNs, detailing their goals, missions, and objectives, 2) evaluate overarching trends within these networks, specifically examining variations based on the network's age and the nature of relationships between host and origin countries, and 3) develop a flexible framework for the establishment of new SDNs across different countries, adapting to varying geopolitical and cultural landscapes.

Our results suggest that most SDNs are hosted in North America, predominantly involving high-income countries with strong alliances. African countries lack active SDNs, though existing general diaspora networks could evolve into STEM-focused subgroups. Significant innovation potential exists within choosing host countries (e.g., LMICs or neutral states) and mission focus (e.g., grand challenges). To be effective at the foreign policy level, SDNs need to have a large member base or targeted goals. Our framework, complemented by a synthesized objectives list, guides SDNs in establishing clear value propositions for members and partners, enhancing their role in science diplomacy and addressing global challenges.",Sociology

However, this hypothesis appears arbitrary, especially relative to recent elections where the Keys have been successful. This article instead postulates a Structuralist argument – functioning to describe innate administrative normativities (the structure of government as described by its electoral and legislative composition) – which hinges on the consistency that Lichtman interpreted (particularly in his introductory work with Keilis-Borok) in showing the Keys to be a consistent model; the Keys are further shown to be unswayed by projected collective social proclivities.",Sociology

1452,,"System avoidance refers to the tendency of individuals who are concerned about formal social control (e.g., incarceration, immigration enforcement, or the removal of children from their families) to avoid surveilling institutions that engage in recordkeeping. While this research locates concerns about formal social control in an individual’s sanctionable status, the laws, policies, and practices that generate the threat of formal social control vary across space and time. Drawing on theories of legal consciousness, this article posits that spatial and temporal variation in the threat of formal social control has differential associations with whether and to what degree individuals with a sanctionable status report involvement in surveilling institutions. Our empirical case is U.S. immigration policing, which burdens Latinos across citizenship statuses. We link individual-level data on institutional involvement from the American Time Use Survey with administrative data on immigration policing across state-years. Results from double- hurdle models show that Latinos in state-years with higher rates of immigration policing (1) are less likely to report involvement in surveilling institutions but, (2) conditional on any involvement, do not vary in the time reported involved. We evaluate variations by nativity, citizenship status, institution, and the presence of sanctuary policies that circumscribe immigration policing. We conclude that the threat of formal social control across space and time implicates the situational meanings of institutional involvement for subordinated populations.",Sociology
1453,,"For science and technology to contribute to social justice, scientometrics analyses need to be able to produce descriptions that are appropriate to specific contexts and values. Given that the participation of stakeholders in the analyses is crucial for these perspectives to be realized, this requires research information analyses that are “open”. In this paper, we propose that this “openness” in research information concerns several dimensions. In the first place, research information should be open in the sense of being transparent and accessible. Second, research information should be open in the sense of being inclusive and diverse, which includes two dimensions: that stakeholders can actually use it, and that the contents include different types of knowledge. Third, the research information should be provided in forms that empower interrogation by stakeholders, so that they can retrieve and construct the descriptions of science and technology that are more appropriate for their context. This last step implies efforts to make visible many scientific contributions from the global south which are currently invisible.

1455,,"Prefazione al volume di Cristina Burini, Governare lo spazio pubblico nelle città italiane. Patti di collaborazione e imprese di comunità tra convivialità ed efficacia collettiva (FrancoAngeli 2025). I patti di collaborazione e le imprese di comunità regolano le attività e la governance di alcuni spazi pubblici. Alla ricerca di una espressione di sintesi per riprendere molti dei temi fin qui discussi, potremmo semplicemente dire che, quando governato in maniera partecipativa, lo spazio pubblico, può essere considerato un servizio pubblico. Come per tutti i servizi pubblici, la posta in gioco sta nella loro regolazione, e quindi nel modo in cui sono normate, contrattualizzate, remunerate, controllate e sanzionate le forme di gestione: in altri termini la loro governance. Cosi riconcettualizzato, lo spazio pubblico non è un luogo passivo di transito e interazione superficiale, ma un servizio pubblico che deve essere realmente accessibile: la vera sfida per le politiche urbane e la gestione degli spazi pubblici è riconoscere e valorizzare questa dimensione di servizio, dove l’accessibilità va oltre la semplice possibilità di entrare fisicamente in uno spazio e include la capacità di interagire, esprimersi e ricevere riconoscimento. Per questo manutenzione e sicurezza - elementi spesso visti solo come questioni tecniche - sono responsabilità comuni di amministrazioni pubbliche e comunità attive. Pensare lo spazio pubblico come un servizio pubblico richiede di riconoscere che la sua qualità e la sua sostenibilità dipendono dalla capacità delle politiche e delle comunità di co-creare uno spazio che sia accessibile non solo in termini fisici, ma anche sociali e culturali. In questo modo, la dimensione del riconoscimento reciproco e della reciprocità dissonante diventa centrale, rendendo lo spazio pubblico un luogo in cui le differenze possono essere accolte e integrate attraverso un processo di continua negoziazione e regolazione condivisa. In sintesi, la convivialità, la cura nella gestione e il mantenimento degli spazi pubblici non sono solo condizioni per un buon clima sociale, ma rappresentano le fondamenta per una socializzazione civica autentica. Questi spazi comuni, dove le differenze sono non solo tollerate ma accolte e integrate, diventano il perno di una cittadinanza partecipativa. Le identità collettive che emergono da questo processo, basate su un attaccamento emotivo e personale, mostrano il potenziale trasformativo degli spazi pubblici: luoghi dove l’agire quotidiano (Citroni, 2023) e le relazioni sociali contribuiscono a una coesione sociale che va oltre la semplice coabitazione, verso un’esperienza di comunità dinamica e inclusiva. Ecco la posta in gioco di una governance urbana di qualità. Indice del capitolo: 1. Lo spazio pubblico, non accessorio ma a fondamento del legame civile 2.

1456,,"To minimise confounding bias and facilitate the identification of unwarranted disparities, sentencing researchers have traditionally sought to control for as many legal factors as possible. In this article we challenge such approach. Using causal graphs we show how controlling for commonly used variables in the sentencing literature can introduce bias. Instead, we propose a new modelling framework that clarifies which types of controls are necessary to identify different definitions of sentencing disparities. We apply this framework to the estimation of race disparities in the US federal courts and gender disparities in the England and Wales magistrates’ court. We find that the model uncertainty associated to the choice of controls is substantial for gender disparities and for race disparities affecting Hispanic offenders, rendering estimates of the latter inconclusive. Disparities against black offenders are more consistent, although, they are not strong enough to be seen as definitive evidence of racial discrimination.",Sociology
1457,,"Traditionally, linguistics has focused primarily on human communication through visual and auditory modalities, while sensory modalities such as olfaction and gustation are relatively underutilized in human interaction, a trend influenced by evolutionary and societal factors. In contrast, animals employ a broad array of sensory modes in communication—olfactory, gustatory, photic, electromagnetic, and acoustic—thereby engaging in multimodal exchanges beyond the conventional realm of human language. This article reviews scientific discoveries, such as the role of pheromones in insect behavior and animals’ perception of electromagnetic fields and spectrums, to reveal the richness of multimodal and supralinguistic communication in animals, highlighting the limitations within human communication. Inspired by these sensory communication models, we explore how future technologies might expand human sensory capacity, especially in olfaction, taste, vision, and touch, enhancing the multimodal experience in human interaction. Through technological advancements, such as augmented reality, virtual reality, electronic noses, tongues, and brain-computer interfaces, humans could adopt more diverse forms of supralinguistic communication, thus surpassing the limitations of traditional language and achieving a more comprehensive understanding of the natural world. This study aims to envisage, from a linguistic perspective, the possibilities of sensory-enhanced communication through technological development, fostering a revolutionary transformation in human perception and communication and enriching the research domain of linguistics.",Sociology

The anticipated benefits of CAVs are numerous and include making transportation accessible to all, reducing accidents due to human error, optimising traffic flow, and creating new industries and job opportunities. Autonomous driving capabilities in CAVs rely on advanced sensor technology and AI-driven analytics, which process data from multiple sensors to navigate, perceive the surrounding environment, detect obstacles, and make driving decisions in real-time. Despite the many benefits, CAVs will be highly vulnerable to a wide variety of crimes unless security measures are implemented by design. To understand the potential threats, this study introduces the enabling technology and reference architecture for CAVs and reports the findings from an extensive scoping review of the available literature. This covers reported crime incidents, academic literature on potential threats, a survey of academic survey papers on CAV security, and a review of papers concerned with cyberattacks against CAVs published in the past five years. The findings from the review are complemented by the findings from a workshop with experts about which of the identified threats should be prioritised for the purposes of crime reduction. The findings indicate that a wide range of cyber-attacks and offences are possible, and that the threat landscape is continually expanding due to insufficient attention being given to security during the development of the technology. Suggestions for policy and priorities for future work are suggested.",Sociology
1459,,"The study focuses on the temporal differences (30 years on average) between ethnic
groups migrating from the Austro-Hungarian Empire to the U.S. between 1850 and
1910. In our study, we argue that the main factor that led to differences in the timing
of emigration was the differences in regional economic development of different ethnic
groups living in different regions of the Empire. Migration costs: before the 1864 introduction
of steam engine technology in transatlantic maritime transport, emigration
costs were not affordable for Hungarians and Slovaks due to the sea and land voyage
high ticket prices. Therefore, with more resources, Austrians and Czechs could afford
to migrate earlier. However, after the introduction of steamship technology and the
technological change in ship engines, travel became more affordable due to reduced
ticket prices, faster voyages, and increased capacity. This allowed Hungarians and Slovaks
from poorer regions to begin migrating in larger numbers as migration became
economically feasible. In this study, we utilise a complete count of the U.S. Census
records from 1900 and 1910 (Helgertz et al., 2023; Ruggles et al., 2021), which Integrated

1460,,"This paper investigates the implications of high HI35 days, which increase the demand for water and energy supplies, overconsumption, and higher emissions induced by cooling demand. Socially, HI35 is associated with health morbidity and loss in labor productivity; hence, policies directed at protection of the well-being of the poor, such as improved access to health care and good working conditions, become increasingly relevant. Extreme heat, besides, accelerates resource competition that may further develop into a civil instability, which affects governance structures. The nation will be assisted in addressing the impacts brought forward by HI35 through resilient infrastructure policy, good governance practice, and sustainable resource management. This paper, therefore, concludes that integrated policy action in ESG will be urgently needed to address the risk from extreme heat and calls for adaptive strategies that move toward environmental sustainability, social equity, and effective governance. Finally, HI35 is helpful to guide policy responses against different and interwoven challenges of extreme heat on sustainable development.",Sociology
1461,,"The present research has delved deeper into the complex relationship of customer care calls with purchasing behavior in a WM system and has developed actionable insights to optimize operations. In this regard, the following critical factors have been considered: product attributes-cost, weight, and discount-on one hand, and delivery performance in terms of timeliness and reliability on the other, with a view to understand their impacts on customer satisfaction and interactions. Key takeaways are that high volumes of customer care calls reflect operational failure; there is a delay or expectation mismatch, and hence one needs strong process optimization. Also, heavy products, since perceived to be reliable, have fewer customer enquiries; lighter, cheap products cause more frequent queries since impulsive buying and lack of information occur. It further identifies timeliness of delivery as a main determinant of customer satisfaction while delays in delivery result in heightened discontent and rising demands for support. The study underlines the strategic relevance of advanced analytics, machine learning, and real-time monitoring to finally resolve the recurring inefficiencies. This may also be a good basis on which recommendations could be made concerning the use of predictive analytics for demand forecasting, effective logistical frameworks, and methods of customer service that would be in line with product-specific needs. Discounts become a two-edged factor: enhancing satisfaction but threatening brand value when used too frequently. In the end, strategies with discounts should be put into balance, proactive customer engagement should be there, with crystal clear communications with them, and the products to be more correctly described. The given study also identified how a warehouse clears the expectation from customers by applying data-driven strategies for better efficiency, customer satisfaction, and long-term loyalty. The above findings provide a comprehensive road map on how to integrate technology and customer-centric strategies in modern warehouse management.",Sociology

Modern metasurfaces, on the other hand, are two-dimensional structures designed with nanometer or micrometer precision to achieve highly controlled manipulation of electromagnetic waves. This paper aims to explore the connection between character patterns and metasurfaces in aspects such as energy regulation, information encoding, and cultural symbolism, while further analyzing their multidimensional impact on technology, culture, ethics, and practical applications. By comparing the historical background, cultural significance of character patterns, and the physical principles of modern metasurfaces, the paper reveals commonalities between the two in energy resonance, information transmission, and geometric symmetry. Furthermore, the paper delves into the role of character patterns in psychology and socio-culture, as well as their inspirational significance for metasurface technology design. Finally, the paper discusses the ethical and socio-cultural adaptability of metasurface technology, providing valuable insights for future scientific research and practical applications.",Sociology

However, the connection between quantum mechanics and the social sciences, particularly linguistics, has not been widely explored. This paper draws analogies between the discrete nature, superposition states, and entanglement phenomena in quantum mechanics, and the discreteness, ambiguity, and context-dependence in linguistics, revealing interdisciplinary similarities between the two fields. This analogy provides a new perspective for understanding the uncertainty and complexity involved in human language processing, and suggests the possible existence of macroscopic quantum states.

Using unique wealth survey data from Austria, we uncover a significant bias in self-assessed distributional ranks. Our estimates indicate that individuals who underestimate their wealth rank have a savings rate approximately 50% higher than those who assess their rank accurately. Preferences that feature relative wealth in the utility function can explain this relationship. Our findings inform contemporary macroeconomic models and contribute to understanding the impact of information bubbles on economic decisions.

1465,,"Scholars from a wide array of disciplines have sought to identify the core features underpinning cohesion and cooperation within increasingly large, complex, and internally diverse societies. Previous work has suggested that as societies grow in scale and complexity, extreme forms of inequality  no longer provide a viable method of maintaining cohesion and cooperation. The relationship between these supposedly critical features, however, has not been subjected to large-scale systematic analysis. Here, we investigate the rise, spread, and impact of cooperation-promoting institutions and ideologies in a global sample of past societies. We find a clear divergence in the evolutionary trajectories of these traits: on one hand, certain ideological features relating to the adoption of moralizing religions, increasing complexity and professionalization of governmental administration, and maintenance of public goods clearly arise and spread alongside increases in social scale; on the other, ideologies and institutions limiting rulers’ power and authority are not uniformly characteristic of larger-scale societies. We discuss a range of possible interpretations for these patterns, noting that the forces driving these developments may operate on different scales of analysis and time-courses and suggest tentative explanations for these critical dynamics.",Sociology
1466,,"Estimates of intergenerational educational mobility are generally computed using a combination of self- and proxy-reports of one's and one's parents' education. Such reports are easily collected, offering a cost-effective alternative to collecting multiple self-reports or register data. However, the bias that proxy-reports could introduce in the measurement of intergenerational educational mobility is rarely assessed. Our study fills this gap and assesses how reliable people are when they report their parents' or their child's educational attainment. We find that both parents and children tend to underestimate the educational distance between themselves and their family members, thus inflating estimates of educational reproduction. This trend is larger when children act as proxy-reporters. Another limitation of using children’s proxy-reported information is the number of missing answers, which is lower when parents are asked to proxy-report their child's education. In a simulation exercise, we establish that the bias introduced by proxy reports is not negligible, with self-reported intergenerational regression coefficients being 16\% higher when a proxy-report is used.",Sociology

bombing to assess the long-term impact of the Vietnam War on Vietnamese women’s
attitudes toward intimate partner violence (IPV). To establish a causal link between
war exposure and IPV attitudes, I use a province’s distance to the arbitrarily drawn
border between North Vietnam and South Vietnam as an instrument for bombing
intensity in that province. I find that women living in heavily bombed provinces are
more likely to accept IPV. The instrumental variable estimates are greater in magnitude
compared to the ordinary least squares estimates across various specifications, pointing
to measurement error in conflict exposure. Exposure to bombing does not seem to make
women more tolerant of IPV through education or marital matching. Instead, the war
is likely to directly affect women’s views about IPV because of the normalization of
and desensitization to violence in the private sphere.",Sociology
1468,,"As buildings become more energy efficient due to construction and technological improvements and stricter regulations, the impact of construction and maintenance materials is gaining prominence in the life cycle emissions of buildings. In high-income countries like Norway, renovation of the existing building stock is crucial for reducing overall environmental impacts. However, there is a lack of comprehensive data on the life cycle assessment (LCA) of Norwegian buildings, especially concerning material use and embodied emissions. Building archetypes offer a solution by providing structured background data to enhance LCA studies. This paper addresses this gap by examining the space heating demand and material use of residential building archetypes in Norway, categorized by type and construction cohort. Dynamic energy simulations were conducted using EnergyPlus, combined with the BuildME Python package for material aggregation and calculation. Our results show that structural components dominate the material intensity (MI) of most archetypes, particularly in buildings with basements. Multi-family houses (MFHs) built after 1991 outperform single-family houses (SFHs) and apartment blocks (ABs) in both MI and material per person (MpP). Renovating SFHs to accommodate more occupants could reduce their MpP while maintaining a comfortable living environment. The higher MI in ABs, driven by concrete floor decks, suggests that using wood in future constructions could significantly lower both MI and MpP, reducing resource use and embodied emissions. This work links energy performance with material efficiency, offering valuable data for improving policy and practices in the Norwegian building sector.",Sociology

The qualitative analysis shows both similarities and differences in how applicants in the two fields claim risks: in both fields, the most prominent notions refer to results and methodologies. While results at risk are interpreted similarly, methodological risks differ between the two fields. The analysis also reveals a greater variety of different risks in the SSH compared to the NSC. The paper suggests that research policy and science studies should avoid treating “riskiness” as a given and consider different notions of risk across a disciplinary spectrum that includes the SSH.",Sociology
1470,,"As automated decision-making permeates almost all aspects of everyday life, capabilities to generate meaningful explanations for various stakeholders (i.e., decision-makers, addressees of decisions including individuals, auditors, and regulators) should be carefully deployed. This paper presents a typology of explanations intended to support the first pillar of an explainability-by-design strategy. Its production has been achieved by pursuing a responsible innovation approach and introducing a new persona within the research and innovation process, i.e., a legal engineer, whose role is to work at the interface of two teams, the compliance and the engineering teams and to oversee the process of requirement elicitation, which is often opinionated and narrowing. Once explanation requirements have been derived from applicable regulatory requirements, compliance rules or business policies, they have been mapped to the dimensions of the typology to produce fine-grained explanation requirements, forming computable building blocks that can then be translated into system requirements during the technical design phase. The typology has been co-created with industry partners operating in two sectors: finance and education. Two pilot studies have thus been conducted to test both the feasibility of the generation and computation of explanations on the basis of the typology and the usefulness of the outputs in the light of the state of the art. The typology comprises nine hierarchical dimensions. It can be leveraged to operate a stand-alone classifier of explanations that acts as detective controls within a broader partially-automated compliance strategy. A machine-readable format of the typology is provided in the form of a light ontology.",Sociology
1471,,"Background. There is a paucity of research that has examined how significant health, social, and environmental crises impact suicidal ideation, particularly where these events co-occur and have potentially synergistic adverse effects. The aim of this study was to identify the unique and cumulative contributions of mental health, social, and environmental risks on 12-month trajectories of suicidal ideation. 

Methods. A community-based sample of 1928 Australians (aged ≥16 years) completed online surveys measuring mental health, social, and environmental risk factors, and suicidal ideation at baseline, and the suicidal ideation measure was repeated at four follow-up timepoints.

Results. Analyses showed five different trajectories of suicidal ideation (one stable low ideation trajectory; four vulnerable trajectories). A different set of risk factor variables predicted each vulnerable trajectory relative to the low trajectory. A cumulative risk index representing the combined effects of the mental health, social, and environmental risk factors also predicted each vulnerable trajectory relative to the low trajectory.

Conclusions. While adversity resulting from exposure to health and environmental crises was associated with suicidal ideation, the heterogeneity in how patterns of mental health, social, and environmental factors related to trajectory classes suggests that people experience these events differently. A cumulative risk index may be a potentially useful indicator of risk.",Sociology
1472,,"Regional inequality in Peru represents one of the most significant challenges to
achieving sustainable economic growth and social cohesion. This paper explores
the historical, economic, social, and institutional causes of regional disparities,
examining how geography and resource distribution have led to uneven development across the country. Drawing on the historical legacy of colonialism,
the analysis reveals how extractive economic models and centralized governance
have perpetuated inequality, disproportionately affecting rural and indigenous
regions such as the Andean highlands and the Amazon basin.
The study assesses the economic effects of regional inequality, including its
impact on national growth, labor market inefficiencies, and vulnerability to external shocks. Social effects are examined in terms of reduced social cohesion,
internal migration, and increased social conflicts, particularly in areas rich in
natural resources. The paper also evaluates the implications for human development, focusing on gaps in education, healthcare, and quality of life that
perpetuate cycles of poverty and limit opportunities for upward mobility.
To address these disparities, the paper proposes several strategies aimed
at promoting inclusive development. These include investment in sustainable
infrastructure to improve connectivity and access to resources, economic diversification to reduce dependence on volatile extractive sectors, strengthening of
education and healthcare services to bridge social gaps, and enhancing regional
governance to optimize decentralization and resource management.
The paper concludes by emphasizing the importance of reducing regional
inequality for the sustainable development of Peru. It argues that equitable
development is essential for fostering national unity, economic resilience, and
social well-being. Future research directions are also identified, including the
impact of climate change on regional inequality, the role of digital technology
in bridging gaps, and the potential for community-based approaches to resource
management. By understanding and addressing the root causes of inequality,
Peru can lay the foundation for a more inclusive and prosperous future for all

1473,,"This paper develops the concept of the hyper-capitalist urban node (HCUN) as a new theoretical framework for understanding how financial capitalism transforms contemporary cities. Through systematic analysis of London's economic, social, and technological changes from 1992 to 2023, we demonstrate that global financial centres have evolved beyond established models of the global city. Drawing on comprehensive longitudinal data, we identify six distinctive characteristics of HCUNs: financial sector dominance, extreme income polarisation, housing financialisation, the political-financial nexus, technological acceleration, and social-spatial transformation. London's empirical evidence demonstrates how these characteristics manifest in concrete terms through dramatic shifts in employment structure, housing markets, income distribution, and spatial organisation. We argue that HCUNs represent not merely a quantitative intensification of existing urban processes, but rather a qualitative shift in how cities function within global capitalism. The analysis reveals fundamental contradictions within the HCUN model, explaining why conventional urban policies often fail to achieve their intended outcomes. Through this research, we advance both theoretical understanding of contemporary urban transformation and methodological approaches to studying it, including the development of the HCUN Index. Our findings demonstrate the need for fundamental innovation in urban theory and governance to address the distinctive challenges posed by financial capitalism's intensifying influence over urban development.",Sociology

This study provides a quantitative assessment of the Chinese government-sponsored international mobility program, the Chinese Scholarship Council (CSC), by examining its effects on home and host countries across disciplines from five dimensions: research activity, collaboration patterns, funding patterns, research performance and security-sensitive research. Our findings suggest that, for the home country (China), the funding program enhances China’s research capabilities in alignment with China’s strategic development priorities. Additional evidence suggests that the funding program facilitates international collaboration and allows awardees to work with well cited researchers. For host countries, the funding program promotes collaboration with China and supports research areas where funding might be scarce. Also, the funding program places little emphasis on dual-use research and has minimal ties to the “Seven Sons of National Defense” universities. The finding may help mitigate current concerns of some host countries about the potential further threats to security. The study provides evidence for policymakers to develop strategies that maximize the benefits of international mobility programs and address associated challenges.",Sociology
1475,,"Although research in the STEM field has extensively examined its gendered characteristics, the vast majority of the literature has concentrated on educational transitions and young adults. More limited attention has been devoted to the longer-term work-family trajectories of STEM majors, and how these are linked to gender earnings gaps. In response, we exploit Finnish register data to identify the most common work-family trajectories followed by college educated men and women with STEM majors in ages 30–40 (N=150,796). Given marked differences in gender proportions across STEM fields, we distinguish computer science and engineering majors from natural science majors. In a second step, we assess gender differences in the returns to distinct work-family trajectories and within-gender differences. We report three main findings. First, women are able to combine a career in computer science and engineering and having children. Second, across occupations, mothers earn considerably less than fathers. This suggests that even though women can combine work and family, they do not benefit in terms of earnings. Third, beyond uncovering gender gaps, we show that a major mechanism underlying parental gender gaps is that men receive notable fatherhood premiums across work trajectories. For women, findings reveal more heterogeneous patterns. Among computer science and engineering majors, women have similar earnings across trajectories. Conversely, women with natural science majors gain from working in computer science and engineering.",Sociology
1476,,"An examination of public space provides insights into the disconnection between regulation and reception within the Parisian context. The visibility of refugees in public spheres has been instrumental in heightening civic consciousness in Paris. Simultaneously, it serves as a subject of political apprehension and an opportunity for the display of state-inflicted violence by humanitarian NGOs, too. The governance of public open spaces extends beyond traditional command and control approaches, emphasizing delegation, integration of new knowledge and technologies, negotiation, and self-regulation. The central concern involves an evolving, albeit ambiguous and partially contradictory, process of outsourcing certain aspects of reception policies without a well-experienced governance mode (Artioli, Le Galès, 2023).
The first section describes the relevant social geography of Paris. Social transformations due to deindustrialization have left a lasting impact, concentrating immigrant populations in areas marked by blue-collar workers and social housing estates. While Paris actively engages in social and redistributive policies, achieving a balanced geographical distribution for diverse social groups remains a challenge.
The ensuing section delineates the social policy responsibilities of both central and local institutions, against the backdrop of which the handling of refugees has transformed into a separate specific policy domain. Despite ongoing collaboration in Paris, challenges endure due to the stance of the French government and the inadequate coordination within the EU.
The following three sections analyse the role of space in framing the reception policies of Paris, paying reference to different ways of framing the space:
-	The so-called ‘Project Territories’ of the EU Structural Funds exhibit a progressive drift where coalitions of territorial actors reinterpret national rules following their competencies (and expertise). 
-	Locally managed reception comes to a standstill in the face of state normative injunctions. 
-	Government authorities and local actors consciously use space for repressive purposes, even to manage conflicts between potentially incompatible uses.
The conclusions deal with the evolving landscape of local reception policies driven by state and non-state actors. Despite innovative efforts, there is a lack of coherence, and central dispersion policies (Dollet, 2023) contradict local commitments, raising questions about the role of local governance. However, the cyclical coming and going between the dismantling of refugee camps and sheltering asylum seekers question the notion and scope of integration, highlighting the porous boundary between formal and informal regulations. Besides, the design of policies cannot underestimate the role of space in shaping welcoming practices.",Sociology
1477,,"Background: There is an internationally accepted discourse on ‘Female Genital Mutilation’ which understands it as a human rights violation, a major health concern, and an extreme form of gendered violence. Since the 1980s, African women, postcolonial feminists and anthropologists have critiqued this discourse as ethnocentric and racist. 
Aims: We examine the genealogy of the hegemonic anti-FGM discourse, identify alternative perspectives and analyse the extent to which they were integrated, co-opted, disregarded or silenced. 
Materials and methods: This genealogy draws upon a comprehensive review of the literature critiquing the dominant discourse on FGM, supplemented through analyses of British Colonial Office correspondence, documents from the (Parliamentary) ‘Committee for the Protection of Coloured Women in the Crown Colonies’, Church Missionary Society periodicals, debates in the UK Houses of Parliament, and UN (including WHO) reports and meeting minutes.
Results: Alternative perspectives on female circumcision and critiques of the dominant narrative have been formulated throughout the history of the anti-FGM campaign. However, they have been silenced through various silencing mechanisms, and thus not permeated the hegemonic discourse. Outrage and backlash continue as silencing mechanisms around two contentious topics that embody colonial double standards: medicalised female circumcision and adult women’s right to choose female circumcision.",Sociology
1478,,"It is broadly accepted among political scientists, political sociologists, and social movement theorists that a unified group will have a higher probability of success than a group that experiences internal divisions or fragmentation. Similarly, it has been assumed that in a society with a relatively unified elite, the elite will experience disproportionately higher benefits relative to the larger population. We take issue with this claim. In the mid-twentieth century, large American corporations exhibited a relatively high level of unity but the relative economic benefits accruing to the elite were at historic lows. In more recent years, American big business has become increasingly fragmented, yet the economic benefits that these elites have received have reached historic highs, and the average American’s standard of living has stagnated. Drawing on Padgett and Ansell, we introduce the concept of inadvertent robust action to explain how a relatively fragmented, disorganized elite can reap benefits that exceed those that its more unified counterparts experienced in an earlier era. We conclude with a discussion of the conditions under which our formulation can be expected to hold.",Sociology

Despite this substantial body of empirical research, the knowledge is fragmented across disciplines, emphasizing the need for integration to establish a cohesive framework. As laying the groundwork for a unified framework begins with identifying relevant phenomena, this systematic review analyzed 4019 research articles using text mining to detect phenomena associated with radicalization. Author keywords and abstracts were analyzed by examining term frequency as an indicator of relevance and term co-occurrence as an indicator of association. The results reflect themes commonly featured in theory, such as ideology, identity, and social networks, but also identified themes not well-developed in theory. Macro-level phenomena, including the role of the state, economy, elections, policy, and regional factors, as well as micro- and meso-level phenomena like the internet, social media, adolescence, personality, language, education, and mental health, are not sufficiently embedded in theory. The findings further provide the first empirical evidence confirming the fragmentation of research on radicalization.

Prosecutors have significant discretion at the front-end of the criminal legal system, including over charges, bail recommendations, and plea deals. Although prosecutors have traditionally wielded their power in a way that contributes to mass incarceration, “progressive” prosecutors have been elected in growing numbers since 2016 on pledges to mitigate the racialized harms of the criminal legal system. While scholars tie the rise of progressive prosecutors to the Movement for Black Lives (BLM), less is known about the countermovements efforts – such as recalls, impeachments, and suspensions – challenging these prosecutors’ discretion and tenures. To address this gap, I constructed an original database of all local prosecutors in 2012 and/or 2022 in the country's 300 most-populous jurisdictions. Through archival research, I documented prosecutor demographics, state politics, and unusual opposition, which I define as organized efforts to remove prosecutors from office or constrain their power outside of regularly-scheduled elections. Findings reveal that unusual opposition disproportionately targets women of color prosecutors, disproportionately occurs in Republican-controlled states, and has nearly tripled over the last decade. I argue that unusual opposition is a novel movement repertoire used by the political right to legally mobilize against racial justice efforts following BLM.",Sociology

Do these coalitions, consisting of large-scale actors, have the capacities to contribute to the transformations that are needed, or do they perpetuate the same system dynamics that created the problem in the first place? We investigate this question by comparing publicly available information for five coalitions working with financial and food systems sustainability. This paper examines whether large-scale actor coalitions (LSACs) may contribute to transformations towards equitable and sustainable futures. We use a ‘rapid assessment’ 20-variable framework to collect and analyze empirical data from five food and finance coalitions to identify their roles and capacities for transformative change. Our results indicate that LSACs implement distinct strategies to reach their goals. More specifically, due to their diverse set-ups, LSACs have the ability to raise awareness of sustainability issues, utilize ties to push forward agendas, experiment with solutions and showcase promising niche initiatives. We examine strategies undertaken by LSACs that can enable other change makers working to transform the food and finance systems, contributing to systems with high and diverse capacities for transformative change. We also identify potential capacity gaps within the studied LSACs, which might hinder the creation of enabling conditions for transformative change within the food and finance sectors.",Sociology

While much of this research has focused on nuclear families, less is known about patterns in stepfamilies. This study adopts a dyadic perspective to explore how parental partnership quality relates to the wellbeing of children living with both biological parents versus those with a biological parent and a stepparent. We apply multivariable linear regression and a mediation analysis on longitudinal data from the German Panel Analysis of Intimate Relationships and Family Dynamics (pairfam) to understand the relationship between family structure, step- and biological parent’s partnership quality and children’s self-reported wellbeing, operationalised over the Strength and Difficulties questionnaire (SDQ-scores). The analytical sample includes children who live in heterosexual couple households (n=1,781). We differentiate two separate dimensions of parental partnership quality, namely the frequency of conflict and esteem between the (step-)parents. Results show that children living with a stepparent exhibit higher total difficulties score compared to children living with both their biological parents. However, parental conflict occurs less and esteem more frequently in stepfamilies than in nuclear families. Mediation analysis indicates that partnership quality partially mediates the impact of family structure on SDQ scores. Our analysis suggests that the negative effect of living with stepparents on children’s socio-emotional wellbeing is slightly mitigated by increased parental esteem and lower conflict in these unions.",Sociology

1484,,"Three out of five Australian renters say they expect they will never own their own home — a significant shift that requires rethinking of tax and housing systems so that governments’ support all Australians in a two tier housing market (of owners and renters) into retirement, according to new AHURI research.

The policy challenge is to make renting a good, long-term housing outcome for renters, particularly lower-income, older renters with limited superannuation. The research highlights that in the Australian Housing Aspirations (AHA) survey a large majority (78%) of private rental tenants aspired to own their own home, while the research survey found three out of five (59%) private renters don’t think they will ever be able to afford to buy a home of their own.

Currently, homeowners receive tax concessions that are not available to renters. Examples include no capital gains tax on the sale of the primary residence (which becomes a form of wealth accumulation) and no tax on the imputed rental income of owner occupied housing. Conversely, renters are required to pay rent after income tax.

A fairer housing and tax system (for retirement investment) could see some lower income private renters compensated for living long-term in the sector. This support could come through the provision of non-property investment opportunities (to reduce households’ need to 'rentvest') or targeted superannuation benefits.

Sustained underinvestment in social housing stock has also had long-term negative implications for all Australians and additional public housing construction is needed as a priority, together with policies to support private developers increasing the supply of affordable housing. In addition, a more immediate goal for policy development is to reform legislation controlling private tenancies so as to have better protections for tenants.",Sociology

This briefing paper summarises the findings from the one of the strands of the ‘Beyond Left Behind Places’ project, which involved quantitative analysis of residential migration patterns in economically ‘left behind’ regions in the UK, France, and Germany during the immediate pre-COVID period. In addition, we conducted qualitative research with residents of economically ‘left behind’ regions in the three countries to get their perceptions. We use national administrative and census data for the three countries to examine whether economically lagging regions tend to lose or gain population through migration, and what age groups are moving in or out.  Economic theories often assume that individuals migrate from economically lagging regions to areas offering better economic conditions. But actually, economically lagging regions in the UK, France and Germany generally tend to experience net population inflows. In other words, more people are moving to these regions than are moving out. In fact, when it comes to internal migration (i.e. people moving within the same country), these lagging regions tend to attract more new residents, on average, than more economically successful regions do.",Sociology

Instead, they are all options from which one or more may be claimed as an ethnoracial identity, and they include an additional Middle Eastern/North African category among the list of options. It is no longer necessary to claim or reject a racial category for oneself to claim a solely Hispanic/Latina/e/o ethnic identity, which means that the current and prior schemes for ethnoracial identity are neither equivalent nor directly comparable.",Sociology
1487,,"Street names are not neutral identifiers to navigate through cities but are charged with strong symbolic connotations and reflect power relations within society. A growing body of geographic scholarship documents a strong gender bias in the urban namespace, where women only represent a small fraction of streets named after people. This article investigates whether the lack of women in political decision-making roles contributes to explaining their marginalization in urban toponyms. More specifically, we study the impact of the gender and ideology of town mayors on their decisions to commemorate women in the street map. Focusing on the universe of Spanish towns during the period 2001-2023, we find through fixed effects panel data models and regression discontinuity design that the mayor’s gender does not affect the percentage of female-named streets, while the ideology of the governing party does. Our findings thus indicate that it is ideology rather than gender what shapes politicians’ preferences regarding the commemoration of women in the street map. We argue that this is because, on the one hand, strong political parties can impose their agenda on local leaders, making irrelevant differences in their gender and, on the other, the ideological cleavage is more relevant than the gender one to account for differences in attitudes towards symbolic gender policies. A natural implication of our results is that simply having more female politicians will hardly suffice to address the gender gap in street names and in other symbolically charged policies.",Sociology

This article explores empirically the influence of legal scholars on the development of inter?national investment law through a combined legal-empirical and sociological approach designed to capture the multidirectional nature of influence. It relies on a novel database of all citations to legal scholarship in International Centre for the Settlement of Disputes (ICSID) case law, which is analysed quantitatively and qualitatively and contextualized alongside interviews with 16 leading arbitrators and lawyers. The article firstly introduces the arbitrator/academic as an agent of international law, and then details the methodology. It then turns to provide an overview of citations to legal scholarship in ICSID case law, before considering why legal actors find it useful. The following parts show how legal scholarship influenced the development of the definition of an ‘investment’ in ICSID arbitration through an analysis of legal decisions and scholarship authored by arbitrators. The final part goes into conversation with the actors to further unravel how they manage competing and complementary obligations towards theory and practice, and the article concludes by reflecting on the ethical implications of their law-making function.",Sociology
1490,,"Decisions made by millions of refugees about where to go, how to make a living and how to secure a future are fundamental drivers of secondary movements. While a substantial body of literature addresses factors contributing to migrants’ decision-making, a comprehensive understanding of the central role of refugees in secondary mobility decision-making, including agency and strategies employed, remains underexplored. This is partly due to the belief that refugees are constrained by external and structural factors and cannot exercise agency, which we challenge. This article provides a systematic analysis of the literature on refugees’ secondary mobility decision-making processes. Using a systematic literature review (SLR) methodology, it presents an in-depth analysis of 40 peer?reviewed, English-language research articles selected from the Web of Science and Scopus databases published before September 2022. The article critically examines the drivers, prevailing dichotomies and conceptual frameworks surrounding refugee categorization, agency, and mobility. By synthesizing a wide range of literature, our paper presents emerging alternative concepts and

countries have decided, or considered, to withdraw from it. Against this backdrop, an emerging
literature has begun to examine attitudes toward the court among the general public as a key
court constituency. However, little is known about how domestic elites perceive the court. This
research gap is particularly surprising given that domestic elites have a considerable impact on
both public and state support of the court. This article explains why political and societal elites
across world regions have confidence or lack confidence in the ICC. We present the results from
a unique survey of 722 elite respondents conducted from 2017 to 2019 across six countries:
Brazil, Germany, the Philippines, Russia, South Africa, and the United States. We furthermore
enrich our analysis by using public opinion data to draw comparisons between elites and the
general public. The analyses reveal that the views of elites are most consistently related to
their perceptions of other, more well-known international organizations and their country’s
relationship with the ICC. Our findings indicate both similarities and differences between how
elite and public opinion about the ICC are formed, demonstrating the value of further research

Using a vignette experiment (N = 384; Observations = 1,102) to manipulate home country conditions, we find that, as expected, the most crucial driver for return intention is the presence of peace in the home country.  Conversely, economic and social conditions commonly outlined in the general migration literature have little to no effect on return intentions of forcibly replaced individuals. However, we also demonstrate that not all forms of peace are equally convincing; a ""punishing"" peace, associated with significant territorial loss, resembles an ongoing state of war and thus discouraging refugees from returning. Similarly, while peace itself does improve return intentions, so does greater integration into the international community. Our paper thus demonstrates that the conditions facilitating return are more nuanced than commonly discussed, and that not all forms of peace are seen as equal.",Sociology
1493,,"Current federalism research is dominated by the successful American model, focusing on a territorialized, mono-national constitutional federalism, where individuals of different nations within a specific territorial scope are jointly subject to and protected by the state. However, this is not the only way federalism can address the coexistence of multiple nations. By reviewing historical figures and theoretical narratives, as well as incorporating contemporary federal theorists on plurality and multiracial coexistence, this study seeks to shed light on a non-territorialized alternative arrangement. Once, facing the complex national coexistence within the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Austrian Marxist Karl Renner proposed the personal principle and cultural autonomy, attempting to reshape the federal structure of the Austro-Hungarian Empire through a non-territorial arrangement. Renner reorganizes national communities as legal entities to act as intermediaries between individuals and the state, and to implement non-territorial economic, political, and cultural management for individuals of their own nations. This study also explores the model's non-territorial character, its treaty-based character, and its embodiment of federalism as norm. In Renner's view, this attempt could achieve a balance, avoiding both the oppression of minorities by the majority within territorial structures and the centrifugal tendencies of minority groups within specific territorial scopes. Although Renner's federalist reforms ultimately failed, they still provide valuable guidance for dealing with the political reality of multinational coexistence today, demonstrating the inherent potential of a non-territorial, pluralistic, treaty-based federalism.",Sociology
1494,,"In recent decades, white fundamentalist Christians became disproportionately affiliated with the Republican Party in the U.S. and some advocate Christian Nationalism. This study examines the association of religious commitment with an index of humanitarian progress and Republican vote percentage in 2012 and 2016 among U.S. states. The percentage of people who say they pray daily in a state strongly correlates with a lower humanitarian progress score and a higher percentage of votes for Trump. The correlations remained strong when other factors (gun ownership, ethnic segregation, and income per cost of living) were controlled statistically in a multiple regression analysis. The results suggest that reliance on the supernatural leads to neglect of the natural. Support of Trump whose dishonesty is legion and who employs the fascist tactic of blaming social problems on minorities seems anomalous with Christian ideology. Although many establishment Republicans warned against Trump, the strong correlation between the Trump vote in 2016 with the vote for the establishment Republican Mitt Romney in 2012 suggests that party members are enmeshed in mutually reinforcing social arrangements that are not conducive to support of humanitarian policies and resistance to fascist tactics.",Sociology
1495,,"Many social media platforms today are driven by content filtering algorithms that personalize their recommendations based on the individual user. Through nuanced interactions with the platform, such as human-algorithm interplay, the end user effortlessly cultivates a social media feed. While this level of personalization can greatly benefit the user, recommended ads and content sometimes resemble aspects of the user's private lives that they may not have wanted the algorithm or platform to know. Moreover, though users show to dislike these experiences of privacy violations, they still engage in disclosure of private information with the system due to fatigue in managing online privacy altogether. This current study integrates Communication Privacy Management (CPM) theory (Petronio, 2002) into the human-algorithm interaction context to examine to what extent social media users (N = 1,305) allow co-ownership of private information with their algorithm depending on their felt privacy fatigue. Results from using latent moderated structural equations (LMS) suggest that individuals’ algorithmic literacy significantly predicts their willingness to allow co-ownership of private information with social media algorithms. Additionally, contrary to previous literature, greater algorithmic awareness leads to less co-ownership for those most fatigued. Considering these findings, implications for future research for human-machine communication privacy management are discussed.",Sociology

We develop a game-theoretic model where an interest group can lobby a politician while learning about their ideological alignment. Our analysis reveals a fundamental tradeoff: interest groups must balance gathering information against exerting immediate influence, while politicians strategically manage their reputations to shape future interactions. These strategic forces generate systematic dynamics: policies and transfers shift in tandem, with early-career politicians showing greater policy variance and extracting larger rents through reputation management than veterans. Uncertainty about alignment increases policy volatility as groups experiment with offers, while institutional features like committee power and revolving-door incentives systematically alter both learning incentives and influence strategies. Our results shed new light on how interest group influence evolves across political careers and varies with institutional context.",Sociology

Fifty-one participants (70.37% female; Mean Age = 24.6) took part in six online focus groups, viewing two randomly selected deepfakes of deceased artists. Thematic analysis, using a phenomenological approach, identified primarily intellectual reactions, with two key layers: first-order evaluations of realism and second-order societal impact assessments. These impacts spanned micro (individuals), meso (content creators/distributors), and macro (society-wide) levels. While cognitive and ethical concerns were prominent, emotional responses were fewer, often expressing discomfort or surprise. Findings offer valuable insights for the digital media industry and regulators in understanding public reception of deepfake technology.",Sociology

Results show that most participants would not share the deepfakes due to a lack of personal relevance. However, those who did intend to share them had hedonistic motivations, mostly enjoyment and the desire to share entertainment with others. The genre of these deepfakes also influenced motivations to share, with political deepfakes being a particularly specific case, and one where gender also had a greater impact. Women avoid sharing inaccurate information to a greater extent and men are more inclined to protect their image in social circles. Overall, this research highlights how audiences dynamically relate to deepfakes and offers insights into the psychological aspects of their relationships with this emerging media form. It also underscores the significance of the perceived entertainment value of deepfakes in their virality.",Sociology

However, little is known about children’s meaning-making of the educators and activists themselves or how the meaning-making is expressed. This qualitative research used thematic analysis to examine 30 storybooks on the environment &amp; climate change authored by 10-15 year olds, to understand the portrayal of characters based on the environmental educators and activists the children had interacted with. Data from interviews, focus group discussions, student reflections and program blogposts were also qualitatively analyzed to confirm understanding from the storybooks. Results show that in 11 of the books, the young authors had introduced protagonists, supporting characters or minor characters inspired by the environmental educators and activists they had interacted with.  These characters were adults who were different from the other adults in the storybooks. They were kind &amp; caring, experts in their field, taught using child-friendly &amp; democratic ways. The characters created a sense of proto-conscientization in the other characters in the books. This proto-conscientization included an understanding of systems of power and oppression which then fuelled political or community based action by the characters in the books. More importantly, the characters were environmental activists from the Global South, a characterization that is missing from eco-fiction or cli-fi.  In this, the young authors contributed to broadening and decolonizing the field of eco-fiction and cli-fi where representations of people from the Global South is often missing or reductive.",Sociology

1505,,"International drug trafficking dominates the conversation on organized crime, but equally common and serious are urban systems of organized crime—criminal groups focused not on exports or transshipment, but on dominating local markets, neighborhoods, and politics. When policymakers do pay attention to this problem, they consistently make the same mistake—believing there are best practices. But systems of organized crime are not all alike. There is no one blueprint or general solution, and so following the latest fad is unlikely to deliver the desired result. Instead of trying to copy the quasi-mythological success of a Giuliani or Bukele, policymakers need to understand what kind of organized crime problem they have, what capabilities their city possesses, and what tools are appropriate to the circumstances. This paper looks in-depth at how organized crime is organized in three cities: Chicago, Medellín, and San Salvador. It also considers New York, Bogotá, and Port-au-Prince. I argue that the primary driver of their organization and incentives is their source of criminal revenues. A second major driver of behavior is the degree of criminal political organization, which broadly-speaking takes three forms: atomized individuals, fragmented groups, and competing confederations. These forms are not just the product of their revenues, but are also the result of decades of competition with the state and one another. What policy tools will work hinges on this diagnosis. I look at the evidence for a range of standard policies—from crackdowns to street outreach—and explain why we can expect them to have wildly different impacts depending on the context.",Sociology

Opportunities include substantial gains in productivity across the research process: notably in data analysis, visualisation, and dissemination. Researchers could thus spend more time focusing on research and less time on administrative or repetitive tasks. Other opportunities include using AI algorithms to analyse the increasing vastness of data obtained in surveys; using AI to improve prediction; and efficiency gains in survey or experimental design/deployment. Challenges include the potential for a vast increase in low-quality publications, especially if academic incentives remain misaligned toward quantity rather than quality of research outputs, as well as the broader existential risks AI may pose.

1508,,"This paper introduces a novel transaction-function model for valuing emerging markets, integrating machine learning, agent-based modeling, and multi-method valuation techniques. Traditional valuation models often rely on aggregated economic indicators such as GDP growth and inflation, which lack the granularity needed to capture the transactional dynamics and unique risk factors inherent to emerging markets. In contrast, the proposed model treats each market as a multi-dimensional function of individual transactions, analyzing these interactions through a multi-method framework that includes Discounted Cash Flow (DCF), comparables, precedent transaction, and multiples analysis. By incorporating machine learning algorithms, the model iteratively improves predictive accuracy, dynamically adjusting to new data in volatile and data-sparse environments. Additionally, agent-based simulations provide insights into behavioral responses to policy changes, regulatory shifts, and other market-specific conditions, offering a behavioral layer often missing from traditional approaches. Validation of this model demonstrates a marked improvement in predictive accuracy and adaptability compared to conventional models. This transaction-function approach provides investors and policymakers with a granular, data-driven tool for assessing the true growth potential of emerging markets, paving the way for more informed, context-sensitive investment decisions.",Sociology

This paper leverages infrastructure studies to discuss the ""infrastructural work of law"" and explore how law’s distributional effects perpetuate injustices in ocean governance. By analyzing case studies such as marine resource conservation and shipping regulations, the study illustrates how thinking of law through an infrastructural lens reveals its agency and its potential for harm in the global ocean polity.

This article examines the relationship between attitudes and ECEC usage at two points in time: 2008 and 2017. The article uses two data, EU-SILC and EVS, and the method multilevel logistic regression. The analysis considers both country-level and individual-level connections, reflecting on ECEC usage. The findings indicate an association between increasingly egalitarian attitudes and rising ECEC participation rates. As attitudes among less educated individuals change more slowly, their impact on ECEC usage could become more significant, particularly concerning inequality in ECEC usage. This is evident in the cross-level interaction between overall attitudes and mothers’ education in predicting ECEC participation among children under three years old. The disparity in ECEC usage between the less educated and those with higher levels of education is growing.",Sociology

These challenges are particularly prevalent for female migrants. Studies on free movement within

from the perspective of ECOWAS officials. Mobility infrastructures are conceptualised as comprising 
legal, physical, and technological components that collectively facilitate or restrict movement. The 
analysis draws on documentary evidence and insights from 19 semi-structured interviews with 
ECOWAS Commission officials. It shows that access to mobility infrastructures is predominantly 
determined by embedded gender norms, laws, and practices. By analysing accounts from officials 
involved in constructing the free movement regime, the article provides unique insights into the 
disparities between institutional intentions, legal frameworks, and mobility trajectories. In doing so,

1521,,"Although the organisational aspects of scholarly journals—such as the types of organisations responsible for publishing individual journals, whether independently or in collaboration—have significant implications for scholarly communication, they have received little focused research attention on a large scale. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of all WoS-indexed journals (N=21,886), focusing on the type of organisations that are officially attached to publishing the journals, either alone or together. We also investigate the disciplinary, geographical and linguistic diversity, and the key bibliometric characteristics, of journals (co)published by different types of organisations. By augmenting WoS metadata with a custom classification concerning organisational information about the journals publishing and governing organisations available through the International ISSN Centre, this study provides a larger and more detailed analysis than has been available so far. Our results show that 66% of journals are published by a sole organisation type (professional, research organisation, society), and 34% respectively are published through combinations of these different organisation types. The most common form of collaboration was a professional publisher with a scholarly society as the collaborative organisation.",Sociology
1522,,"Our starting point is to challenge the often-made assumption that large cities are so complex that they have become ungovernable or that globalization pressures make political and policy choices irrelevant. By going beyond rational or positivist views of governance, it argues that the process of governing a city is never fully complete, nor linear. The paper refers to a systematic review of the academic literature. Urban societies are more or less governed and that may change from one city to the next, from one period to the next. Processes of government and governance are always work in progress, but make crucial differences over time. Case studies show that modes of governance have long-term consequences for their inhabitants and governing failures may have severe negative effects (e.g. housing shortages, low levels of educational attainment, crime, low productivity, health). The systematic analysis of the literature shows the need to describe and document at the same time (1) how processes of governance operate in relation to major urban development projects, the implementation of public policies and (2) the implications of such practices for inequalities; so to say articulating an analysis of the governance processes and their outcomes. The paper suggests that the link between metropolitan governance and inequalities allow considering inequalities not only as the outcomes of policy choices, but also as part of the way in which metropolitan policies are implemented.",Sociology
1523,,"The video game market is forecasted to be valued at $321.6 billion by 2027. Today, younger generations increasingly prefer spending their leisurely time playing online video games. Beyond providing a leisurely – and often competitive – activity to the bulk of its user base, online video games provide cybercriminals with an environment that is free from the reigns of legal enforcement. More specifically, with the growing popularity and uptake of the microtransaction business model, money launderers are provided with novel channels to move their illicitly gained funds. A continuously expanding body of evidence underscores that money laundering is occurring through online video games. Foremost, cybercriminals are attracted to the anonymity and global reach offered by online video games with few to no controls currently in place to disrupt laundering processes. Furthermore, regulations are struggling to keep pace with the latest money laundering strategies employed by cybercriminals. This paper explores and discusses money laundering in the context of online video games. Core vulnerabilities enabling money laundering to occur through online video games are identified. Security controls to reduce the scale of laundering are proposed.",Sociology
1524,,"Do voters ``signal'' their decisions by voting early, or do they ``snipe'' by casting their votes at the last minute?  In transparent sequential roll call voting, such as in the U.S. House of Representatives, voters can strategically choose when to cast their votes. This contrasts with the U.S. Senate's sequential voting, where the order is exogenously determined, or private simultaneous voting, as typically seen in elections. Despite the significance of these roll call votes in high-stakes decision-making, the potential for strategic behavior based on vote timing remains underexplored. This paper examines the causal effect of transparent sequential voting on voter decision timing, leveraging a natural experiment from roll call votes in a crypto startup (DAO), which transitioned from private one-stage voting to transparent sequential voting. I collected a dataset of individual-level voting records, delegated voting power, and precise vote timing. First, the fixed-effect regression analysis reveals that introducing a public tally in transparent sequential voting increases the likelihood of early voting (signaling) or last-minute voting (sniping) compared to the baseline of private simultaneous voting. This finding is consistent with game-theoretic predictions. Additionally, interaction models show that more pivotal voters, measured by the Shapley-Shubik index, are more likely to vote early rather than snipe at the last minute. These results suggest that a public tally may adversely affect welfare regarding information aggregation, as signaling strategies can intensify the influence of pivotal voters.",Sociology
1525,,"This paper investigates the impact of trade liberalization on structural transformation, using quasi-experimental tariff reductions from Brazil's 1990s reforms. Building on recent cross-regional macroeconomic literature, we extend the traditional shift-share framework to estimate both local and spatial spillover effects on sectoral employment shares, providing insights on aggregate outcomes. Regions more exposed to tariff cuts saw declines in manufacturing employment, increases in the primary sector, and reductions in non-tradables. Spillover effects—mediated through migration or proximity—partially offset local deindustrialization in manufacturing but amplified declines in non-tradables. These effects persisted for over twenty years and proved robust to alternative explanations, including competing structural transformation hypotheses and other economic shocks during the period of analysis. Overall, our findings support theories highlighting comparative advantage as a potential driver of trade-induced structural transformation.",Sociology
1526,,"Since 2022, central bank losses have been prevalent in advanced economies due to previous quantitative easing and recent inflationary pressures. This paper focuses on the unique case of the United Kingdom, where the government promised in advance to cover any central bank losses arising from quantitative easing. This promise is known as the indemnity. A game-theoretical model is proposed to explain the causes and effects of such indemnity. The model's predictions about the indemnity's effect on central bank profitability are empirically examined. Using the novel Dynamic Multilevel Latent Factor Model (DM-LFM), the indemnity is found to have significantly boosted the Bank of England's profits in the deflationary environment after 2008, but exacerbated its losses under the recent inflationary pressure since 2022. The theoretical model suggests the pronounced effects are due to the Bank of England's high sensitivity to losses and the UK government's moderate fiscal liberalism. Therefore, the British experience should not be generalised. Nevertheless, the theoretical and empirical lessons can inform policy-makers about future institutional designs concerning the fiscal-monetary interactions and the public finance-price stability trade-off.",Sociology
1527,,"The traditional framework of fertility research conceptualizes childbirth from the mother's perspective. From her perspective, birth is an uncertain and potentially recurring event. In contrast, the Born once, die once (B1D1) framework conceptualizes birth as an event experienced by the child. From its perspective, birth is certain and, like death, occurs only once. As an advantage over the traditional approach, the child's perspective allows for the use of density, survival, and hazard functions to study fertility age patterns at the macro level using birth counts for all parities by maternal age. Here, we reformulate the B1D1 framework using fertility rate notation and extend the traditional fertility framework by analogous density, survival, and hazard functions. We compare this extended traditional framework with the B1D1 framework using data on Swedish cohorts born in the 19th and 20th centuries. Large historical differences between the density, survival, and hazard functions in the two frameworks have diminished for more recent cohorts, suggesting converging conclusions about fertility age patterns. The new density, survival, and hazard functions can shed new light on differences in fertility age patterns across populations and advance traditional fertility research, including by capturing fertility and mortality age patterns with common concepts and measures.",Sociology

Donors, including bilateral and multilateral agencies, respond variably; bilateral aid often decreases following anti-NGO laws, while multilateral aid remains stable. Private donors' responses depend on factors like social trust and NGO transparency. NGOs adapt by diversifying funding, forming affiliates, or shifting to community-based support. As the space for civil society continues to shrink, coordinated international efforts are essential to counteract these repressive trends and uphold civil society's role in democratic governance.",Sociology
1529,,"The predominance of catastrophic and dystopian visions about the future makes it difficult to envision and articulate pathways for sustainability transformations towards more positive futures. To address this challenge, the ""Seeds of a Good Anthropocene” (SoGA) project began over a decade ago, in 2014. The project seeks to identify and amplify existing, innovative, non-mainstream sustainability initiatives, which we call “seeds”, that have the potential to contribute to new development pathways and create positive futures. These “seeds” offer tangible examples of how positive change is already happening out of the mainstream, and imagining how they could grow provides a useful way of describing different plausible, desirable futures and articulating pathways to move towards those futures. This paper reviews the history of the SoGA project, its theoretical underpinnings, and its ongoing impact on futures thinking, scenario development, and sustainability science. Combining personal reflections of the project's founders with a bibliometric analysis of over 30 peer-reviewed papers connected to the SoGA project, the paper identifies key people, places, and ideas that have contributed to the project. It also highlights the project’s diverse activities, such as a mobile app to identify urban ‘seeds’ and assisting in the development of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) Nature Futures Framework. The paper concludes by suggesting future research directions for the next decade of the SoGA project.",Sociology

King County, Washington, twelfth largest U.S. county, hosts the third largest homeless population, many of whom reside in Seattle. Discouraging encampments and providing shelter beds has proven ineffective. We investigate how street survivors make encampment choices based on amenities proximity compared to those in shelters and rental units. We analyze rich spatial, administrative, and outreach worker data from Seattle’s Evergreen Treatment Services (REACH) on people living unsheltered (from 2016 to 2022). We discuss the implications of providing effective support for people living unhoused, and provide what is — to our knowledge — the most comprehensive and recent study of neighborhood access and proximity to amenities among the unsheltered population in Seattle, WA. We find that encampment locations more closely reflected the access of renting, housed populations across all amenities in the majority of neighborhoods., and that some amenities provide an opportunity for personal agency with regard to basic needs, particularly food-related amenities (with the exception of food banks), were closer to encampments than shelters. We conclude that housing options that feel like homes rather than institutions are critical to support the unhoused. In the interim, shelters should be more integrated into neighborhoods, and better reflect tent encampment and rental trends. Policymakers and practitioners must provide effective support that centers on autonomy, dignity, and harm reduction for those who survive outside.",Sociology
1531,,"This research employs the Alkire-Foster approach to measure multidimensional poverty between 2012 and 2020 in China, followed by examining the role of the three-pillar pension system in mitigating household multidimensional poverty. With the China Family Panel Studies data, our measurement uncovers the sustainable effects and mechanisms of household participation in the multi-pillar pension system on poverty mitigation. The results indicate that more participation in the pension system mitigates the probability of being trapped in multidimensional poverty. The findings reveal the significance of state social insurance, enterprise annuity, and individual commercial insurance. The mitigation effect of market-oriented pillars is achieved through more investment in and consumption for livelihood assets. Based upon the sustainable livelihoods framework, livelihood assets ameliorate household capabilities in human, natural, financial, and psychological capital against risks, shocks, and uncertainties. Our research contributes to the knowledge of how household participation in pension pillars sustainably mitigates multidimensional poverty through micro-level mechanisms and to the policy praxis of why a facilitating state is called for poverty mitigation from the perspective of new structural economics.",Sociology

We examine the diffusion of an effective IPV prevention intervention beyond direct participants with 1181 married adult participants in Nepal’s Gandaki province. Study timepoints included pre-intervention, mid-intervention, post-intervention, and six months post-intervention. Cluster-adjusted regressions assessed change in IPV, social norms, and secondary outcomes for two intervention conditions (intervention participants; intervention community residents (community)) relative to adjacent control community residents. Intervention and community women's reported IPV decreased 26.8% and 20.5% respectively six-months post-intervention, with significant improvements in descriptive norms, gender equitable attitudes, relationship quality, and communication (for both intervention groups) and injunctive norms, leadership, and anti-violence advocacy (for intervention participants). Intervention and community men’s norms did not improve relative to control; however, both intervention groups reported improved anti-violence advocacy. Intervention men also improved in communication and help-providing to survivors. Change, an intervention intentionally designed for diffusion, may be effective at reducing IPV, improving associated norms, and extending programming benefits beyond those intentionally targeted.",Sociology

This project finds no evidence of a realignment with the Mao era in the party communiques or government reports under Xi Jinping. Instead, the reports under Xi Jinping are found to be more similar to those under his immediate predecessors. However, this project documents a divergence in the style of the party communiques and government reports under Xi Jinping, with the former becoming more abstract and ideological, and the latter becoming more concrete and policy-oriented. One source of this divergence is the downplaying of the five-year plans in the party communiques and government reports, which used to be the one of the overlapping themes of both documents.",Sociology
1534,,"Patterns of volunteering have predominantly been explained by focusing on the supply side of volunteering, where differences in volunteering reflect differences in resources and motivations. In this article, we shift the focus to the demand side of volunteering, and argue that a proper account of differences in volunteering must include differences in demand for help. We develop the concept of demand networks, as the inverse of support networks, and argue that demand networks are important to explain voluntary social work and support. We define demand networks as the demand for support requested through ego’s personal network. We propose a model where the amount of demand for help in ego’s network influences the likelihood that ego helps. We then turn to explain what factors create differences in amount of demand in personal networks as well as how they mediate and moderate the effect of demand networks. We focus on factors at 1) a structural level concerning the socio-economic strata of the individual and the organization of the voluntary effort, distinguishing between informal- and formal civil society, and 2) at an institutional level focusing on altruistic values and gendered social roles that may differentiate expectations to care for others and respond to demands for help. We test the resulting associational hypotheses using a cross-sectional population survey inquiring about volunteering during COVID-19 in Denmark. The results support the main hypotheses, indicating the importance of the demand side to adequately explain volunteering.",Sociology

1536,,"Australia’s newly established wellbeing framework, ‘Measuring What Matters’ (MWM), seeks to measure social progress and influence policy by reporting on 50 wellbeing indicators within five “themes”.  In this paper, we assess whether the MWM framework adequately measures what people in Australia value for their wellbeing by examining both the process of the framework’s development and its content. Firstly, we consider whether the consultation process undertaken was adequate. Secondly, we examine whether the MWM indicators align with existing research on what people in Australia value for their wellbeing. We identified limitations across all four aspects of the consultation examined: its comprehensiveness, reach, transparency, and extent to which it genuinely incorporated community feedback into the framework. While the MWM framework was found to broadly align with existing research on what Australians value for their wellbeing, there were some notable divergences. We urge the Australian Government to undertake a comprehensive, wide-reaching, transparent, and genuine consultation across Australia. Furthermore, we recommend that the Australian Government develop new indicators in consultation with the public. Enhancing the MWM framework will help establish it as a cornerstone of government decision-making, and importantly, ensure that it does what it purports to do: measure what Australians value for their wellbeing.",Sociology
1537,,"This report investigates the feasibility of developing a holistic indicator to assess and communicate the social sustainability and quality of life in Vancouver. Despite the availability of various specific metrics, there is a noted absence of a comprehensive framework that integrates these metrics to
provide a singular, actionable view of the city's progress towards its social
sustainability goals.
The City of Vancouver currently employs 45 population-level indicators under its Healthy City Strategy, demonstrating the city's commitment to transparent and data-driven governance. However, these indicators, while effective individually, do not collectively provide a complete picture of the city's overall
health across various dimensions such as public health, housing, education, and environmental sustainability.
The aim of this research was to identify a holistic indicator that encompasses multiple dimensions of social sustainability to simplify assessments and improve strategic planning. 
Through a desktop review of 70 existing indicators and consultations with experts, two models were identified as particularly promising: the Greater London Authority's (GLA) Wellbeing and Sustainability Measure, and the City of Calgary's Equity Index (CEI). These models offer robust frameworks that prioritize equity, accessibility, and stakeholder involvement, aligning closely with Vancouver's urban development goals.
This work highlights the need for an overarching metric that reflects the interdependencies among various domains, ensuring that progress in one area does not undermine another. By leveraging insights from this research, Vancouver can enhance its policy implementation and community engagement, moving closer to achieving a balanced and sustainable urban environment. The proposed holistic indicator will also support the city in benchmarking against other urban centers and refining its
strategic initiatives based on quantifiable metrics.",Sociology

1541,,"This paper examines the rapid growth of China’s science and technology (S&amp;T) sector within the broader context of higher education, focusing on the often-overlooked role of Hong Kong in this transformation. While conventional explanations emphasize China’s relationship with the United States, this study argues that Hong Kong has played a crucial, yet underappreciated, role in advancing China’s higher education and S&amp;T capabilities. Despite its reputation as a finance-driven city, Hong Kong has developed a robust academic and scientific community that fostered close collaborations with mainland institutions. In the 1990s, as Hong Kong’s research doctoral programs were gaining momentum, mainland students sought high-quality advanced training, and members of the overseas Chinese academic diaspora returned to join Hong Kong universities. This cross-border collaboration thrived despite cultural and ideological differences, combining the mainland’s motivated talent pool with Hong Kong’s free academic environment. Using a comprehensive dataset from the Web of Science, institutional archives, university leader biographies, and PhD dissertation records from Hong Kong’s top universities, this paper provides both quantitative and qualitative analyses of the historical collaboration between Hong Kong and mainland China. The findings reveal that this relationship was evolutionary, initiated by forward-thinking educators long before formal mechanisms were in place, and was instrumental in China’s rise to global prominence in higher education and S&amp;T. By revisiting this underexplored dimension of China’s educational development, this paper offers a new understanding of the forces behind the country’s remarkable achievements in higher education and scientific research.",Sociology
1542,,"This study proposed a strategy for causal identification in survey experiments by leveraging heteroscedasticity induced through information provision (Z). Here, Z affects attitudes (D), which in turn influences behavior (Y). While Z might traditionally serve as an instrumental variable (IV), a direct effect from Z to the outcome variable (Y) would invalidate it as an IV due to exclusion restriction violations. Building on prior methods, such as Lewbel’s IV approach, which utilize naturally occurring heteroscedasticity in observational data, this study explored the artificial induction of heteroscedasticity within survey experiments. 

We developed a new unbiased estimator within linear structural model and conducted simulations to confirm that this new estimator outperforms conventional IV estimators. We further addressed the issue of endogenous non-compliance, and discussed that under the homogeneous function assumption, manipulating information ambiguity can yield a consistent bias-corrected estimator. This approach can enhance the possibility of causal identification by survey experiments and extend heteroscedasticity-based methodologies to complex compliance contexts, offering new tools for robust experimental design.",Sociology

LLMs represent a promising avenue for addressing this gap by offering culturally competent, conversational interfaces capable of supporting cognitive function. Despite current limitations in context retention and response accuracy, advancements in LLM technology could enhance personalization and continuity of care, potentially transforming LLMs into significant companions for older adults experiencing cognitive decline. This paper provides an overview of existing LLM capabilities, the challenges that remain, and a projection of how these models might evolve to meet the growing needs of an aging society.",Sociology

I offer the situational scoping method as an approach that applies rigorous and transparent methods to conduct an overview of large databases of industry documents by focusing on specific empirical “situations” as the object of study. It is conducted by a collective of transdisciplinary researchers and community members who shape knowledge production based on their unique experience and opinions about which situations are deemed essential for emancipatory action. The situational scoping method is rooted in a critical constructivist epistemology and consists of three stages: 1) identification of a broad range of external events over time perceived by industries as a threat or opportunity to business interests; 2) selection of a sample of external events for further analysis; and 3) social worlds/arenas mapping of industry responses to selected external events. I describe the epistemological and methodological influences, development, and procedures of the situational scoping method drawing from my experience conducting a pilot study with a project team engaged in scoping of documents related to environmental exposures and breast cancer in the University of California, San Francisco Industry Documents Library, which houses millions of documents produced by the tobacco, opioids, chemical, drug, food, and fossil fuel industries.

Gli autori analizzano le condizioni sociali e sanitarie dei “villaggi” durante i primi giorni di quarantena, evidenziando come l’isolamento abbia esacerbato l’accesso limitato ai servizi essenziali e peggiorato le condizioni economiche e di vita di queste popolazioni già vulnerabili.

Utilizzando una metodologia innovativa di interviste telefoniche, resa possibile grazie a un rapporto di fiducia con i residenti, l’Associazione 21 luglio ha raccolto dati preziosi sui problemi quotidiani e sulle misure di auto-tutela adottate dai residenti. L’articolo rivela le gravi carenze nei servizi di base, come l’accesso all’acqua potabile, i dispositivi di protezione e le risorse alimentari, che non solo aggravano le difficoltà materiali ma intensificano anche la segregazione e la marginalità sociale.

Le evidenze raccolte spingono a ripensare le politiche pubbliche di emergenza, promuovendo misure che includano la distribuzione di beni di prima necessità e il supporto educativo, soprattutto per i bambini in età scolare privati della didattica a distanza. Gli autori propongono azioni collaborative e incrementali, come programmi di assistenza alimentare per i bambini da 0 a 3 anni, e sottolineano la necessità di contrastare lo stigma e il razzismo nei confronti delle comunità Rom per costruire legami solidali e interdipendenti con la società circostante.

This paper calls for urgent sociological intervention, advocating for a reframing of imposter participation as not just a methodological concern but as a critical issue in debates about epistemology, exclusion, and inclusivity in research practices.

Teaching Innovation Grants maintain overall course quality (4.08 vs 4.12) while enabling substantial changes, with specific innovations rated highly (3.94/5). The curriculum game achieves high satisfaction (3.87/5) across several dimensions and the Student Research Platform shows strong engagement through both usage patterns and evaluations (3.92/5).

1549,,"Current prominent music evolution theories suggest music evolved as a participatory group activity, whose adaptive functions were strengthening and/or signaling social cohesion. However, the prevalence of collective music-making varies substantially across societies, and in some cases is exceptionally rare. Here, we consider hypotheses for three factors which could attenuate collective music-making: diminished collective action more generally, an emphasis on musical expertise, and solo-oriented musical styles. We look at data related to these hypotheses in four societies in which collective music-making is rare: the Tsimane of lowland Bolivia, the Ache of eastern Paraguay, the Ayoreo of Bolivia and Paraguay, and the Tuvans of the Russian Republic of Tyva. Our results suggest that the scale and religiosity of collective action is the most important factor related to the overall degree of collective music-making in a culture. The effect of musical expertise was mostly limited to the dominance of shamans in religious contexts, while well-developed solo musical styles did not necessarily prevent group performance in other social settings. We also note the importance of cultural loss due to influence of invading colonial and imperial forces in diminishing indigenous forms of collective music-making. Notably, in all the cases we consider, episodes of some form of collective music-making do (or historically did) occur during important social events, a fact which supports the group-functionalist view. Our findings also point to the centrality and ubiquity of the religious function of music, and suggest this aspect of musical behavior needs to be better addressed by evolutionary theories of music.",Sociology
1550,,"This article analyses the (post)colonial politics of UK bordering through the lens of monstrosity. Historicising contemporary bordering within colonial-era monsterisations of racialised people and their mobility, we identify four mechanisms through which migrants are constructed and policed as monsters today: animalisation, zombification, criminalisation and barbarisation. We then examine how the state embodies monstrosity itself through border policies of deterrence and creating ‘hostile environments’. In addition to the instrumentalization of horror, this entails extending the border’s reach domestically throughout everyday life and internationally through deportation and externalisation measures. We argue these developments embody a new form of state power, depicted as a headless tentacled Leviathan. Doing so provides insights into monstrosity as a form of liberal statecraft, the local/global diffusion of bordering, the transnationalisation of sovereign power, and the racialisation of citizenship. It also raises important questions about the construction of border violence as a necessary and legitimate monstrosity in (post)colonial liberal societies, the everyday complicity of citizens, and the limits of efforts to humanise monsterised migrants or reform monstrous state institutions. Revealing how within liberal regimes of citizenship and humanitarianism values ‘there be monsters’, we argue, opens space for thinking about abolitionist alternatives in international politics.",Sociology

According to this model, Kamala Harris is projected to win the popular vote with 52.5% of the two-party vote share, approximately 1.5-2 points higher than most other forecasts and polling averages. I then calculate each state’s deviation from the national vote share (its relative Democratic or Republican lean) based on recent high-quality polling, adding these deviations to the Economy-Quality Model’s national prediction to derive state-level predictions and electoral college results. The model forecasts Kamala Harris winning the electoral college with 319 votes.",Sociology

We suggest a “narrative theory of alienation” that builds on a renewed interest in alienation to sharpen both concepts, developing the concept of “structural narratives” as “anchors” (Swidler 2001b) for ongoing “active narratives” and actors’ “biographical narratives” about themselves. We distinguish between these three narrative categories, showing how structural narratives situate the temporality and parameters of alienation, thereby providing clarity to some of alienation’s ongoing conceptual problems. In so doing, the authors show how “structural narratives” can provide a theoretical resource to the broader study of narratives and culture. The authors further their argument by referencing various works of literature and social scientific research throughout the text, ending with a more thorough examination of alienation in schools.",Sociology
1554,,"This report describes how immigration advocates—people engaging in political or legal campaigns for, and/or offering direct services and support to, immigrants—understand their efforts to reduce or prevent the harms of the U.S. immigration system on immigrants and their families. We draw on interviews with 67 immigration advocates representing 76 immigrant-serving nonprofits across the United States between November 2021 and February 2023. The interviews affirm advocates and their organizations’ important frontline roles in reducing systemic harm by addressing immigrants’ immediate material, social, and/or legal needs. Yet, when it comes to preventing harm by reforming or transforming the immigration system, many advocates believe their efforts do little but maintain the system’s structure. Advocates attribute this dynamic to several sources, including the ever-evolving harms of the current system; the demands of the public and private funders their organizations rely on; intraorganizational challenges common to immigrant-serving organizations; and the perceived immovability of the national, state, and local political contexts they work in. We conclude with several immediate and long-range suggestions for immigration advocates to consider as they continue their work.",Sociology

1557,,"Purpose — This paper aims to investigate how best to classify money laundering through online video games (i.e. virtual laundering). Currently, there is no taxonomy available for scholars and practitioners to refer to when discussing money laundering through online video games. Without a well-defined taxonomy it becomes difficult to reason through, formulate and implement effective regulatory measures, policies and security controls. As such, efforts to prevent and reduce virtual laundering incidence rates are hampered.
Design/methodology/approach — This paper proposes three mutually exclusive virtual laundering
categorizations. However, instead of fixating on the processes undergirding individual instances of virtual laundering, it is argued that focusing on the initial locale of the illicit proceeds provides the appropriate framing within which to classify instances of virtual laundering. Thus, the act of classification becomes an ontological endeavor, rather than an attempt at elucidating an inherently varied process (as is common of the placement, layering and integration model).

Secondly, which areas have been treated with a greater degree of ideological bias and would therefore benefit from a more critical realist approach (Pratschke, 2003)? Thirdly, what insights have been gained? In responding to these queries, the chapter considers the ways in which research has frequently examined associationism with a view to elucidating broader dynamics, including those pertaining to politics, professionalisation, organisation, community, elites, cooperation, and categories of stratification. As we examine the ways in which cities engage with associations, we observe a multiplicity of modes of governance, a diversity of instruments of public action, and a structure of associational opportunities. This allows us to investigate the mechanisms and processes involved, adopting a historical and comparative approach that aligns with Weberian principles.",Sociology

The study analyzes a four-year project (2020-2024) aimed at developing responsive curricula across 17 bachelor and master programmes. A survey of 64 staff members involved in the project revealed notable changes in curriculum content, focusing on sustainability, data science, and professional skills. Teaching methods shifted towards active learning, blended learning, and creating an inclusive learning environment. The project positively impacted programme quality, organizational culture, and knowledge sharing, with three-quarters of respondents perceiving increase organisational readiness to respond to societal development and improve courses and programmes. Key tools for curriculum development included teaching innovation grants and discretionary programme-level budgets. These findings offer valuable insights for higher education institutions seeking to implement responsive curricula and navigate the complexities of organizational change in academic settings.",Sociology

Despite extensive research on gaming behavior in urban settings, there is a notable gap in understanding these dynamics in rural areas. This study aims to fill that gap by exploring the extent and nature of toxic behaviors and the use of offensive language among rural adolescents playing online games in Baybay City, Leyte. Through Symbolic Interactionism, this study aimed to identify the underlying factors contributing to such behaviors and their potential impacts on communication and social development. This study conducted a series of interviews, focus group discussions, and community observation to supplement the initial survey. Results showed that adolescents in rural areas are aware of their toxic behavior, but due to its normalization, do not think of it as a problem and instead see it as part of online gaming culture. This suggests the need to strengthen proper communication and improve maturity among players engaging in online games that require them to socialize.",Sociology
1561,,"The idea that labor scarcity can induce economic development has long been hypothesized (Hicks, 1932; Habakkuk, 1962), but the evidence remains limited. This paper examines how the Second Great Migration (1940–1970) spurred structural change in the American South between 1970 and 2010. Empirical results using shift-share instruments show that out-migration incentivized capital investment and capital-augmenting technical change, increasing capital per worker and output in both agriculture and manufacturing, at least until 2010. Labor was reallocated from agriculture to non-agriculture. I then develop a dynamic spatial equilibrium model that allows for substitution between factors of production, factor-biased technical change, and factor abundance-based trade to characterize this process. The quantitative analysis indicates that labor-capital substitution played a major role in adjustments to South-to-North migration.",Sociology
1562,,"Carbon taxation is widely embraced as an effective tool for reducing emissions, yet it is economically regressive, disproportionately affecting economically vulnerable groups. Hence, it is no surprise that carbon taxes often are perceived as unfair, and if implemented without consideration of distributive effects, they risk generating polarization and climate policy setbacks, as well as increasing existing inequalities. We provide the first causal analysis of how and to what extent existing social protection programs could be used to reduce opposition to carbon taxes. We employ a conjoint experiment targeting 5,188 respondents from Sweden to assess the causal effect of increased generosity in pensions, sickness insurance, unemployment insurance, and child benefits, benchmarked against the effect of monthly monetary handouts. Our findings suggest that increasing benefit generosity within each of the four examined social protection programs reduces opposition to carbon taxation. Most importantly, increased old age pension generosity have a substantial and significant impact across various demographic groups, regardless of the respondents’ political affiliation. This effect is more potent than other compensatory measures, a critical insight in the search for socially acceptable climate policy strategies that avoid increasing inequalities.",Sociology

Formal teaching about climate change is fragmented across subjects, and limited to explanations of the scientific mechanisms, ignoring the entire socio-economic, historical and political context that led to and perpetuates the phenomenon. This empirical research explores the outcomes from the Young Climate Authors, a holistic climate justice intervention where middle &amp; high schoolers wrote storybooks on climate change. The program was implemented with a cohort of 18 10-15 year olds in Chennai, India in 2023.

Results reveal that the YCA had a transformative decolonizing impact by created a sense of proto-conscientization based on deepened place-ecological meaning. The participants’ understanding of climate change shifted from vague, ‘textbook’ish knowledge to a nuanced and holistic understanding impacting Chennai, its marginalized communities and the more-than-human. Emotion was deeply intertwined in this understanding where a sense of empathy and anger, that the learning had engendered, shaped the storybooks that were written. The scientific understanding of climate change also improved. The results highlight the importance of using critical and constructivist pedagogy for climate change education which shape place-based and decolonized student ideas about climate change.",Sociology

However, population forecasts are often produced at coarse scales, namely national and regional, and state of the art small area forecasting methods are scarce and adjusted to work on Global North countries. We aim to explore the accuracy of autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models to forecast population totals and age-group populations at the intraurban level for the municipalities of Greater Mexico City. We use WorldPop 2000-10 population estimates as input data and perform retrospective forecasts for 2011-20. Comparing our forecasts with actual population counts, we found that ARIMA models return a median error of 1.5% when forecasting population totals in a 10-year horizon, and 5.7% for population forecasts by age-group. The age-groups 0-14, 15-39 and 40-64 performed particularly well, with error levels below 5% in most municipalities, while the age-group 65+ displays higher errors, typically over 20%. We conclude that ARIMA models outperform accuracy levels of small area population forecasts from previous studies which use different methods across the Global North. Yet, ARIMA models have limitations. They are powerful when rates of population change are linear or unchanged but cannot predict sudden changes in demographic components or ageing processes in cohorts with different population size.",Sociology

Among climate adaptation technologies, the development of new wind energy infrastructure is widely supported in the United States. Yet, the siting of wind farms is often contentious. This research problematizes how local stakeholders frame their opposition to offshore wind projects at a time when the swift adoption of renewable energies is generally seen as a necessity for environmental, social, and economic reasons. Through qualitative content analysis of 89 public comments pertaining to offshore wind projects planned for the North Carolina coast, we argue that objections to wind projects reflect an understanding of the infrastructure’s environmental burden and, importantly, a desire to protect environmental privilege. Findings suggest a need for expanded research on the dimensions of privilege that may be at play across wind farm sites and that any consideration of a just transition must consider how expressions of privilege inform environmental political discourse and siting decisions.",Sociology

This change is grounded in studies indicating that area-based rainfall metrics can more accurately predict flood risk, especially in flash-flood-prone regions. Studies have shown that traditional depth measurements do not adequately reflect runoff potential, while volume-over-area metrics better represent the hydrological impact on various landscapes (Peleg et al., 2017). A proposed rainfall intensity scale, modeled after hurricane categorization systems, aims to improve communication of rainfall severity and promote preparedness.

This article discusses the immigrant-native gap regarding the risk of overeducation for 28 European countries on the basis of the EU-LFS 2021 ad hoc module. Immigrants’ higher overeducation risks are interpreted as the result of processes of legal closure as well as statistical and taste-based discrimination. Higher overeducation rates of third country nationals (TCN) in contrast to EU migrants indicate that EU citizenship reduces discrimination and facilitates the recognition of educational certificates – they are skill-preserving devices for EU citizens but not for TCN. The large overeducation rates in particular in Southern Europe can be explained by segmented labour markets with higher unemployment and lower skill requirements increase overeducation risks, in particular for TCN. Moreover, it can be shown that EU citizenship, a higher educational level of the population, and more inclusive labour markets facilitate the occupational integration of immigrants.",Sociology

Our methods are twofold: 1) we assess whether university staff use the personal statement in ways that align with information on student-facing websites, and 2) we perform an in-depth transparency analysis of fifteen university course websites to assess the extent to which universities helped applicants to understand what a high-quality personal statement looked like. We find considerable evidence of issues related to transparency, with some examples of good practice. The paper concludes with several recommendations for providers to enhance their transparency.

The paper shows how the chatbot hype is driven by a dynamic between privileged actors (hypers) and a media frenzy both influencing and being carried by society and politics alike. Different interdependent building blocks in the chatbot hype construction are identified: 1. Depicting LLMs chatbots as knowledge models, 2. Entertaining the uncanny and manipulative side of chatbots, 3. Staging a spectacle of competition between tech giants, and 4. Praising the dualism of doomsday apocalypse or a tech-religious calling for a promised future.

Results show that ideations and intentions about the transition to adulthood –just like actual behaviours– are gendered and display remarkable country differences. The heterogeneity in the timing of intentions hints that key events, such as cohabitation, are not uniformly pervasive in young adults' lives. Also, a gap exists between ideal and actual ages at which events are experienced, particularly among men who are less likely to experience events at their “ideal” time compared to women. The extent to which intentions and ideations regarding the transition to adulthood translate into actual behaviours varies across countries and gender.",Sociology

Wage decompositions indicate that, between 2006 and 2019, essential workers earned less compared to other workers within higher-paid strata, while they earned more within lower-paid strata of the occupational structure in the Netherlands. These wage differentials are shaped by sex composition and sectoral employment. In addition, I employ a difference-in-differences design based on quarterly data between 2017 and 2022 to assess whether the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic reduced an existing average wage gap in response to an increasing public appreciation of essential work.

According to this perspective, the policy solution is straight forward: provide gatekeepers with accurate individual-level information and discrimination will cease. Grades are important signals to students about academic ability and influence future educational choices. Previous studies find that teachers exhibit negative grading bias against boys, racialized minority students, and low-SES students so these groups receive signals about lower academic potential than merited. In this study, we test whether grading bias stems from statistical discrimination. First, we leverage a natural experiment in which teachers were given information from standardized tests and see whether this change mitigates grading bias. We further test this mechanism by analyzing the role of the performance of a given social background group at the same school the year prior. We find substantial grading bias but conclude that statistical discrimination is not likely to play a major role.",Sociology

This article examines the multifaceted ways in which citizenship operates as an organizing principle within the complex of rules and norms governing transnational human mobility, including how the increasing acceptance of dual nationality status and the emergence of citizenship-by-investment schemes reverberate throughout the legal infrastructure and create new pathways for elite mobility. Using citizenship as an exploratory lens, the article thereby seeks to theoretically complement and nuance existing scholarship in migration and mobility studies, arguing that physical space remains the dominant structure for human mobility. As we show, legal infrastructures reconfigure access to human mobility in ways that simultaneously fragment and compress physical space as it pertains to transnational movement.",Sociology

Consequently, there is a shortfall in the state's legal frameworks adequately protecting consumer freedom and property rights. In response, the Bitcoin network has emerged as a private currency governed by a distinct legal framework rooted in proof-of-work. Consumers holding Bitcoin benefit from the economic advantages of global deflation-advantages often usurped by central banks-and experience enhanced freedom to delay consumption, navigating their life paths free from the constraints of social engineering. Thus, Bitcoin contributes value by addressing the shortfall in state legal systems that safeguard consumer freedom and property rights",Sociology
1577,,"Styles of traditional decorative art vary substantially across cultures. While early theorists attributed this variation to differences in environment, scholarship has long focused on decorative artworks as vehicles of social information and stylistic variation as a consequence of social factors. However, if the capacity to create and consume art evolved as a mechanism to shape shared attention, it is possible that environmental factors may indeed play a role in variation of decorative style. We tested this hypothesis by characterizing the compositional structure of 198 textiles from eighteen cultures across the globe using the complexity-entropy plane. Entropy and statistical complexity have previously been used to characterize changes in the compositional structure of paintings of the Western canon over the last millennium. We observed that complexity and entropy are useful measures for characterizing traditional textile designs: high-entropy/low-complexity samples feature dense repetitions of small Euclidean shapes, while low-entropy/high-complexity samples feature large, single-color fields with bold borders. We observed weak-but-significant associations between these measures and three environmental variables: absolute latitude, Koppen climate classification, and a composite variable representing subsistence mode. Interestingly, we observed a significant difference between works from Afro-Eurasia/Oceania and the Americas. Controlling for this and other factors related to social transmission improves the strength of the relationship between compositional structure and subsistence mode. We propose that aesthetic preferences may be affected by subsistence mode as well as cultural factors, and suggest that further studies with more granular environmental data are necessary. We further discuss potential explanations for the observed difference between ""hemispheres.""",Sociology

In this paper, we seek to explain this puzzle by studying the role of informal networks in explaining insurance-adoption behavior in the context of the Arogyasri health insurance program introduced in the erstwhile state of Andhra Pradesh between 2007 and 2008. We use household panel data from the Young Lives Survey (YLS) to empirically study how the adoption of Arogyasri among poor households respond to their membership in informal networks. In this context, we differentiate between two types of network – financial network and information network. We find that adoption and utilization are significantly higher for households with access to informal financial networks. However, adoption and utilization increases much more for households outside informal networks, after they experience health shocks. Information sharing role of informal networks do not seem to affect the decision to adopt insurance. We also provide a simple theoretical framework to discuss the potential mechanisms underlying our empirical results.",Sociology

To overcome this knowledge gap, we employ the innovative approach of data donation by respondents of a high-quality probability-based panel in the Netherlands (the LISS panel) to collect user data while preserving their privacy. Focusing on WhatsApp as the most popular MIMS, this study collects the first measurement of MIMS usage on a national probability sample.

This study aims to change air conditioner use by tourists – consumers whose sense of moral obligation is reduced and, with it, their level of pro-environmental behaviour. We test several theory-informed interventions aimed at encouraging hotel guests to set their air conditioners to comfortable but less energy-intensive temperatures. We compare cognitive-based interventions, such as activating social norms, with affective-based interventions that anthropomorphise air conditioners to evoke empathy. Intervention effectiveness is tested across three studies: a traditional survey experiment (to measure the manipulation of target constructs), two ecologically enhanced survey experiments (measuring behaviour intentions), and a field experiment measuring air conditioner use indirectly using wireless temperature sensors. Results indicate that interventions leveraging social norms and anthropomorphism, specifically those evoking negative emotions like exhaustion and anger, significantly influence air conditioner use. Enhanced survey formats cannot replace field experiments to assess an intervention’s impact on behaviour. Our findings suggest that simple, cost-effective interventions can promote more sustainable air conditioning practices in hotels, ultimately contributing to reduced carbon emissions and operational costs.",Sociology

We explored how different personas and experimental framings affect these AI agents' altruistic behavior in dictator games and compared their behaviors within the same LLM family, across various families, and with human behaviors. The findings reveal substantial variations and inconsistencies among LLMs and notable differences compared to human behaviors. Merely assigning a human-like identity to LLMs does not produce human-like behaviors. Despite being trained on extensive human-generated data, these AI agents are unable to capture the internal processes of human decision-making. Their alignment with human is highly variable and dependent on specific model architectures and prompt formulations; even worse, such dependence does not follow a clear pattern. LLMs can be useful task-specific tools but are not yet intelligent human-like agents.",Sociology
1583,,"In the hotel industry, the management of room temperatures plays a crucial role in both environmental impact and energy costs. Small changes, such as reducing heating by 1°C, can save around 6% on electricity. Despite the significant impact, there is a notable scarcity of interventions aimed at promoting sustainable air conditioner use among guests. Most pro-environmental behaviour-change interventions in tourism focus on environmental messaging and negative appeals, with mixed effectiveness. Positive emotions like amusement (humour) and self-transcendent emotions (compassion) have been largely overlooked but have shown potential in other research contexts. The current series of studies assesses the comparative effectiveness of messages designed to trigger humour, compassion, and environmental beliefs on sustainable air conditioner use. In Study 1, we develop and evaluate four alternative messages for each theoretical construct. We use the most effective message for each construct (e.g., the most amusing humour message) in Studies 2 and 3. Study 2 serves as a manipulation check to ensure the messages effectively triggered the intended theoretical constructs. It also assesses behavioural intentions and emotional reactions. Study 3 tests the impact of the interventions on real behaviour in a quasi-experimental field study. Study 2 shows that each message effectively strengthens its respective theoretical construct (e.g., the environmental message strengthened environmental beliefs). The field study demonstrates that all three messages, along with a basic behaviour instruction message, increase sustainable air conditioner use. The humour message had an advantage over the others, being positively perceived by participants and not causing negative reactions. Therefore, framing sustainable air conditioner use instructions humorously appears to be a promising strategy in the hotel context. While our humour message is tailored to the Australian winter context, future research should explore the applicability of humour-based interventions in diverse cultural and climate settings to enhance sustainable air conditioner practices globally.",Sociology
1584,,"Epidemiology is a field in which the aim is to identify the characteristics, causes and means of control of conditions that exist outside of physiological norms. For both infectious and non-infectious diseases, genetic, physiological, environmental, and behavioural factors can all influence the risk of acquiring disease, meaning that, despite differences in how they manifest, the problems and solutions associated with them can be remarkably similar.

Epidemiology has always made use of ideas and techniques from other disciplines that help to achieve its aims, but typically takes a “toolbox” approach, bringing in data, techniques and methods and insights that support epidemiologists to solve problems they already perceive as important. However, it is not necessarily sufficient for tackling “wicked” disease problems which may require  long-term investments in interdisciplinary teams, with members working together in finding shared solutions to disease, and to educate and be educated in different disciplinary perspectives on the problem. For endemic diseases in particular, while methods of control and even eradication do exist it is often the case that they are not put into practice. Here, we address two exemplar endemic diseases in the context of farming in England: Bovine Viral Diarrhoea (BVD) in cows, and lameness in cattle and sheep. These diseases were selected because of their significance to UK livestock agriculture and their contrasting epidemiologies. Both are highly impactful and have been recognised for at least half a century as among the biggest threats to livestock health, welfare and productivity in England. In both cases, while historically embedded social factors have been central to their persistence, the reluctance of social scientists and and historians to issue normative guidelines means that they are less able to offer explicit advice to policy, hindering the adoption of broader interdisciplinary perspectives. 

To fill some of the gaps in that advice, here we suggest approaches to bringing a broad range of observers to bear on them.  First, while BVD and lameness are both quite well understood and ‘educating’ farmers (as often advocated in studies informed by ‘theory of planned behaviour approaches’) by treating veterinary perspectives as normative is unlikely to be universally successful. Farmers’ perspectives often have their own logics that are informed by individual circumstances and past experiences which veterinarians and other advisors can fail to appreciate. Second, we note that both farmers and consumers have shown they value health in terms of impacts on welfare and production, however ‘welfare’, like ‘health’ is likely to be perceived differently by farmers compared to veterinarians, and this requires further study. Finally, the new policy contexts of animal health as public good presents important opportunities. 

Beyond these general lessons, there are also particular issues for each disease. For BVD, with the uneven distribution of costs and benefits, differences in farming perspectives make it highly unlikely that the industry will come together around a voluntary BVD eradication scheme that rests on testing and trading controls. and much can be learned from the countries that are already on that journey or have reached their destination. By contrast, for lameness, where risk-factors are multi-factorial and usually highly localized, universal approaches make little sense. Here, industry-led schemes make more sense because lameness control (unlike BVD) is not a zero-sum game. Moreover, because lameness is pathologically and epidemiologically complex, and rooted in farming systems that can be difficult to change substantially, eradication is extremely hard if not impossible to achieve so local measures make more sense. In both cases, greater understanding of farmer priorities can help to identify ways to make farmers and other farm-based actors such as family members and farm workers more amenable to scientific advances, by identifying (ahead of time) potential barriers.

1585,,"Este ensayo analiza la creciente influencia de las narrativas personales en la formación de hábitos alimenticios, en comparación con las recomendaciones basadas en evidencia científica. Las historias personales, a menudo derivadas de experiencias cotidianas, conectan emocionalmente con el público, haciendo que los cambios en la dieta parezcan más alcanzables y motivadores. Este tipo de narrativas, especialmente difundidas por influencers, puede tener un impacto fuerte o de gran impacto en los seguidores. Sin embargo, la dependencia de experiencias subjetivas sobre recomendaciones científicas conlleva riesgos, ya que puede promover prácticas alimenticias inseguras. En la era de las redes sociales, entre el 40% y el 60% de la población tiende a seguir consejos de figuras públicas en lugar de expertos en nutrición, lo que contribuye a la desinformación. Este ensayo subraya la importancia de que los profesionales de la salud promuevan información basada en evidencia científica de manera accesible y atractiva, compitiendo con el impacto emocional de las narrativas personales, para fomentar hábitos alimenticios seguros y sostenibles en un entorno sobresaturado de información",Sociology

Since openly revealing an intention to leave the organization may result in unfavorable working conditions or discomfort, respondents may be reluctant to report their intentions when asked directly. In February 2023, we conducted an online survey of 719 public sector employees, which included both a direct question about turnover intention and a list experiment. We find that 15.07% of respondents reported turnover intention in the list experiment, compared to 7.15% in the direct question, suggesting underreporting. We also find that the difference between these two estimates is greater for female respondents than for male respondents, implying a higher desirability bias among female civil servants.",Sociology
1587,,"The concept of the Vienna School of Comparative Musicology, later renamed as Vienna School of Comparative-Systematic Musicology, plays an important role in received historical accounts of musicology in twentieth-century Austria (used as shorthand for the various political entities to which the territory of post-World War II Austria belonged). The concept was developed in the second half of the twentieth century, most notably by Walter Graf (1903–1982) and Franz Födermayr (1933–2020), both former professors of comparative(-systematic) musicology at the University of Vienna. Proponents of this concept point to Richard Wallaschek (1860–1917) and especially Robert Lach (1874–1958) as the founders of the school and emphasize the synthetic character of the Vienna School, combining approaches from the natural sciences, social sciences, and humanities. 
The Vienna School of Comparative-Systematic Musicology can be analyzed as a historiographical narrative, as a coherent story of how a particular branch of Austrian musicology developed over time, mostly as a kind of “Whig history.” This paper examines key aspects of this narrative: Who contributed to its construction? How did the narrative evolve over time? Which scholars, institutions, and types of research are part of the narrative? Which are excluded or appear only as supporting characters? How is this particular form of comparative-systematic musicology represented in relation to other forms and schools of (comparative) musicology? What discursive function(s) did this narrative serve? How was it received? And to what extent has it remained relevant in the present?",Sociology
1588,,"The province of Almería in Spain is home to one of the largest concentrations of greenhouse agriculture in the world, covering over 32,000 hectares and producing more than 3.8 million tonnes of fruits and vegetables largely for export across Europe. Migrant agricultural workers here face precarious working and living conditions, which profoundly shape their relationships with food, ingredients, and cooking. The food system in this region is deeply entwined with global food consumption practices, extractivist supply chains, and irregular migration patterns. While much research has focused on the economic and environmental impacts of industrial agriculture, less attention has been given to how migrant workers’ interactions with food reflect their social and cultural identities amidst these challenges. This study protocol outlines our aims and methods to explore these relationships, examining how migration and labour conditions influence food-related practices, and how these practices serve as means of cultural preservation, adaptation, and survival. Using a collaborative photo-elicitation methodology, we will work with migrant workers in Almería to document their relationship with food through photography and interviews. Participants will be asked to capture images of their daily food practices over a 7-10 day period. These photographs will later serve as both prompts for semi-structured interviews and a source of visual data, facilitating deeper reflections on personal, cultural, and socio-economic contexts surrounding food. Data will be analysed through qualitative content analysis, incorporating co-creation and member checking to ensure accuracy and participant agency. The planned research aims to provide critical insights into the social, cultural, and environmental impacts of industrial agriculture on migrant workers, contributing to a broader understanding of food justice, labour exploitation, and the sustainability of global food systems.",Sociology
1589,,"How does stakeholder participation in natural resource management change when conservation rules are grounded in near real-time data? Recognition of our rapidly changing climate and recent technological advances have facilitated the increased feasibility of the “dynamic management” of natural resources, which promises to align the spatiotemporal scales of management with ecological variability and resource use. Drawing on Kelty’s (2020) concept of “contributory autonomy,” this article offers a critical comparison of how participation is conceived of in the more established context of static conservation areas and planning versus the emergent field of dynamic management. A systematic review of the dynamic ocean management literature reveals a varied, but shallow engagement with the topic of stakeholder participation in that context. Whereas static management regimes are governed by intuitive and readily contestable maps, dynamic management is governed by models and data flows. Overall, the decision-making stakeholder of participatory mapping processes under static management is displaced by the stakeholder conceived as an “end user” of a dynamic management product. Yet, these shifts also open up potential points of contestation, which may pattern the future theory and practice of participation in dynamic management: counterdata, countermodeling, and data chokepoints. Beyond the empirical focus on oceans, this article contributes to broader conversations about the political stakes of environmental data, and algorithmic and artificial intelligence-driven natural resource conservation by considering how possibilities for participation are foreclosed, enabled, and reconstituted by new spatiotemporal and technological conditions.",Sociology
1590,,"Should a set of hypothetical interventions eliminate the Black-White gap in malleable factors such as schooling, how much racial disparity in subsequent youth development would be reduced and how much would remain? To address this question, a causal decomposition analysis must credibly identify the causal impact of intervening on the malleable factors. However, major confounders such as parental SES are intermediate outcomes of systemic racism experienced over generations that place Black households and communities at a great disadvantage. For this reason, an intervention that attempts to eliminate the Black-White gap in schooling within levels of parental SES or other endogenous confounders has two major problems: (1) Such an attempt is infeasible when only one but not both racial groups are present within some extreme levels of parental SES. (2) Even if both groups are present within every level of parental SES, the attempt would nonetheless fail to eliminate the marginal Black-White gap in schooling due to the endogeneity of parental SES. We propose a novel solution that replaces the original scale of an endogenous confounder with a scale preserving one’s within-group relative standing. A semiparametric weighting strategy then emulates the counterfactual outcome of an equity-oriented intervention. Our analysis of the NLSY 1997 data reveals real-world implications of the methodological dilemma posed by endogenous confounding.",Sociology

Este problema se ha propagado ampliamente en redes sociales debido a la falta de estrategias regulatorias y a la proliferación de influenciadores no cualificados que se establecen como líderes de información

Objetivos:  Analizar la responsabilidad ética de los profesionales de la salud en la difusión de información nutricional en redes sociales, resaltando la importancia de garantizar que dicha información esté científicamente respaldada.

Métodos: Se realizó un ensayo académico a partir de la revisión de literatura en bases de datos científicas como PubMed, NCBI, BMC Medical Ethics y JMIR, entre otras, basada en estudios recientes sobre la difusión de desinformación nutricional en redes y los principios éticos que guían a los profesionales de la salud en la comunicación digital.

Resultados:  El análisis de la bibliografía seleccionada reveló que existe una gran presencia de individuos en redes sociales que comparten datos erróneos no verificables, y que se establecen como autoridades en temas relacionados con nutrición, sin poseer las acreditaciones necesarias, reforzando su credibilidad ante el público mediante técnicas de comunicación novedosas, marketing y publicidad, y compartiendo información falsa en forma de dietas y consejos nutricionales que es recibida ampliamente por un público altamente influenciable. Esta conducta representa un riesgo significativo para la población y la salud pública, ya que la falta de verificación de la información y la ausencia de pensamiento crítico acerca de lo que se publica en las diversas plataformas ha llevado a la propagación de prácticas nutricionales nocivas. 

Conclusiones: El ensayo concluye que los profesionales de la salud no solo tienen la responsabilidad ética de difundir información científicamente respaldada, sino que también tienen el deber de denunciar activamente la desinformación que encuentren en redes sociales. La formación en competencias digitales y pensamiento crítico son cruciales para que lograr enfrentar eficazmente la desinformación y educar al público.

Basándome en teorías sobre prejuicio, discriminación y colonialismo, sostengo que en países colonizados y postcoloniales, los vendedores locales de viviendas discriminan contra potenciales compradores locales, mientras favorecen a extranjeros con un poder adquisitivo esperado más alto, anticipando una transacción más rentable. Apoyo este argumento con evidencia de un estudio de auditoría en línea pre-registrado que examina actitudes discriminatorias hacia compradores de viviendas locales.

1596,,"After nearly half a century, domestic workers were again tabled on the agenda of the International Labour Conference in 2008. Three short years later, Conference delegates voted to establish the International Labour Organization’s Convention on Domestic Work (C189).  This paper builds on the insight that the campaign to push for C189 was taken up by a feminist “velvet triangle”.  These networks are usually comprised of women in social movements, femocrats and academics. The informality of these alliances is due, in part, to the gendered marginality of an issue area, allowing for improvisation and agile coalitions.  The paper traces the origins of this triangle to bottom-up calls to develop measurement methodologies to make women’s labour “visible” in the UN Conferences on Women, and later in discussions about the informal economy.  It then examines the relations among femocrats in the ILO, academics, and the global trade unions in one important element of the campaign – mobilising statistics on domestic workers worldwide.  The paper demonstrates how the production and mobilisation of statistical estimates were crucial in making the sector more tractable.  It attends to the under-explored effects of the “power of cognitive resources” in the literature.  Finally, the article shows that the explicitly political project of the women’s movements yielded not only a normative labour instrument, but advances in different fields of study. This case shows that the production of scientific knowledge, while still an overwhelmingly elite endeavour, need not always cater to elite demands.",Sociology

Key findings include:
Skill Demand: Digital expertise such as SEO, audience data analysis, social media management, and multimedia production is increasingly required, while AI skills remain emergent.
Work Experience: Experience requirements vary by country, with the U.S. demanding more advanced experience. Not surprisingly, more experience correlates with higher salaries.
Academic Degree: A university degree is often required in the U.S. and France, though less so in the other countries. A degree generally enhances salary prospects, but work experience has a larger impact.
Salary Transparency is inconsistent, with only one-third of ads including salary details, mostly from NYT and CNN. Annual salaries range from $16k for entry level to $300k for a senior producer at CNN.
Diversity: U.S. and Australian outlets are leading in addressing diversity, with many job ads including statements about inclusivity across gender, ethnicity, religion, and disability.

While this was understood since Engel, who first tabulated these expenditures, the nature of the demand function itself remained unresolved. Economics of consumption is redefined here in terms of its basic variables, income and expenditures, in a self-consistent universal hierarchy. The analyses so far did not take into account a correction for income though the preference for consumption is primarily hierarchical. Using data from National Sample Survey Organization of India, we demonstrate the universality of the rectangular hyperbola that defines the consumption for each commodity on the basis of residual income, by deducting expenditures of higher preference based on elasticity coefficients. Since different commodities show a hierarchy of hyperbolic functions, both in the rate at which the saturation is achieved as well as the saturation itself, we needed a commodity for which the critical time constant (accounting for the hyperbolic function) is known and invariant, viz., educational expenditures. The year-wise income classes of parents that reflect the relevant expenditures for education of Brazilian children, compiled earlier by Costa Ribiero, uniquely show a constant hyperbolic function for all the years when analyzed in terms of ‘residual income’.

A change of relationship with Traditional Custodians and a rethinking of current engagement approaches could create a more responsible process.

The research, ‘Voicing First Nations Country, culture and community in urban policy’, undertaken for AHURI by researchers from University of Sydney, RMIT University and University of NSW, examines the relationship of First Nations peoples in Australia to urban policy, and is designed to centre First Nations sovereignty, authority, knowledge, governance and agency as the starting point toward a more responsible relationship.

Urban places, from large metropolitan areas to small towns in regional areas, are sites of intensive dispossession at the same time as being dense networks of community and ongoing cultural practice and connection. Nevertheless, urbanisation and the density of population settlement, private property and the miasma of legislation, policy and regulation imposed on Country hasn’t destroyed First Nations Traditional Custodians connection to ancestral lands or their cultural obligations and rights to lands and waters.

Governments are asking local planners and developers to consult with First Nation Traditional Custodians with some level of engagement. This has the effect of intensifying pressure on Custodians, with short timeframes and often unrealistic expectations imposed upon First Nations communities.

Urban policy planning can be a tool for healing and repair between First Nations people and the broader Australian community. Engagement can be used to create new opportunities—but current engagement approaches require rethinking and need to include building longer term relationships, long before a project requires engagement.

We conducted a representative in-person survey across five major Colombian cities, covering about 7 million residents. The survey included a vignette experiment presenting respondents with one of four scenarios that varied police officer respectfulness—characterized by clear communication of intentions—and neutrality. Our findings reveal that respectful behavior from officers significantly boosts citizens' perceptions of police legitimacy. In contrast, neutrality alone, or even combined with respect, does not affect these perceptions. This suggests that respect is an important component of procedural justice in fostering police legitimacy, while the standalone importance of neutrality is questionable. Policymakers should note that emphasizing respectful interactions in police training can foster greater trust and cooperation within communities, aiding effective crime prevention and community policing efforts. Conversely, focusing solely on neutrality without ensuring respect may be insufficient, possibly due to citizens' biases toward specific stereotypes.",Sociology

This paper examines three mechanisms identified in the literature that contribute to this perception among migrants: exposure to actual discrimination through social contacts, language proficiency and awareness, and unmet aspirations. Using a subset of the European Social Survey dataset, which includes approximately 45,000 first- and second-generation migrants, we analyse the effects of individual characteristics (migrant generation, language skills, social contacts, education, and training) and contextual characteristics (integration policies) on perceived discrimination. Our findings reveal the existence of an ""Integration Paradox,"" particularly for Muslim migrants. More integrated Muslim migrants, especially those from the second generation, report higher levels of perceived discrimination. We also find that the integration setting does not have a direct effect but moderates the relationship between migrant generation and perceived discrimination. Notably, second-generation Muslim migrants feel most discriminated against in countries with ""intermediate"" levels of integration policies, suggesting short-term unintended consequences of such policies. These findings underscore the importance of paying close attention to this group in the present and near future, especially given their steadily increasing presence in European societies.",Sociology

The results suggest diverse educator-child interaction patterns mediating children’s inclusion. In educator-child interactions, children’s diverse agency for participation is considered by educators. Educators’ approaches to diversity suggest their open attitudes towards inclusion which are not limited to ethnicity but relate to children’s individual needs. During moments of tension within educator-child interactions, children’s agency contributes to transform educators’ attitudes towards inclusion.

Despite having declared the death of functionalism, some form of functionalist argument still remains cryptically present in much substantive research. We argue that this inability to talk plainly about functions is a major hindrance for theory building in the discipline. As such, this article has two goals. The first is disambiguation. What does it mean to attribute a function to something? We answer this question by elaborating on the distinction between proper functions (responding to why-is-it-there questions) and role functions (responding to how-does-it-work questions). The second is to introduce a typology of functional arguments that builds upon this distinction. This allows us to recast “functionalism” as a set of general explanatory strategies and not as a substantive theory about society. This framework enables us to better evaluate, challenge, and improve upon much of the sociological research that currently relies on these forms of argument. Importantly, these forms of argument are not burdened with the problems associated with the organicist framework many sociologists have in mind when they think of functionalism.",Sociology

Over the course of this series, the study has examined the Danish Golden Age's cultural and intellectual context, along with the influence of German Romanticism and Hegelian philosophy on Kierkegaard's development. In this concluding work, irony is explored as a key philosophical tool in On the Concept of Irony with Constant Reference to Socrates (1841). The analysis argues that irony is not merely a tool for destruction but a dialectical means that leads to authentic subjectivity.

The paper explores the philosophical influences that shaped Kierkegaard's concept of irony, particularly his critique of Romantic irony for its nihilistic tendencies. Building on these influences, Kierkegaard formulates the idea of ""controlled irony,"" which allows individuals to confront life's contradictions without losing connection to ethical reality.

Counter-movements did not consistently produce opposing frames for each hate frame but rather developed independent messaging focused on combating racism itself.

This study compares the relevance of biological parent and stepparent involvement for children’s well-being, including stepmother and stepfather families, while accounting for children’s residence. Multiple regression analyses were conducted using the New Families in the Netherlands (NFN) survey, large-scale data collected among divorced and separated parents with minor children (2015/16; N = 3218). Involvement in routine activities was not associated with children’s well-being. Biological parent and stepparent involvement in interactive activities was positively associated with well-being, except when biological parent involvement was (too) frequent. Children, on average, benefited equally from the interactive involvement of both parent types. Biological parent involvement had a stronger positive association with child well-being than stepparent involvement only when involvement was rare. Yet, when involvement was (overly) frequent, stepparent involvement was related to better well-being, with the opposite effect for biological parents. These findings are consistent between stepmother and stepfather families. This study, overall, indicates that interactive activities are important to the well-being of most children, whether undertaken by biological parents or stepparents.",Sociology

Using restricted-access census microdata, I examined the segregation of the 12 largest immigrant groups to the Japanese majority and among each other. I then assessed the relationship between dissimilarity and factors affecting integration using pooled linear regressions and individual location attainment models. My findings reveal that all immigrant groups exhibit high residential segregation from the Japanese majority and notable pairwise segregation. There is a general trend of spatial assimilation that higher levels of socioeconomic factors predict less segregation, while Brazilians and Peruvians, the earliest contemporary immigrant group who arrived in Japan as ethnic descendants, demonstrate a pronounced tendency towards place stratification. These observations provide support for both spatial assimilation and place stratification theory in the Japanese context. Moreover, there is a strong trend of self-segregation among highly skilled elite, particularly Western immigrants from the Japanese majority and peer immigrants.

portrayed as a result of the physical and mental decline inherently associated with
ageing. These representations reinforce the image of older women as vulnerable
subjects who are weak, frail and excluded from society. This article proposes an
alternative reading of expressions of unruliness related to ageing, gender and
sexuality in Western media and visual culture through the lens of Halberstam’s
concept of gaga feminism. The aim is to explore how gaga feminism’s aesthetics of
collapse, creative anarchy and experimentation can construct new constellations of
ageing, sexuality and gender. We have conducted a critical, contextualised reading
of a selection of cultural artefacts that express various elements of a gaga aesthetic.
Our analysis reflects on the three central principles of gaga, specifically (1) new
forms of social relations and sexualities, (2) more fluid articulations of gender and (3)
creative anarchy; and on what they can mean for an anti-ageist project in media and
visual culture. In this way, this article offers insights into the creative and unruly ways
in which ageism, heteronormativity and sexism can be subverted and destabilised in
representations.",Sociology
1619,,"When do autocrats replace their ministers? Research suggests that failed coup attempts lead autocrats to remove disloyal ruling elites. While this is an important and intuitive finding, failed coup attempts are very rare events and hence leave large amounts of variation in minister removal unexplained. It also portrays autocrats as reactionary, whereas previous work suggests that they are anticipatory and survival-seeking. We argue that autocratic leaders are strategic actors who take preemptive action against potentially disloyal elites, rather than risking a coup attempt being realized. Using structural coup risk as a lower estimate of a leader's own perception of coup risk, we find that it significantly contributes to the prediction of minister removals. Contrasting its effect to that of failed coup attempts, we find that it substantially improves predictive performance across a number of metrics. Our findings contribute to nascent research on government stability and autocratic leader survival.",Sociology
1620,,"Objective: This study identifies the prevalence of sandwich care, and describes demographic, socioeconomic, health, and care characteristics of sandwich carers compared with other care groups in the UK.
Background: Delayed childbearing and increasing care needs mean that parenting young children may increasingly coincide with the need to provide adult care, leading to so-called ‘sandwich care’, but little is known about sandwich carers in the UK.
Method: Using eleven waves of the UK Household Longitudinal Study (2009-2020), a large, nationally representative household panel survey in the United Kingdom, five care groups were derived based on information regarding provision of adult care and living with children aged under age 16 (N=81,057). The prevalence of these groups were shown across waves, then waves were pooled and multinomial regression models were used to show age-adjusted differences in demographic, socioeconomic, health and care characteristics across the five care groups. 
Results: 2% of the UK adult population provide sandwich care . Parents caring for someone in the generation above were generally employed in professional/managerial occupations and cared less intensively outside the household while parents caring for a disabled child or partner were disadvantaged in terms of education and income, and tended to care intensively inside the household. 
Conclusion: It is important to recognise circumstances of care groups are heterogenous when designing policies and practice to support family carers.",Sociology

Drawing on science and technology studies (STS), it seeks to move beyond the opacity/transparency dichotomy that often characterizes discussions of algorithmic systems. In doing this, the article hones in on actors’ mundane practices of constructing machine learners, and develops an analytical stance based on four empirical moments: feature extraction, vectorization, clustering, and data drift. By making visible actors’ work, tinkering, and negotiations involved in these processes, the article aims to demystify the supposed magic of machine learning. This approach allows us to ask: How do actors decide what constitutes a good machine learner? How are things, people, and phenomena translated into the mathematical worlds of machine learning? Through ethnographic attention to these questions, we can begin to grapple with the practices and politics of machine learning in earnest. Thus, the article contributes to ongoing discussions about the societal implications of AI by providing analytical and methodological tools for understanding how the politics of machine learning is assembled in practice.",Sociology

Thematic analysis is used to analyse interview data collected from five mainstream classroom teachers and five special education classroom teachers working in two regular schools and one special education school. Results suggest that “education for all” in the same class is a shared value among classroom teacher participants. However, mainstream and special education classroom teachers’ views are in conflict in terms of inclusive practices. While mainstream classroom teachers are concerned with pupils’ academic learning, special education classroom teachers are relegated to pedagogies of differentiation in separate and segregated settings. For education to become truly inclusive, more expertise on inclusive pedagogies must be integrated into future teacher training programs, in order to improve mainstream classroom teachers’ commitment to inclusion.",Sociology

1624,,"Spatial mobility plays a crucial role in shaping social stratification processes. While previous research focused on adult workers’ monetary returns from commuting or relocating, early career gains in occupational status may be more significant from a life course perspective. We examine whether spatial mobility yields status returns for labor market entrants and, if so, how such returns might be stratified by young people’s local opportunity structures and their level of schooling. We use longitudinal data from the German National Educational Panel Study merged with fine-grained regional information and focus on transitions from school to Vocational Education and Training (VET). As a novel approach to address the methodological challenge of self-selection into spatial mobility, we propose incorporating young people’s occupational aspirations into the regression analysis. We show that mobile young people are more likely to get higher-status VET positions. Yet, being spatially mobile only pays off if young people commute or move away from structurally weak regions and for those with higher levels of schooling who are already privileged in status attainment. We conclude that young people can potentially overcome regional disadvantages through spatial mobility, while spatial mobility also tends to widen the gap in status attainment between educational groups.",Sociology

What are the functions of image editing guidelines in journalistic organizations, based on the guidelines themselves and the explanations given by the authors? 2. What are the possible consequences for photojournalists and the public if these functions conflict? The analysis shows that the boundary work function strongly conflicts with the governance function and accountability function. Guidelines for image editing in photojournalism reinforce the myth that ‘news photos are objective’ for the purpose of defining the field of photojournalism (boundary work). As a result, guidelines do not function as well as a quality assurance tool and as a media accountability system, with adverse consequences for photojournalists and the public.",Sociology
1626,,"The distribution of research funding in academia is not equitable. There is a disproportionate allocation of funding benefitting an academic elite, whereas researchers from different marginalized groups have fewer opportunities to obtain funding. This can be changed by exploring alternative ways to allocate research funding. One way in which funding agencies have tried to stimulate research based on more equitable principles is the sandpit model. A sandpit is an intensive, multi-day brainstorming event during which different consortia are formed. These consortia are subsequently required to compete to obtain research funding. Very little research is done on how and whether such models work. There is some evidence that, under the right circumstances, models such as the sandpit can stimulate multidisciplinary research with societal impact. However, no attention has been given to the question whether these models contribute to equity within the academic world, or whether they sustain the inequities that are prominent. Within this paper, we critically examine possible mechanisms of exclusion through an in-depth study of a sandpit event, and we discuss which groups are disadvantaged by these events. Furthermore, we suggest ways in which sandpits and other funding initiatives can be made more equitable.",Sociology

On one hand, pXRF is essentially energy-dispersive XRF (EDXRF) condensed to fit into a handheld instrument. On the other hand, it is still often defined by a few strident critiques more than a decade ago, the focus of which were pXRF users, not the instruments. There were three themes in those critiques: perceived weaknesses in (1) research design, (2) element quantification, and (3) publishing, especially as it relates to data evaluation. Recently, Johnson et al. (2024) sought to address the third critique, by both surveying the literature and proposing a checklist of 18 variables that, they argue, should be published to “result in better science” from pXRF users. While this is an important topic, the study and list are flawed and, thus, will not achieve their goal. We do, though, share the aim of aiding archaeologists in becoming effective pXRF users. Here I adopt a different tack. Drawing on 24 years of X-ray spectrometry experience, my intent is to share knowledge that can help the expanding community of pXRF practitioners. Ranging in topic from safety to research design and common pitfalls, I aim to share my experience in a way that can, I hope, be useful to those beyond my own students.

1628,,"The purpose of this Feasibility Analysis Study (FAS) was to evaluate methods for producing valid national estimates under the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-being (NSCAW) IV sample design. The NSCAW IV design is a stratified two-stage, unequal probability design that restricts the sample to within L purposively selected states, where L is a number between 8 and 12. (L = 10 was assumed for most the analyses in this document). The design is fully consistent with the NSCAW IV’s primary objective (i.e., to provide detailed, precise state-level estimates for the L key states selected for the survey). However, an important secondary objective is to provide for valid national estimates, even though the sample design itself is not nationally representative. The FAS was conducted to determine whether the NSCAW IV L-state design could achieve this secondary objective. FAS confirmed that national estimates are indeed feasible. This report provides a summary of the FAS results and offers detailed, statistical evidence as to the NSCAW IV L-state design’s ability to produce valid national inferences. 
     State estimates can be produced from the NSCAW IV design by applying classical survey estimation techniques; however, national estimation requires nonprobability or so-called quasi-random estimation and modeling techniques. The FAS investigated two such estimation approaches: quasi-randomization weighting (QRW) and superpopulation modeling (SPM). Data from prior NSCAW cohorts—NSCAW I and II—were analyzed to simulate the NSCAW IV design. Fortunately, the NSCAW I and II designs are quite similar to what is proposed for NSCAW IV in that they both include a purposive selection of states—L = 8, in total. The key difference between their designs and NSCAW IV’s design is that the two prior surveys also included a random sample the “remainder” stratum (i.e., the combination of states that were not purposively selected). This remainder stratum provided for the unbiased national estimation in NSCAW I and II without the needed for nonprobability estimation approaches. However, the remainder stratum was initially ignored in application of the QRW and SPM to NSCAW I and II states to simulate the NSCAW IV design. Later in the analysis, the remainder stratum provided a mechanism to assessing the biases in the QRW and SPM national estimates. This was critical in order for the FAS analysis speculate on the potential bias risks for NSCAW IV national estimates using the sample estimation approaches.
     As the results in the report convincingly show, both the QRW and SPM approaches are capable of producing valid national estimates from the L-state design envisioned for NSCAW IV. QRW is recommended for the estimating the means of the vast majority of questionnaire characteristics; however, in situations where QRW may fail to produce accurate results, the SPM approach can then be implemented to produce more accurate results. One drawback of SPM is that it requires more effort and a higher level of statistical expertise to implement. 
The research reported in this document initially addresses the question of whether the QRW method can be feasibly applied to the NSCAW IV data to obtain valid national inferences based on a small number (8 ≤ L ≤ 12) of purposively selected sample of states. Variations of QRW were applied to the NSCAW I eight-state sample and then, using the combination of the state and remainder stratum samples, the quality of the QRW national estimates was evaluated by comparing them to the full sample, unbiased national estimates. A number of key quality indicators were analyzed for national estimates related to 26 NSCAW characteristics—23 variables that overlap with the NCANDS data and three Child Behavior Check List (CBCL)  characteristics from the survey questionnaire. Four types of estimates based solely on the eight-state data were computed: (1) unweighted estimates, (2) estimates based on the unadjusted NSCAW weights, (3) estimates derived from Method 1 weighting, and (4) estimates derived from Method 2 weighting. Estimates (1) and (2) were computed primarily to gain insight around the degree to which approaches (3) and (4) affect the bias of the unweighted and unadjusted eight-state estimates. Finally, the NSCAW I full sample estimates were computed, which provided the “gold-standard” estimates used to evaluate the quality of estimates (1) through (4) for national inference. Because the NSCAW IV design will use three domains—the eight NSCAW I domains were collapsed to create the three NSCAW IV domains and the quality analysis was repeated for these “ad hoc” domains.
     The NSCAW I QRW analyses demonstrated the success of these methods for extend inference from the NSCAW IV purposively selected state sample to the national level. Although some bias could remain in the estimates after weighting, the biases were significantly reduced from their unweighted counterparts for the vast majority of estimates. For substantive characteristics such as the CBCL variables, the biases in the QRW estimates were slightly larger but still acceptable for many research purposes. The results for the NSCAW I analysis were essentially confirmed using NSCAW II data: both data sets produced very similar results.
SPM offers an alternative to QRW for creating national estimates from the L-state design. Because it incorporates specific covariates that are the most highly correlated with the outcome variable, it can achieve much greater estimation accuracy than is possible with the more general QRW methodology. A key distinction between SPM and the QRW is that, although the latter can be applied to any outcome variable, SPM must be tailored to each specific outcome variable of interest; i.e., each questionnaire variable represents a dependent variable in its own customized model. Nevertheless, for questionnaire variables where the QRW estimates have, or are suspected to have, unacceptably large biases, SPM offers a less biased alternative and can be used to produce higher quality inferences. 
     The SPM analyses used the eight-state strata to project national estimates and then evaluated those estimates by comparing them to the corresponding national sample estimates that served as the gold standard. The results showed that, at least for the variables considered from NSCAW I and II, SPM produces excellent results, with very small biases in most instances. Based on these results, we believe the SPM approach is quite feasible for the NSCAW IV L-state design. Thus, its use is recommended for NSCAW IV, particularly in situations where QRW estimates are shown or suspected to be unacceptably biased.",Sociology

Among the 62,701 active resources indexed in the ROAD database, the Web of Science indexes 6,157 journals, while Scopus indexes 7,351, and OpenAlex indexes 34,217. A striking observation is the presence of 25,658 OA journals exclusively in OpenAlex, whereas only 182 journals are exclusively present in WoS and 373 in Scopus.
The geographical analysis focusses on two levels: continents and countries. As for disciplinary comparison, we use the ten disciplinary levels of the ROAD database.  Moreover, our findings reveal a striking similarity in OA journal coverage between WoS and Scopus. However, while OpenAlex offers better inclusivity and indexing, it is not without biases. WoS and Scopus predictably favor journals from Europe, North America and Oceania. Although OpenAlex presents a much more balanced indexing, certain regions and countries remain relatively underrepresented. Typically, Africa is proportionally as under-represented in OpenAlex as it is in WoS, and some emerging countries are proportionally less represented in OpenAlex than in WoS and Scopus.
These results underscore a marked similarity in OA journal indexing between WoS and Scopus, while OpenAlex aligns more closely with the distribution observed in the ROAD database, although it also exhibits some representational biases.",Sociology

Many parts of Seoul were converted into slum areas and aimless urbanisation lowered the quality of life in the Seoul metropolitan area. Pupils were excluded from education due to the lack of school infrastructure while citizens were exposed to crime and unemployment. In the middle of the population crisis, the metropolitan government of Seoul and the central government of South Korea paid attention to the potential of Gangnam as one of the candidate regions for the expansion of the Seoul metropolitan area. This review presents how Gangnam has transformed from an “empty land” to the “symbol of wealth” in the history of the Gangnam development and the expansion of the Seoul metropolitan area. The initial development plan tried to solve immediate housing problems derived from the lack of urban space and facility. After 20 years of the intensive development, Gangnam has transformed from a poor countryside region into the new economic centre and financial hub. Gangnam has become a symbol of wealth in South Korea where citizens and private companies would like to reside. On the other hand, many evictees lost their home and disappeared as nameless citizens behind the scenes of the development. The Gangnam-style development, the expertise of urban development acquired in Gangnam, can be thoroughly studied and transferred to other regions in South Korea and developing countries in the world, thus establishing Gangnam as a model case of metropolitan area expansion.

There are other types of hiring this role in science, which are not contemplated in this analysis, such as: Article 9, contracted, outsourced personnel, dependent on universities with functions in CONICET, among other possible still unidentified.
It was determined that there is a balanced composition of personnel from the undergraduate, graduate and postgraduate studies levels. By incorporating the gender variable, it can be seen that at the undergraduate and graduate training levels (non-university tertiary, intermediate and basic) are masculinized, while at the postgraduate training levels are feminized. In the analysis of the distribution of CPA personnel by career, we can see that there are more personnel in the Professional category: 1864 people vs 951, and that it is balanced in gender but this is not the same for the Technical career. Analyzing the Technical and Professional careers separately, it was found that there are people with a high level of training retained in the Technical category, a situation that affects women more than men. It can also be seen that in the Professional category, an analogous process occurs, in which the people who access this category with a level of training less than a bachelor's degree are mostly men, which confirms that there is greater pressure of training for women.

I show that the increase in the use of excessive force cannot be explained by changes in protester behavior. Empirical findings highlight the role of local authorities: the election of a pro-mining mayor is associated with a higher prevalence of state repression and corruption in the constituency. The legal and democratic accountability of local authorities is, however, found to be limited.

1641,,"Introduction
Weight is the most common reason for being bullied at school - far more common than other targets for bullying such as ethnicity, religion or sexual orientation. Research suggests weight bias and stigma - including negative beliefs, attitudes, and discriminatory behaviours related to a person’s weight - is prevalent in educational settings among both pupils and staff.
Most schools have anti-bullying policies with best practice suggesting policies should explicitly identify forms of unacceptable behaviour, such as racism or homophobia.  
We conducted an audit of secondary schools in southwest England to determine if/how they mention weight-related bullying in their policies. 
Methods
We obtained lists of all secondary mainstream state, private, and specialist schools in seven local authorities and downloaded anti-bullying policies from their websites. Policies were searched for key words related to weight and size. We also recorded whether policies mentioned appearance or other key targets for bullying, such as race, religion, sexuality etc. We obtained school level data including size, gender mix, academic performance and quality ratings. 
Results
From 255 schools with an available bullying or behaviour policy, only 6.7% specifically mentioned weight-related bullying. Just under half (48.6%) mentioned bullying in relation to appearance. Bullying was most often mentioned in relation to race/ethnicity (94.5%), sexual orientation (93.3%), gender (85.9%), religion (84.9%), or gender identity (67.5%). Private schools (N=40) were more likely to mention weight-based bullying (17.5%) than mainstream state schools (N=148, 6.1%).  No specialist schools, whether state (N=41) or private (N=26), mentioned bullying in their policies. There was no strong evidence that other school characteristics made a difference, but small numbers limited the power of these comparisons. 
Conclusion
There is a significant mismatch between the prevalence of weight-related bullying in schools and its representation within school anti-bullying policies. Some types of school are more likely than others to mention weight-based bullying in their policies. We recommend that schools explicitly recognise weight-related bullying in their anti-bullying policies and explore how to support staff and pupil to take action.",Sociology

Structured Big Data allow us to estimate the contribution of women scientists to the growth of science by disciplines (N = STEMM 14 disciplines) and over time (1990-2023). A monolithic segment of STEMM science emerges from this research as divided between the disciplines in which the growth was powerfully driven by women – and the disciplines in which the role of women was marginal. There are four disciplines in which 50% of currently publishing scientists are women; and five disciplines in which more than 50% of currently young scientists are women. But there is also a cluster of four highly mathematized disciplines (MATH, COMP, PHYS, and ENG) in which the growth of science is only marginally driven by women. Digital traces left by scientists in their publications indexed in global datasets open two new dimensions in large-scale academic profession studies: time and gender. The growth of science in Europe was accompanied by growth in the number of women scientists, but with powerful cross-disciplinary and cross-generational differentiations.

Relative measures show higher mobility, with substantially less variation across time and subpopulations. The intergenerational correlation in lifespan (a measure of persistence rather than mobility) is about 0.09 for both sexes – this low correlation is observed across races, education groups, cohorts, and birth states.

However, we find no evidence that exposure to educated kin improves the nutritional status of these children.

The institutes with the largest number of support staff by area of ​​knowledge are: the INTEMA (Instituto de Investigaciones en Ciencia y Tecnología de Materiales) in the KA area (Agrarian, Engineering and Materials Sciences) with 47 RSS, followed by the MACNBR (Museo Argentino de Ciencias Naturales) in the KB area with 42 RSS, the CADIC (Centro Austral de Investigaciones Científicas) in the KE area with 38 RSS, and in the KS area there are two institutes that compete to be in first place with 14 RSS, which are: the CEIL (Centro de Estudios e Investigaciones Laborales) and the CAICYT (Centro Argentino de Información Científica y Tecnológica).	Regarding gender segregation by area of ​​knowledge, the feminized areas are: KB (Biological and Health Sciences), KS (Social Sciences and Humanities) and the masculinized areas: KA (Agrarian, Engineering and Materials Sciences); KE (Exact and Natural Sciences) and Not Applicable. The KT (Technology) area does not count any RSS personnel. It's curious that for the case of KA area (Agrarian, Engineering and Materials Sciences), the trend found for CONICET researchers is not reproduced by RSS because for them it is feminized, making it necessary to investigate the reasons for this deeply. The two areas with the largest number of support personnel assigned are KE: Exact and Natural Sciences; being masculinized, and KB: Biological and health sciences, being feminized. This analysis is a contribution to comprehension of the characteristics of CONICET's teem infrastructure roles, in order to advance the understanding of their work problems and barriers to professional growth.",Sociology

Theory and evidence indicate that reducing crime opportunities is an effective means of crime control, including restrictions on lethal weapons. While public debate has centred on zombie and other ‘status’ knives, the most prevalent homicide weapon is a kitchen knife. Here we argue that replacing lethal pointed-tip kitchen knives with round-tip knives would reduce knife crime with little or no displacement. Drawing on the approach to remove fossil-fuel vehicles from roads, we propose a phased removal of lethal kitchen knives that we estimate will cut knife-related homicide in half, reduce other knife crime and criminality, and prevent thousands of non-criminal knife-related injuries.",Sociology

However, access to these courses varies within and across school contexts, potentially shaping students’ educational trajectories. This study examines access to college prep courses in Texas, exploring how school characteristics predict course offerings and how these offerings predict course-taking. We also determine whether college prep course-taking affects postsecondary attainment within 12 years of high-school graduation. Results show that larger, urban, and suburban schools with higher academic achievement and less economic disadvantage offer more college prep courses. Schools offering more college prep courses see greater student course-taking, particularly among higher-achieving students. Additionally, taking more prep courses is associated with higher postsecondary credential and bachelor’s degree attainment, especially for lower-achieving students. We recommend that practitioners focus on increasing enrollment in existing college prep coursework, then expand offerings as demand grows.",Sociology

1649,,"Although partisan gerrymandering has been found to be widespread for congressional redistricting in the United States, there exists little empirical research on legislative redistricting in other countries. We investigate the partisan bias of Japanese redistricting. Some scholars have argued that the prominent role played by the nonpartisan commission leaves little room for partisan gerrymandering. Others have pointed out, however, that the Japanese redistricting process may be subject to political influence because the members of the redistricting commission must be appointed by the Prime Minister and approved by the Diet. In addition, the commission invites the governor of each prefecture to provide their opinions on redistricting. We conduct a systematic empirical analysis to estimate the partisan bias of the 2022 Japanese Lower House redistricting plans. We apply a state-of-the-art redistricting simulation algorithm to generate a large number of alternative nonpartisan redistricting plans. The sampled plans are representative of the population of plans and are consistent with the redistricting rules with which the commission must comply. By comparing the enacted plan with this nonpartisan baseline, we quantify the extent to which the enacted plan favors a particular party. Unlike the traditional methods, our simulation approach accounts for political geography and redistricting rules specific to each prefecture.  Our analysis shows that the Japanese redistricting process yields little partisan bias at both the prefecture and district levels.",Sociology
1650,,"Biodiversity declines are accelerating globally, impacting ecosystem functioning, with consequences for human health. Interactions with biodiversity can benefit human wellbeing, leading to avoided healthcare costs. However, existing research does not account for the species within ecological communities and their effect traits that elicit wellbeing (e.g. colours, sounds). Many species’ effect traits are seasonal, and spatial variation in exposure to ecosystems by different sectors of society can lead to unequal opportunities to gain wellbeing. Here, we use a novel analytical approach to explore how the relationship between forest biodiversity and wellbeing fluctuates: (1) temporally, between different seasons, and (2) spatially, across the socioeconomic deprivation continuum of a human population at a national scale (England and Wales). Forest species’ effect trait richness is spatially heterogeneous, particularly in autumn, spring, and summer. Broadleaf forests have greater species’ effect trait richness than other categories of forest. Forests with higher species’ effect trait richness, and forests that resulted in higher self-reported participant wellbeing, were in areas with the least socioeconomic deprivation. Forest creation/restoration and nature-health interventions must recognise this ecological and social diversity to ensure initiatives are equitable and socially just. Conserving biodiversity will therefore better deliver ecosystems that underpin healthier individuals and societies.",Sociology

Throughout the 19th century, mysticism played a consistent and integral role in the evolution of music within the German cultural sphere. The terminology of mystical or mysterious aesthetics was particularly prevalent in the works of composers such as Bach, Schumann, Weber, and Wagner. This connection ranges from Bach's religious expressions to the introspective and, at times, incomprehensible instrumental compositions emerging in the Hegelian era, through Weber’s fantastical initiation of Romanticism, Schumann’s poetic and mystical approach to the movement, and culminating in Wagner’s operatic revolution, which drew heavily on Germanic myths and legends. Across these various forms, mysticism maintained a close relationship with expressions of the inner self, religious sentiment, and the broader aesthetics of Romantic musical expression.",Sociology

1654,,"A quarter of a century has passed since the late Terry Crowley summed up the academic consensus that the creole language Bislama poses no immediate threat to any of Vanuatu’s Indigenous languages. Does this remain true today? Since that time, evidence both quantitative and qualitative has been accumulating that suggests Bislama is indeed gaining ground at the expense of Vanuatu’s Indigenous languages. In a targeted review of this evidence, this article brings together and assesses the insights of linguists, ethnographers, and others on the causal mechanisms that explain an ongoing shift towards Bislama. It thereby provides both a critical analysis of the current state of knowledge and a provisional causal framework for understanding current threats, predicting future threats and, potentially, intervening to prevent future threats. Language endangerment and extinction is a global issue with devastating implications for communities worldwide – one which Vanuatu, the world’s most linguistically diverse country, has thus far remained resilient in the face of. However, this review of the available evidence warns that Bislama will continue to disrupt intergenerational transmission of Indigenous languages unless a suite of inter-related mechanisms can be counteracted.",Sociology

This study systematically reviews existing theoretical models and seeks empirical evidence from the REF impact case data.

These stages encompass 10 key elements and 43 corresponding sub-categories, forming a novel theoretical model. Comparative analysis revealed that, while the generation of research impact beyond academia generally follows a similar logic across disciplines, obvious differences exist in motivation, research approach, forms of outputs, types of impacts, etc. This study further provides four typical cases for illustration. Our aim is to enhance the understanding of impact generation processes, promote the societal benefits of scientific research, and provide a basis for research managers to assess scientific contributions according to their distinct characteristics.",Sociology
1657,,"Objective: This study examines educational heterogeneity in the impact of parental separation on educational attainment, considering the full sequence of childhood family structural changes.
Background: Studies have consistently associated parental separation with lower socioeconomic achievement. However, the underlying causes remain unclear, possibly due to self-selection or continued instability in the family environment.
Method: This study employs structural causal modeling and Bayesian logistic regression to investigate the causal effect of childhood family structural changes on adult educational attainment using Finnish full-population register data (n = 272,962), focusing on cohorts born in 1987–1991 and their family members.
Results: A substantial portion of the 17-percentage-point disadvantage of children from separated families was due to the selection of families into separation and further structural changes. Separation effects followed a U-shaped pattern, with the largest negative effects among families in the middle of the educational gradient. Stepparents did not exert positive or negative effects, except for highly educated parents’ children benefiting from stable stepfathers. Recurring family instability had the largest negative impact.
Conclusion: The curvilinear relationship between parental and child education may partly explain the mixed results of previous studies.
Implications: Given that recurring family instability was shown to be the most detrimental to children’s educational attainment, low-threshold guidance and support to aspiring and existing blended families might have the largest impacts on children of separated parents.",Sociology

Yet while there is an extensive literature on descriptive gender representation in bureaucracies and courts, we largely lack studies that examine patterns of women’s presence on expert advisory bodies. Drawing on large-n data on the composition of Norwegian expert advisory commissions, the paper investigates and evaluates how the share of women on these commissions has developed over the last half-century. It finds that while overall gender parity was achieved in recent decades, women remain strongly under-represented among commission chairs, particularly academic chairs, and among commission members from economics, an especially important policy discipline. Normatively speaking, the developments towards parity are promising, and we find no empirical confirmation of the worry that proportional representation and competence requirements are in tension. On the contrary, persistent gender gaps among economists on commissions and academic chairs may endanger adequate provision of expertise into policy-making.",Sociology

We use interviews with wealthy German family business owners in media outlets between 2014 and 2019. Applying thematic analysis, we demonstrate that these wealthy business owners discursively link the past, present, and future of their family and business. By doing so, they emphasize hard work to explain family wealth transitions and how such wealth is accumulated across generations. This temporal self-narration about business success tied to family structure creates a powerful discursive strategy to legitimize their wealth.

1660,,"The average lifespan has increased strongly in the past decades, but not everyone has benefited equally. Establishing the degree of intergenerational persistence of survival generates insights into broad inequalities between individuals and families in their likelihood to live to high ages. Using established register-type data for a region in Southern Sweden 1880-2015, we show that even before the rise of the modern social gradient in health in the 1960ies, mortality is lower among descendants from long-lived parents (top survivors of their birth cohort). This shared survival advantage between parents and children persists over time even after considering SES. Mortality among the descendants of top survivors is lower in lifestyle-related causes of death, suggesting that behavioral factors could be a significant factor in explaining the survival advantage, but also. Overall, we find that mortality concentrates in families in patterns that go beyond the influence of SES alone. Similarities between relatives in health and mortality therefore provide an important lens into inequalities in survival and health over time.",Sociology

A multiplicity of claims from the literature highlight the tendency to claim almost any form from any period of prehistory as symbolic. After the problem is defined, an alternative approach is proposed. The alternative suggests grounding symbols and symboling in contemporary cognitive theory; this would permit the construct to be operationalized as qualities potentially discernable in prehistoric material forms. A multi-level construct is also proposed, one that is not only capable of differentiating symbolic cognition as exhibited by the human species today from the presumably non-symbolic cognition of contemporary non-human primates but which is also able to differentiate both from the emergent symboling capacities of ancestral hominins.",Sociology

Most US adults are not likely to experience severe cases of RSV infection, but adults aged 60 or older are at elevated risk of experiencing hospitalization or death due to RSV. While RSV vaccines are available for adults aged 60 or older, and have been shown to significantly reduce the likelihood that older adults experience severe cases of RSV, less than one quarter of those eligible have opted to receive the vaccine. In the context of RSV vaccination, Reversal Narrative (RN) messages share stories about individuals who previously refused to receive the vaccine, but – in response to personal negative health outcomes (“regret” RN messaging) and/or new scientific information (“rationalizing” RN messaging) – ultimately changed their mind. In a large and nationally representative survey (N = 1,300) of US adults, as well as a state-representative survey (N = 850) of a highly vaccinated US state, we demonstrate that unvaccinated adults over the age of 60 are significantly more likely to intend to receive an RSV vaccine when exposed to regret-focused (but not rationalizing) RN messaging. We conclude by discussing the viability of RN messaging as a vaccine promotion tactic, and consider how researchers might partner with health communicators to explore their viability in a wide range of health contexts.",Sociology
1666,,"Importance: While high levels of annual vaccination remains a key strategy for preventing the spread of new COVID-19 variants, most eligible Americans chose not to receive an updated vaccine in 2023. 

Objective: To assess the effectiveness of two new COVID-19 vaccine uptake communication strategies on annual COVID-19 vaccine uptake among vaccine hesitant sub-populations in a high vaccination state, and determine whether or not the messages “scale up” into an effective national messaging strategy. 

Design: We administered four randomized controlled trials embedded in two large and representative public opinion surveys before and following the availability of updated COVID-19 vaccines. Trials 1 and 2 were conducted in June 2023, and randomly exposed a representative cross-section of adults in a highly vaccinated state (Rhode Island; Trial 1, N = 800) and a nationally representative cross-section US adults (Trial 2, N = 1,000) with messages that normalize the risks posed by endemic COVID-19 (vs. a control group). Trials 3 and 4 were conducted in October 2023, and randomly exposed analogous state (Trial 3, N = 800) and nationally representative survey respondents (Trial 4, N = 1,200) to messages that “de-normalize” constantly-mutating viral threats posed by endemic COVID-19 (vs. a control group).   

Setting: Survey respondents were administered the trials online.

Participants: All adults aged 18 or over, residing in either the US (Trials 1, 3) or Rhode Island (specifically; Trials 2, 4), and who were members of a large, online, opt-in survey panel recruitment pool maintained by YouGov, were eligible for inclusion in this study.  

Interventions: Respondents were randomly assigned to read a short message promoting annual COVID-19 vaccine uptake (vs. a control group, shown an unrelated message). In Trials 1 and 2, messages either made an effort to (a) normalize COVID-19 as endemic (“normalization” [NORM]), (b) both normalize and highlight the Long COVID health risks posed by endemic COVID-19 (“normalization + risk” [NR]), or (c) a control message unrelated to vaccination. In Trials 3 and 4, respondents were randomly assigned to either read (a) the aforementioned “NORM” message, (b) a message “de-normalizing” (DENORM) COVID-19 as a constantly mutating viral risk, or (c) a study-wide control message.

Outcomes &amp; Measures: The primary outcome variable in this study measures respondents’ self-reported intentions to receive an annual COVID-19 vaccine. The primary explanatory variable in our analyses is an indicator of experimental condition assignment, stratified by whether respondents (a) received a full COVID-19 vaccine sequence &amp; at least one booster shot, (b) received some form of COVID-19 vaccination, but no boosters, or (c) are unvaccinated against COVID-19.

Results: In Trials 1 and 2, we find that unvaccinated Rhode Islanders exposed to the NR messaging, but not NORM messaging, were significantly more likely to intend to receive an annual COVID-19 vaccine (NORM: B = 0.13, CI = -0.03, 0.30, p = 0.11; NR: B = 0.22, CI = 0.00, 0.44, p = 0.05). In Trials 3 and 4, we find that exposure to DENORM messaging, but not NORM messaging, is also associated with annual COVID-19 vaccine uptake among unvaccinated Rhode Islanders (NORM: B = 0.19, CI = -0.03, 0.41, p = 0.10; DENORM: B = 0.23, CI = 0.01, 0.44, p = 0.04). We detect no significant effects in either of our national samples, which post hoc analyses suggest might result from observed and unobserved differences in unvaccinated populations across Rhode Island and national samples.

Conclusions: Our work suggests that messaging emphasizing both the endemic health risks (“NR”) and challenges of combating new COVID-19 variants (“DENORM”) may be effective at increasing annual COVID-19 vaccine uptake in unvaccinated populations, and suggest opportunities for future research regarding how differences in state public health contexts might moderate the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccine communication.",Sociology
1667,,"Social stratification is interested in unequal life chances and assumes the existence of a hierarchy of more or less advantageous occupations. Yet occupations are not easily translated into a linear hierarchical measure. Influential scales combine multiple indicators and lack intuitive interpretation. We present a new scale based on occupations’ earnings potential (OEP). The OEP scale measures the median earnings of occupations and expresses them as percentiles of the overall earnings structure: If machine mechanics earn the national median wage, their OEP is 50. We construct national OEP scales using annual microdata pooled over several decades for Germany, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK and US. Consistent with the Treiman constant, these national scales are highly correlated over time (r=0.90) and across countries (r=0.80), justifying the use of one common OEP scale. When applied to another European database, the common OEP scale explains a quarter of the variance in earnings – and performs as well for countries used to construct the scale as for countries not used. Moreover, it is associated with the causes (education) and consequences (social mobility) that theory expects it to be. OEP provides a simple, clear and parsimonious indicator of economic advantage that can be meaningfully interpreted.",Sociology

The framework suggests that low-fertility countries already entered and will persist in a fertility equilibrium in the foreseeable future. What distinguishes our theoretical framework from the previous ones is the centrality of women in our model. The woman has a different interest in fertility decisions from others including her male partner. In most human history, her input in fertility decisions was minimal. As the premodern regime begins to crumble, women gradually become aware of other life choices and obtain reproductive autonomy. These changes inevitably lead to falls in fertility. The falls are ultimately driven by the push for broad gender equality and would continue and not be permanently reversed until they meet pronatalistic forces in a below-replacement environment where the antinatalistic and pronatalistic forces balance out into a fertility equilibrium.",Sociology
1669,,"Countries with stronger support to gender equality tend to invest in policies supporting
the dual-earner family model or the earner/carer family model, while countries
with stronger support to conservative gender norms tend to have policies supporting
the male breadwinner family model. However, gender equality norms can be
endorsed by the majority of the population at the national level, whilst conservative
norms could still be largely supported at the sub-national level, potentially leading
to lower uptake of parental leave among fathers in more conservative areas.
This study seeks to examine shifting norms in fathers’ parental leave uptake
in Finnish municipalities in the 2010s, around the first reform that gave fathers
an independent right to a 6-week quota of “solo” parental leave. We applied a
Bayesian spatio-temporal model on administrative data from Finnish municipalities
and estimated local norms based on voting data and content analysis of political
manifestos. Furthermore, we used the proportion of Swedish residents as a proxy
for cross-border policy influences from the neighbouring country Sweden, where
paternal leave-taking has been a longer phenomenon.
Local support to de-familialising policies was found to predict higher leavetaking,
but only before the 2013 reform when fathers’ quota use shortened mothers’
leave. The proportion of Swedish-speaking residents was found to be increasingly
important for predicting paternal leave-taking. We interpret this result as a sign of
cross-border influences from Sweden. Interestingly, uptake increased the fastest in
the most conservative region, probably due to its strong linguistic and cultural links
to Sweden. Furthermore, we observed spatial dependencies between neighbouring
municipalities, which supports our spillover hypothesis; that the interactions among
families nearby lead them to adopt new practices.
These results trigger new theoretical considerations concerning the role of gender
norms in affecting citizens’ behaviour in the family policy field and how these norms
interact with policy reforms, the role of national institutions in affecting welfare state
preferences at the local level, and the importance of community socialisation.",Sociology
1670,,"The severe armed conflict in Ethiopia since November 2020 – the start of an armed insurrection by a party (TPLF) in northern Ethiopia - has been framed and impacted upon by digital offensives and global media reporting in peculiar ways. Representations of the conflict events, actors and victims have had a divisive effect on political debate and cooperation in Ethiopia, thus fuelling communal divisions and preventing compromise. The arena of shared politics in federal Ethiopia was further fragmented, with a notable role played by influential global news media and the ‘social’ media. Their politic rhetoric went beyond strategies of persuasion into forms of partisan intimidation, misinformation, bias and even fiction. 
As with all early 21th-century armed conflicts (cf. the Middle East, Myanmar, or Ukraine), the digital sphere and media manipulation on Ethiopia are shown to be essential domains of discursive battle, extending real life battles, and impacting on international diplomatic responses. The paper analyses some key aspects of the evolving conflict from the perspective of repeated digital ‘memes’ – ‘famine’, ‘genocide’, ‘blockade’, ethnic cleansing’ - and narrative frames – ‘underdog’, ‘self-defense’, ‘peaceful resolution’, ‘truce’ - produced by adherents of one or the other party in the conflict. 
This contemporary (digital) political rhetoric subverts itself and creates a world of semi-fictitious appearances that perpetuate conflict. The problem of addressing ‘Sophist’ arguments is the same as in Plato’s time (cf. Gorgias), but current digital media allow political rhetoric to massively go beyond the conventions of shared discourse. 
Using examples, I argue that, beyond the analysis of the digital and news media products themselves, new ways have to be found to ‘reality-check’ or reduce these products/representations to themes amenable for public discussion and eventual shared compromise (cf. Norris 2017: 630). This might help (re)building political rhetoric in a constructive, and not exclusively polemic, manner.",Sociology

Following the Nordic schema, the Finnish leave system is designed around this concept to encourage leave uptake, but a substantial share of fathers refrain from it. Though there is a substantial body of literature on policy and individual-level motivators of leave uptake, the decision to take leave often occurs in the context of the workplace. Workplace factors are often cited as typical barriers to uptake. We systematically investigated how the most important workplace characteristics are associated with fathers’ parental leave decisions. We used administrative, linked employee-employer Finnish register data and a multilevel Bayesian approach to examine employed first-time fathers’ use of the father’s quota in 2013–2017. Contrary to our expectations, the probability of taking father’s quota did not vary by the gender composition of or gender wage gap within the workplace. Workplace educational level was important, but only for tertiary educated fathers. Increased competitiveness of the workplace lowered the probability of taking the quota. Our findings call for further study on the interplay of individual and contextual factors in fathers’ parental leave uptake.",Sociology

The concept of meritocracy is a central legitimising factor for inequalities in modern societies. As an empirically understood self-description of society, it often proves to be an ideology. However, the corresponding focus of inequality research on illegitimate discrimination that is not based on merit also represents a decisive oversimplification. Equally important are questions about the emergence of performance criteria that are considered legitimate and about the consequences of existing performance differences. The lack of conceptual clarity and heterogeneity make it difficult to empirically diagnose and evaluate meritocratic principles.",Sociology
1673,,"This paper compares processes of labour market entry and early career stages in Britain and West Germany. It starts by looking at the characteristics of the respective institutional structures in which human capital is formed and allocated. The two national systems of formal institutions can be regarded as generating particular modes of co-ordination between education and the labour market, that is that the labour market integration of young people follows different rules in the two countries. A frame of reference is provided by a general model that distinguishes between a horizontal, a vertical and a temporal dimension of the process of integration into the labour market. These dimensions are further pursued in empirical terms: here, major aims of the paper are to assess the effects of formal qualifications on the quality of first jobs and to analyse the multi-dimensional stability of entry positions in early careers. In Britain, co-ordination is, to a larger extent, achieved by criteria of timing, in addition to the hierarchical grading of qualifications; in Germany the latter, as well as substantive occupational skills, play a major role. There have also been important historical changes in these dimensions, especially in the UK.",Sociology

Our findings reveal the following: i) substantial ethnic disparities among drug offenders, but mostly non-existent across other offence categories; ii) area deprivation does not explain away ethnic disparities, but pronounced area disparities are found for breach and assault offences, wherein offenders living in deprived areas are penalised compared to their more affluent counterparts; and iii) ethnicity and area deprivation interact, but only for breach offences, with ethnic minority offenders being treated more harshly than white offenders when residing in deprived areas but favoured when they live in affluent areas.",Sociology
1675,,"As populations age and informal caregiving becomes more widespread, the health consequences of providing care are becoming a key concern for societies. Sociological theories of stress appraisal and role strain posit detrimental consequences to the health and wellbeing of caregivers. Conversely, role enhancement theory holds that caregiving can have positive health consequences. Using data from the English Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSA) collected among adults aged 50 years or older with a follow-up period of up to 20 years (2002-23, N ca. 20,000 persons), we examine associations between transitions into and out of caregiving, and two key health outcomes which have been understudied as consequences of caregiving, namely: allostatic load and cognitive functioning. We estimate asymmetric fixed-effects models which model changes in health outcomes as a function of transitions into and out of caregiving while accounting for unobserved between-person heterogeneity. Our results show that caregiving is associated with better cognitive health for both men and women, but not with improved biomarker-based allostatic load. Results do not differ by caregiving intensity, irrespective of which amount of time is defined as intense caregiving. Our findings provide support for role enhancement theory, suggesting that caregivers benefit in terms of cognitive functioning, even if a biomarker-based approach to measuring stress-related health outcome does not corroborate an overall health benefit. We formulate implications for policy-making and directions for future research.",Sociology

Like any other industry, translation practice was heavily affected by technological advances. Professionals in the translation field use technology like Computer-Aided Translation (CAT) tools to complete their translation tasks. Freelance translators are not exempt from this. This study examines the utilization of CAT tools in the freelance industry in Saudi Arabia. Fulford and Granell-Zafra (2005) have proposed a model that incorporates both information and Communication Technology (ICTs)and CAT tools, facilitating a diverse array of activities such as document creation, information search and retrieval, communication, business management, marketing, procurement, and translation. While CAT tools support document creation, business management, and translation, ICT tools are responsible for the remaining activates . This research aims to thoroughly analyze the characteristics of Saudi freelance translators who use CAT tools, evaluate their usage of CAT tools, and acquire valuable insights into their overall attitudes towards CAT tool. The data was gathered using the survey method and distributed among 98 Saudi freelance translators. The data was analyzed using SPSS descriptive analysis and frequency tables showing percentages of each respondent. The results show that Saudi freelance translators employed general-purpose software like MS Word and MS PowerPoint, whereas less interest was given to special-purpose software which represent CAT tools . The vast majority of the participants agreed on the positive effect of CAT tools.

1680,,"This study applies a discourse analysis framework to explore the portrayal of women in Maysloon Hadi’s novel (The Black Eyes) (2011), using Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) and Norman Fairclough’s tri-dimensional model (1989) as the analytical foundation. It investigates the roles and challenges women face in the novel. While there is growing interest in the portrayal of women in literature, Iraqi literature—especially from the perspective of Iraqi women writers remains underexplored. Hadi’s *The Black Eyes* provides a unique case to examine this intersection. Despite the novel’s rich narrative, which offers insight into Iraqi women’s lives, there is a lack of comprehensive CDA to understand how its language constructs and communicates the multifaceted roles, challenges, and images of women. The research fills this gap by analyzing specific passages from the novel using Fairclough’s model. The findings reveal a nuanced portrayal of women and underscore the value of CDA in analyzing such works. Further research is recommended to apply CDA to other Iraqi literary texts for broader insight",Sociology

The current challenges faced by the construction of the public English teaching faculty in the colleges include improper professional development orientation, unreasonable teacher structure ratios, imbalanced teacher ability development, indistinctive faculty characteristics, and inadequate fulfillment of moral cultivation objective. To address these issues, this study based on the questionnaire survey and cases collected mainly from  higher vocational colleges in Jiangxi’s  province explores repositioning the new professional role of public English teachers under the “New Curriculum Standards” by implementing the working mechanism: “one body (public English teachers), two wings (recruiting &amp; training public English talents), and three parties (government, schools and enterprises) collaboration.” It aims to comprehensively enhance the integrated qualities of “professional knowledge + foreign language skills + cultural literacy” among teachers, thus improving the moral and intellectual nurturing capacity of public English courses in higher vocational education.",Sociology
1682,,"The purpose of this study is to explore the relationship between reading strategies and Bandura’s (1986) theory of Reciprocal Determinism. Previous research acknowledged the concept of Reciprocal Determinism as an effective teaching approach, however, limited research has been done to consider how reading is influenced by learners’ personal factors, behavior and environment.  Based on four Research Questions,  the study explores the perceived use of reading strategies by 225 undergraduates who completed a critical reading course at a local university.  These learners of English as a Second Language responded to an online questionnaire adapted from Mokhtari and Sheorey’s (2002) Survey of Reading Strategies.  Based on the learners’ ratings of the reading strategies, namely Global Reading Strategies, Problem-Solving Strategies and Support Strategies, the findings revealed that there is a significant relationship between the learners’ perceived use of reading strategies and the three factors of Reciprocal Determinism, namely Personal Factors, Behaviour and Environment indicating a cyclical effect that infuences learners’ reading comprehension.  This exploration of reading strategies through this theory has pedagogical implications on how reading is taught to scaffold and help learners increase metacognitive awareness and self-efficacy. Overall, this study contributes to a further understanding of the importance of taking into account the three factors in a reading environment and the relationship between reading strategies and RD.  Future studies could be an extension of how the cyclical effects of Reciprocal Determinism and reading strategies could be strategically integrated into the teaching of skilled and unskilled readers and in other learning domains",Sociology
1683,,"Project-Based Learning (PBL) can potentially enhance learners’ oral proficiency. However, little evidence supports how PBL improves learners’ complexity, accuracy, and fluency, particularly for learners with different proficiency levels. This study examined the changes and linguistic features of varying proficiency learners’ complexity, accuracy, and fluency within a PBL context. It involved a homogeneous group of 45 Chinese college learners, categorized into high (N=15), medium (N=15), and low proficiency learners (N=15). Their oral complexity, accuracy, and fluency were assessed using speaking tests before and after PBL. The changes in their oral performance were evaluated using objective measures of complexity, accuracy, and fluency. The transcripts were also used to analyze the linguistic features of different proficiency learners. The results indicate that PBL significantly enhances syntactic complexity as learners’ proficiency levels increase. Significant differences were observed in lexical complexity, pronunciation accuracy, and self-repairs between high and low-proficiency learners. However, no significant differences were found in syntactic accuracy and speech rate across high, medium, and low proficiency learners. The findings also indicate that different proficiency learners reveal various linguistic features of syntactic complexity, syntactic accuracy, and self-repairs in their oral performance.

Moreover, the study emphasizes the positive attitudes of Gen Z learners toward technology as a flexible and valuable educational resource. The motivation to use technology stems from the desire to learn new vocabulary, comprehend English content, and enjoy flexible learning. Therefore, the study recommends that educators adapt teaching strategies to include these technologies, considering the different proficiency levels of students. Future research should focus on the long-term impacts of technology use on language acquisition.",Sociology

It then applies those variables to interpret tentatively an insurgency from classical antiquity: the Jewish-Roman War of 66–73 A.D. Although the results of one single empirical case cannot be generalised, they nonetheless constitute a preliminary element for the construction of a broader theoretical framework concerning the existence of elements of continuity in the phenomenon of insurgency.",Sociology
1707,,"The Court of Justice frequently redrafts the questions submitted to it by the national courts in the 
context of the preliminary reference procedure. The practice is known as reformulation, and 
oftentimes determines a change to the substance of the question, which is referred to in this article as  substantial reformulation. The Court justifies its use in the need to provide a useful answer to the 
national court. This article empirically investigates how the Court uses the submissions of the parties 
and other materials in the case to substantially reformulate. To do so, it builds a framework of analysis  to observe the possible influence of the parties in the changes to the dispute and the justifications used  by the Court. The analysis relies on a unique dataset of 380 hand-coded preliminary rulings on interpretation.
The findings confirm that substantive reformulation at the Court is frequent and significant. In 
reformulating the dispute, the Court draws on the materials submitted by the parties, and their 
influence can be traced to the questions actually replied to by the Court. Yet, the influence of the 
parties in setting the boundaries of the dispute must not be overstated, as it remains fully within the 
Court’s control when to reformulate and which materials to use to do so. Furthermore, it is difficult 
to identify patterns in the Court’s use of substantial reformulation. Providing a sufficient answer is a 
convenient excuse, but it does not seem to fully explain the findings of the article. The article explores other possible explanations for the increasingly frequent revert to reformulation.",Sociology

the climate crisis and, more specifically, on environmental inequalities. The link
between environmental issues and inequalities is not new, but it is increasingly
being studied, mainly through the prism of working-class neighbourhoods. Indeed,
residents of low-income urban areas are more vulnerable to the consequences
of climate change. And this, even though they contribute to it the least,

Subgroups emerge from actors' membership decisions, with cohesion driven by their preference to co-member with network contacts. A stationary two-mode Stochastic Actor-Oriented Model is specified to obtain the distribution of memberships in subgroups. The model is estimated using the Method of Moments, with target statistics derived from the prior ideas. As a showcase, we model unobserved peer groups in a friendship network. The results indicate that actors form cohesive subgroups of varying composition, characterized by denser overlaps under preference for multiple memberships with network contacts.",Sociology

1711,,"Homelessness has grown in the suburbs of Australian capital cities, with more than 60 per cent of those experiencing homelessness at the 2021 Census found in Australia’s capital cities (up from around 48% in 2001). Homelessness has increased especially in areas with greater shortages of affordable private rental housing (relative to demand from low income households). 

The research, ‘The changing geography of homelessness in Australia (2001–21) and its structural drivers’, undertaken for AHURI by researchers from Swinburne University of Technology, Launch Housing and RMIT University, investigates the changing geography of homelessness in Australia from 2001 to 2021 and the role of structural factors, such as poverty and supplies of affordable rental housing, in shaping this geography. 

Homelessness was also higher in areas with smaller supplies of social housing relative to demand. The research suggests that an increase in social housing will further significantly reduce homelessness.

In areas with a greater shortage of affordable rental dwellings, a higher percentage of Specialist Homelessness Service clients are returning for support after having been assisted. As the majority of people experiencing homelessness tend to remain in the same area, localised responses to homelessness are really important. Homelessness services and affordable housing options need to be expanded in areas where they are needed, and not just where existing services are located.

In order to provide housing to clients who accessed a Specialist Homelessness Service in 2021–22, the research estimated that around 158,000 one- to two-bedroom dwellings and 25,000 three-or-more-bedroom dwellings are needed nationally. These dwellings must be affordable and available to households with the lowest incomes.",Sociology
1712,,"Neuroscience is traditionally considered a branch of biology, with interdisciplinary influences from a wide range of fields including psychology, computer science, engineering and mathematics. As a result, a computational approach to neuroscience has emerged that analyzes human brain activity as the superposition of signals that yield complex rhythms and nonlinear dynamics. The computational approach assumes that normative properties, such as value, meaning and purpose, that are highly relevant to humanity are somehow emergent from these otherwise mechanical interactions. Here, I propose that brain dynamics reflect an organic whole that, in the words of Iain McGilchrist, is “inextricably linked with values, meaning and purpose.” This proposal suggests that brain activity can be investigated as a “kind of music:” a global, emotive form, the shape of which contains nested information regarding vital physiology and embodied emotionality. Using electroencephalography (EEG) as an example, and drawing on the field of musicology, I review historical and recent evidence that reveals how neurodynamics can be seen more like music or an artistic creation: multi-scale, context sensitive, dynamically evolving, and intrinsically meaningful. This “neurodynamics of music” hypothesis is investigated using a geometric framework that includes rhythms and nonlinear dynamics, but where those properties must be understood in the context of the vital metabolism of living organisms. Vital, homeostatic and emotional signals underpin the recurrent play of anticipation and fulfillment in life, brain activity and from which, differentiated meaning is sculpted from the global whole. Neuroscience can benefit from the tools of the humanities informing its analytic methods, theoretical assumptions and interpretive frameworks. Through reengagement with the musical heart of neurodynamics, we may be more inclined to see our brains, our minds, and ourselves, as creatively meaningful, purposeful and alive.",Sociology

As AI becomes increasingly prevalent, use, conflict and development have progressed rapidly, generating a boom in dialogue regarding what a future with AI could potentially look like. I examine discourse on AI in relation to notions of futurity and expertise. While these have been studied qualitatively through analysis of government memos and news media, cutting edge innovation discussed on social media that has not garnered mainstream attention remains understudied. As utilized by cultural sociologists, computational text analysis offers new possibilities in the study of meanings and framings. However, short texts remain understudied due to limitations in existing methods and approaches. I contend that short text limitations can be overcome by focusing on the meaning of sentences as opposed to the meaning of words and I demonstrate the utility of such an approach through two-stage topic modeling in my study of AI, particularly around how notions of futurity and domain-specific expertise are operationalized. This project demonstrates how AI has reshaped notions of expertise with a focus on medicine and ethics amidst new and contested understandings of what a future with AI looks like.",Sociology
1714,,"Despite extensive focus on the rise in midlife mortality in the U.S. in recent years, the implications of this trend for children’s exposure to parental death—or bereavement—remain minimally explored. In this study, we introduce a new approach to estimate trends in children’s exposure to co-resident parental death in the U.S over the past 25 years (1999-2023). Our methodological approach relies on a fusion model and data simulation that joins recent population and mortality data to estimate children’s exposure to co-resident parental death. The results reveal a subtle rise in parental death each year since the early 2010s: in 2023 alone, more than 300,000 children experienced a co-resident parent’s death. The results further demonstrate that the long-running, steady increase in the annual number of parentally bereaved children accumulates to more than 2.4 million children under 18 in 2023 having ever experienced a parent’s death—representing approximately 3.2% of the child population. The results further demonstrate race and ethnic disparities, with non-Hispanic Indigenous children especially at risk of parental death. Together, the results attest to the need for a comprehensive policy response to support parentally bereaved children, and the need for further scholarly recognition of this uniquely consequential childhood adversity.",Sociology

1716,,"This article orbits the promise of Sociology and presents the sociology of promises — or, more precisely, the science of promises, aimed at addressing all sociological curiosities and encompassing all that is sociological. In introducing the General Social Theory of Compromises (G-STOC), a framework designed to overcome the fragmentation of traditional social theories and address their limitations in explaining social behavior, a breakthrough is presented in eight main takeaways that are simultaneously ontological, epistemological and theoretical: (1) social coercive powers derive from actual or virtual agency; (2) virtual agency derives from promises; (3) all anger and disappointment derive from broken promises; (4) promises are always in dynamic reciprocal sets called compromises; (5) compromises are heuristic devices underlying all social relationships; (6) all social phenomena involve compromises; (7) to explain is to describe relationships and (8) sociological explanation, therefore, derives from the description of compromises and their history. The above tenets begin to outline a powerful and coherent framework and their proper appreciation is bound to have a profound impact in Social Science. Avoiding convoluted syntheses of competing theories and emphasizing the social importance of the future as well as theoretical novelty and superior heuristic power, the author advocates for clear conceptual and theoretical grounds to enable a complete and integrated explanation of social phenomena. With this innovative approach, the paper invites scholars to engage critically with G-STOC and explore its potential to unify and enhance the study of the social world, offering new insights about its complexities.",Sociology

By engaging students in independent DiD analyses on a specific research question, in this case related to local governance, the study uncovers a broad range of effect sizes and diverging conclusions reported by the analysts, highlighting the subjective nature of analytical choices and their potential impact on research outcomes. This variability underscores the importance of critical thinking and methodological rigor in social science education. The implications extend beyond pedagogy, suggesting that causal inference methods with significant researcher discretion such as DiD designs benefit from robustness analysis with multiple independent analysts.",Sociology
1718,,"Calorie labeling is a popular policy to address the obesity epidemic, but it has had little empirical success. Under the premise that willful avoidance of information plays a role in this result, we propose a novel approach—pre-nudges—to make consumers more receptive to calorie information. Unlike nudges, which are used to directly influence a choice, pre-nudges are used to directly influence how consumers react to the nudge itself (the calorie label). In line with predictions from our theoretical analysis, we test two pre-nudges in the context of menu labeling: one aims to increase self-efficacy, and the other one highlights the long-term health risks of overeating. In a large-scale laboratory experiment, we find that both pre-nudges reduce calorie information avoidance. Overall, our paper suggests a possible role for pre-nudges in addressing the obesity epidemic—one of the largest public health issues globally—and illustrates the potential usefulness of pre-nudges more generally",Sociology

We compare the performance of LLM-based predictions with traditional machine learning (ML) models, including random forest and XGBoost. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs achieve comparable accuracy to these conventional ML techniques. Additionally, the LLM offers a significant advantage in that it requires no model training, simplifying implementation and reducing computational costs. This makes LLMs a promising, resource-efficient alternative for football match prediction, presenting new opportunities for AI-driven sports analytics.",Sociology

This study investigated occurrences of biodiversity in the lyrics of Japanese popular songs based on monetary estimation, as an exploration of the inspirational value of biodiversity. I analyzed the lyrics of the top 50 songs from the Japanese CD singles chart over 22 years (1999–2020), extracting nouns related to ecosystems and organisms. The extracted words were classified into ecosystems and taxonomic groups, and the total sales amount of songs related to each class was calculated. Statistical analyses compared the occurrences and total sales amounts of songs containing biodiversity. Finally, I investigated the effect of richness of ecosystems and biological organisms within a song on its sales amount, using generalized linear mixed modeling to assess the prevalence of songs inspired by biodiversity. Out of 1,100 songs, 403 songs included references to ecosystems or biological organisms, with plants being the most frequently mentioned. Ecosystems that are familiar to Japanese people and biological organisms which they frequently encounter in their cultural and daily lives contributed to aesthetic inspiration in the lyrics of Japanese popular songs. Most importantly, I indicated that the existence of a single biological organisms within a song lyric can enhance its sales amount, namely prevalence to people. My result implies that the inclusion of a less well-known biological species within a song can indirectly inspire people, increasing recognition and willingness to conserve it.",Sociology
1722,,"This report undertakes an analysis of social policy provision in the six rEUsilience countries from the perspective of resilience and the role of social policy. The analyses are based on a theoretical framework which defines resilience as families’ capacity to adjust to situations of risk without negative outcome and interprets social policy as having both protective functions, such as support available throughout family-based transitions, and promotive functions, such as adequate income support, in affecting the conditions for families to be resilient. The report prioritises the protective aspects. It therefore considers how policy supports transitions for all parents between care and employment and how policy treats three particular types of family situation that the research identifies as needing extra support: parenting alone, caring for a children with a disability or illness, and coping with a migrant background. Consequently, five areas of policy are analysed: parenting-related leaves, early childhood education and care (ECEC), provisions for lone-parent families, provisions for families coping with a disability or illness on the part of a child, and provisions for families with a migration background adjusting or integrating into the new country.

In response to the question of the extent to which the national and EU policy systems support families to be resilient, the analysis highlights a number of important findings. First, some policy fields seem to be better equipped, or further along the road, than others in helping families to be resilient. The policies oriented to transitions - parental leaves and ECEC – generally seem to be better developed then those for family situations with heightened risk. Second, conditions that exclude people from benefits and services reduce policies’ effectiveness (from a resilience as well as other perspectives). Third, where the EU has set legal benchmarks most countries meet them, and so the significance of the EU as a policy agent is confirmed. But where the EU only makes ‘soft recommendations’, they do not seem to penetrate deeply into the national systems. Fourth, the recognition that some families need more has not fully penetrated the policy systems. One big issue is that of equivalence in support for lone-parent families vis-à-vis those with two parents. The dearth of information on and system knowledge about certain types of families, especially those coping with child illness and migrant families, is a general weakness found across countries.",Sociology
1723,,"Social and environmental challenges are combining to form a polycrisis with potential to delay or reset many sustainability efforts. These risks raise questions about what capacities will be needed for advancing sustainability during a time of interlinked crises. Here, we evaluate the adequacy of adaptive and transformative capacities for navigating the polycrisis. Specifically, we perform a rapid assessment of their potential for addressing the 14 recently proposed Anthropocene traps. We find that ten Anthropocene traps have characteristics that challenge in total 17 of 23 adaptive and transformative capacities. On the other hand, 10 of 23 capacities - with an overrepresentation of transformative capacities - have general potential to prevent formation and progress of traps. Coevolutionary struggles between the expression of a capacity and the progression of traps are widespread. Importantly, transformative and adaptive capacities complement each other in the types of Anthropocene traps they most frequently address, with transformative capacities targeting global traps and adaptive capacities the emergent structural traps related to connectivity and pace of change. We end by proposing five unifying processes that can serve as an organizing framework for consideration of other sustainability and crisis capacities.",Sociology
1724,,"Regression discontinuity designs (RDD) and regression kink designs (RKD) are popular identification strategies across the social sciences. The relatively weak assumptions required for identifying a causal effect with RDD/RKDs make the designs attractive quasi-experimental methods for causal inference. One limitation of RDD/RKDs is that they rely on an exogenously given and previously known treatment rule. To overcome this limitation, economists (Porter &amp; Yu 2015, Hansen 2017, Boehnke &amp; Bonaldi 2019, and Tanu 2020) and computer scientists (Herlands et al. 2018) have begun to develop methods and tests that can find unknown discontinuities. However, these tests are either largely theoretically focused, computationally intensive, inconvenient to implement, or otherwise do not fit the specific needs of applied political scientists. Accordingly, this paper presents a novel, more flexible, and extremely easy to implement approach to estimate unknown cut-points in both RDDs and RKDs. It is the first method that can detect unknown thresholds in both RDDs and RKDs. I call this method the unknown cut-point regression discontinuity/kink design (UCRDD/UCRKD). It works by uniformly dividing an assignment variable into quantiles to create a distribution of “candidate” cut-points. Each candidate threshold is then tested in a RDD model (Imbens &amp; Kalyanaraman 2012) to find the “best” cut-point, the cut-point that has the largest substantive effect and highest degree of statistical significance. Researchers can use UCRDD/UCRKD to find “tipping-points” in behavior; to determine obscured or non-public policy criteria; and as a diagnostic tool to determine if there are other significant thresholds in their traditional RDD/RKD. In the application section, I apply UCRKD to assess how to define the concept of a minority district and to estimate the treatment effect of minority districts on electoral support for minority candidates.",Sociology
1725,,"Science communication plays a crucial role in maintaining public trust in science amid complex societal challenges. This study addresses a gap in understanding science communication dynamics by conceptualizing it as a complex adaptive system of actors.

The model encompasses decision-making processes, impact evaluation, and learning mechanisms among actors, distinguishing between institutional and organizational roles across three communica-tion modes: dissemination, dialogue, and participation. By applying the CASSCO model to two scenarios - citizen science and generative AI – the study demonstrates its potential for predicting non-linear dynamics and emergent outcomes in science communication. This approach yields insights into the impact of communication strategies on public trust and contestations of science. The CASSCO model serves as a strategic thinking template, enabling actors to select strategies while considering the behaviors of others.

1729,,"As the concept of polycrisis gains popularity among academics, policy-makers, and the general public, many questions linger about the utility, scope, and applicability of the term in different contexts. Building on prior work, we argue that crises can fruitfully be understood as existing along a spectrum, characterized by multiple different factors, with our modern polycrisis at one extreme. We illustrate this by surveying three historical periods with varying geographical scope – late 1st-millennium CE Mesoamerica, Late Medieval Eurasia, and the early modern Northern Hemisphere – arguing that these exhibited many, but not all, of the key characteristics that make up a polycrisis. We detail the experience of individual societies during these periods, focused on regions to highlight how stresses and dysfunction across multiple systems combined to produce devastating impacts and contrast these with the relatively mild experiences of others facing the same conditions. We highlight how the interaction of stresses across ecological, economic, social, and political systems produced disasters that further deepened these crises and so led to yet more disasters and further devastation. We illustrate how viewing these historical periods through a polycrisis lens can not only inform our understanding of the past but can produce valuable lessons for our modern world. The multi-faceted, far-reaching, and devastating consequences of our current polycrisis should not be viewed as entirely a recent phenomenon. Ultimately, we argue that studying historical polycrises as we do here can help us learn lessons from the past that allow us to hone strategies for addressing the comparable issues we face today and will continue to contend with for the foreseeable future.",Sociology

To systematically understand the presence and sources of such biases, we conducted two studies and compared both. In Study 1, we surveyed crowdworkers on marginalization-related characteristics and analyzed their annotations of racism. In Study 2, we assigned personas to LLMs and studied variations in the annotations. Moreover, we compared human and LLM coder bias from a text-level perspective to account for textual properties driving variation. Our findings suggest that being affected by or aware of marginalization causes systematic variation in human annotations, while persona assignment significantly impacts LLM outputs. Against this backdrop, we advocate for ‘inclusive annotation’ which introduces variance by intentionally integrating coders with lived experience or awareness of the constructs, thereby enriching measurement quality.",Sociology

In this paper, we use a massive dataset of Anglophone fiction (over 23,000 books) and the tools of natural language processing to understand whether the long-term change of topics in books is driven by the individual change of authors or by the cohort turnover in author populations. To answer this question, we borrow a method from evolutionary ecology: decomposition analysis based on the Price equation. To prove the suitability of this method, we first apply it to simulated data and show that it does allow distinguishing between these two processes. Afterwards, we decompose the temporal trajectories of topics and measure the relative effects of the arrival of newcomer authors (entrances), the retirement of authors (exits), and the change of topic preferences during authors’ lifetimes (individual change). We find that cohort turnover is a stronger force than individual change. Within the cohort effects, the effect of entrances is almost twice stronger than the effect of exits. Using simulated data, we discover that this difference stems from the unequal lengths of authors’ careers.",Sociology
1733,,"Background: The conventional formula for calculating food self-sufficiency cannot cover all the food we eat on a daily basis, and the food self-sufficiency ratio (FSSR) of each country cannot be calculated. The conventional food self-sufficiency ratio (CFSSR) can only calculate the FSSRs of each country for grains. To determine the actual state of food insecurity worldwide as accurately as possible, a method for calculating the FSSR of each country for all the foods we eat on a daily basis is needed. To address this situation, this study proposes the supply-side food self-sufficiency ratio (SSFSSR), which can be used to systematically calculate the self-sufficiency ratio of all foods in all countries/regions.

Results: We compared the results of both calculations under the same conditions and used the same data to determine whether the CFSSR or the SSFSSR is a more suitable method for obtaining basic information and formulating measures of global food security. The results showed that the SSFSSR has advantages and practicality over the CFSSR. The SSFSSR can calculate self-sufficiency ratios for all foods in all countries/regions of the world, and the figures for various statistical tests are better. The food that is the subject of the calculation in the SSFSSR formula is the entire supply from production, distribution, storage, and consumption, excluding duplication in the calculation, and includes primary products required to produce secondary products, such as livestock products and edible oils. The study also highlighted the value of reducing the amount of primary products used to produce secondary products such as livestock and edible oils, thereby lowering the primary product conversion rate (PPCR).

Conclusion: This study used actual data to estimate the SSFSSR for each country/region to demonstrate the applicability of this method and that lowering the PPCR would lead to an increase in the food self-sufficiency ratio. To further refine this methodology, we find that the most important tasks for the future are to collect more reliable data on calories per weight for a large number of foods, expand the number of types covered by more reliable PPCRs, and analyze those data.",Sociology
1734,,"Background: Social media platforms like TikTok are pivotal for mental health communication (MHC), providing accessible, trusted content. Despite known benefits of creator training programs in improving content quality, it's uncertain if or how these enhancements affect people who watch that content. This study examines how training programs for TikTok creators influence TikTok users’ mental health knowledge construction and intended behaviors by analyzing user comments on TikTok videos.

Method: We employed LLM-assisted content analysis to annotate TikTok video comments for mental health knowledge construction and behavioral intentions. We then analyzed the impact of a creator training program on users' mental health knowledge construction through within-subject field experiments. Additionally, we extended this method to measure how TikTok's Mental Health Awareness Month (MHAM) in May 2023 affected user mental health knowledge construction and behavioral intentions.

Results: LLM-assisted analysis showed that asynchronous toolkits significantly enhance mental health knowledge construction among video commenters, particularly among creators with high engagement, fewer followers, who are licensed mental health professionals, or  who do not offer paid coaching services. MHAM increased mental health knowledge construction among users, though the audiences of the 7 institutions and 10 content creators that were spotlighted by TikTok during MHAM did not show this effect.

Conclusions: Asynchronous toolkits improve mental health knowledge construction among video viewers. Future training should focus on emerging creators and separate toolkit learning from conference training to enhance training efficacy. In addition, promoting hashtags such as #MentalHealthAwareness can drive meaningful discussions and knowledge construction in video comments, but there is an opportunity for platforms to refine their creator selection criteria to improve on-platform mental health knowledge construction.",Sociology
1735,,"Supply of more housing options for people on social housing waiting lists should be given increased priority, as longer wait times and uncertain or unsafe housing creates further mental health challenges for applicants already facing increased health needs, according to new AHURI research.

The research, ‘The role of housing providers in supporting clients with complex needs’, was undertaken for AHURI by researchers from the University of New South Wales, Swinburne University of Technology and the University of Tasmania. It investigates the current challenges in providing social housing to people with complex support needs and considers potential alternative policy responses. 

Mental health was identified at the centre of many clients’ health needs. Longer social housing wait times and uncertain or unsafe housing was seen as increasing mental health challenges for clients. An increasingly uncertain and expensive rental market was also recognised as exacerbating the issues.

At the simplest service response, connecting people to secure housing helped their mental health. Indeed, social housing providers may be the first and only point of contact that clients with unmet mental health needs have with the service system.

Developing the housing service providers’ workforce could improve the effectiveness of support provided to people with multiple support needs, together with providing individual casework support for with clients to helping people navigate support networks, including ensuring that clients are designated as priority clients on social housing registries.

Using an annotated dataset focused on fungi, particularly those classified as edible or non-edible, we implement a practical application that allows users to upload plant images. The LLM then identifies the species, determines its edibility, and provides detailed information on its characteristics. For edible species, the model offers culinary insights and preparation methods, while also delivering comprehensive educational content on plant ecology and cultural significance. Our approach showcases the ability of LLMs to bridge image recognition with rich, text-based knowledge, facilitating an interactive learning experience that promotes plant literacy and practical understanding. This study highlights the effectiveness of LLMs in educational tools and their potential to enhance public awareness of plant species, including fungi, through visual and contextual data fusion.",Sociology
1737,,"Several historical episodes of Turks during periods of climatic extremes have been examined. In particular, several key dates (536–537, 627, 1259, 1783, and 1884) mark significant periods of anomalous climatic and meteorological upheavals of pan-Eurasian and global importance.
The role of epidemiological factors in political, social, and economic events in the lives of nomadic civilizations has also been highlighted.
The conclusion drawn is that climatic and ecological conditions had a significant influence on the history of the nomadic peoples of the Great Steppe and Kazakhstan.",Sociology
1738,,"Given the global displacement crisis, the integration of refugees has emerged as a critical policy issue for many host countries. A key challenge involves supporting refugees in learning the language of their host country. While several European nations have instituted publicly funded language training for asylum seekers and refugees soon after their arrival, evidence on the efficacy of these early language programs in promoting economic integration remains limited. This study examines the impact of a pioneering, large-scale ad hoc program introduced by German policymakers, which provided basic language training to over 230,000 refugees arriving in 2015-16. Utilizing register data on the population of asylum seekers and exploiting a cutoff date in program eligibility, we assess the program's effectiveness using a regression discontinuity design. Our findings reveal no discernible effect on refugee employment over the subsequent two years. To explore whether language programs are generally ineffective during refugee crises, we contrast these results with the impacts of a more comprehensive, preexisting, yet smaller-scale program. Using a variety of difference-in-differences estimators, we find that this program considerably increased refugee employment. These contrasting findings offer important insights for policymakers on designing effective language training programs for refugees.",Sociology
1739,,"This report shares results from a study of youth philanthropy programs designed to increase community engagement. The study is designed to answer this research question: Does participating in a youth philanthropy program foster positive outcomes for young people? Data are from a youth philanthropy program hosted within 12 community organizations in 7 US states. The program is two years in duration: youth participate as juniors and seniors in high school. Data were collected through surveys with graduating youth who had completed both years of the program (n=180). Findings indicate that the program “works” in fostering engagement in philanthropic activities, gaining prosocial orientations, and having rewarding program experiences. When available, youth outcomes from program participants are compared to national or global data on comparable measures to assess whether youth in this program appear to be participating in philanthropic activities at rates greater than average. Results show that youth participants are high on philanthropic activities and prosocial orientations, and their rates are 30-50% higher than comparable rates. Additionally, youth demonstrate positive growth in targeted philanthropic learning and skills, and youth participants gain a greater network of engaged peers and supportive mentors. The implication is that this youth philanthropy program is successful in fostering positive youth development.",Sociology
1740,,"We examine the extent and mechanisms by which race affects the college admissions process. We provide evidence from a field experiment where fictitious applicants request application fee waivers from all university admissions counselors in the United States. White applicants are much more likely to receive a waiver, be informed that the application is free, or receive a request for more information than Black or Asian applicants. Our results contrast sharply with previous evidence from acceptance decisions showing bias in favor of Black applicants. We introduce a model of university pricing and use information from counselors' LinkedIn and university profiles, along with university characteristics, to test predictions. We find evidence consistent with agent-taste-based discrimination, where biases stem from counselors' preferences, and profit-maximizing statistical discrimination. Discrimination in university admissions can vary substantially based on the context in which decisions are made.",Sociology
1741,,"Purpose: This study examines whether kindergarten-level Urdu phonological processing predicts the future Grade 1 English word and non-word reading accuracy skills of Urdu-English bilinguals in (i) Pakistan, with an Urdu as a national/societal-language country context, and (ii) Canada, with an Urdu as a heritage-language country context. Method: At Timepoint 1 of this longitudinal study, we assessed 154 Urdu-English kindergarten-aged bilinguals in Pakistan (n = 104) and Canada (n = 50) on their Urdu phonological awareness and rapid automatized naming (RAN) skills, via the Urdu Phonological Tele-Assessment Tool (U-PASS). After 1 year at Timepoint 2, we tested their English word and non-word reading accuracy skills at the Grade 1 level. Result: Our hierarchical linear regressions consistently demonstrated cross-language transfer between Urdu phonological awareness and the English word and non-word reading accuracy measures in both Pakistan and Canada. Predictive strength differences were demonstrated between RAN and reading outcomes, based on country-specific contexts. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that languages learnt in both a societal or heritage context (i.e., Urdu) contribute to early reading skills in another language (i.e., English), thereby emphasizing the importance of overall cross-language knowledge at the early stages of learning to read. This study also emphasizes the role of cross-language transfer for facilitating equitable access to early assessment for bilingual populations: Urdu phonological processing skills can be used to identify bilingual children’s future English reading abilities, rather than waiting until the child demonstrates adequate English language proficiency for completing traditional English phonological processing assessments.",Sociology
1742,,"Environmental performance indices play a crucial role in evaluating countries' environmental efforts and advancing global environmental governance. This study critically examines disparities among prominent climate performance indices, including the Environmental Performance Index (EPI), Climate Change Performance Index (CCPI), and Climate Action Tracker (CAT). We reveal significant divergences in country rankings, particularly between ‘developed’ and ‘least developed’ nations, underscoring how methodological choices profoundly impact outcomes and interpretability. We develop an analytic tool, called EPI-equity, to demonstrate how integrating equity principles can substantially alter performance assessments. We propose a conceptual framework to classify indices based on the perspectives they embody, highlighting how these can shape the interpretation of performance. Our results suggest that the outcomes of environmental performance indices are more likely to concur when they represent similar perspectives. We propose that explicitly articulating the perspective implied by the formalism of performance indices can enhance transparency, guide developers in aligning methodological choices with intended interpretations, and equip users with a clearer understanding of the results. Our analysis highlights the importance of employing multiple indices that encompass a range of perspectives for a comprehensive evaluation of countries' environmental performance. Our adaptable framework provides a structured approach to guide the selection of indices ensuring that they span a broad spectrum of viewpoints. This method mitigates the likelihood of conflicts arising from fragmented worldviews on complex socio-environmental issues.",Sociology
1743,,"Workplace surveillance is a common occurrence in many traditional workplaces and excessive forms can lead to resistance efforts from employees. However, most of the literature on this topic has been focused on the traditional office worker. There is now a new evolutionary worker that goes against social norms by travelling around the world while working remotely, the Digital Nomad. Therefore, this article aims to incorporate Digital Nomads into workplace surveillance research. This resulted in the research question “How does the Digital Nomad lifestyle interact with workplace surveillance and resistance acts”. To answer this, 5 semi-structured interviews were conducted on Digital Nomads recruited from social media platforms. Interview transcripts were analysed using thematic data analysis where 3 main themes were identified: Shift from Traditional Restraints, Perks of Elite Workers, Panopticon’s Future. Overall, Digital Nomads did not experience intensive surveillance and findings supported the idea that they are productive, elite workers, opting to work for employers that do not monitor their employees. It was also found that Digital Nomads take part in minor acts of resistance, but they were not actively resisting their employers. These results suggest the need for future researchers to further expand upon the status of the Digital Nomad worker and explore their experiences of workplace surveillance and resistance.",Sociology
1744,,"Children from well-resourced families achieve, on average, higher grades and gain more qualifications than those from under-resourced families. Mothers' speech is likely a key driver of the transmission of family background inequality in education. Yet, long-term associations between mothers' speech and children's education-related outcomes beyond the early years have not been studied previously. Here, we quantified differences in mothers' vocabulary sophistication, lexical diversity, and grammatical complexity from 10-minute-long naturalistic speech samples audio-recorded when children were age 5 and starting formal education. Children completed measures of cognition at age 5 and measures of literacy at ages 7 and 10 years; teachers rated their educational achievement at ages 7, 10, and 12 years. Data came from E-Risk, a UK cohort study that recruited families with twins born in 1994 and 1995 who represented the full range of Britain's socioeconomic conditions (analytic sample N = 894 mother-child trios). Mothers' vocabulary sophistication significantly predicted children's cognition, literacy, and educational achievement between the ages of 5 and 12 years, accounting for 2% to 5% of the variance. These estimates were reduced to 1% and 2% or became altogether non-significant after adjusting for mothers' educational attainment and household income. Our findings suggest that mothers' speech plays a small independent role in the long-term transmission of family background inequality in education.",Sociology

Based on our experiences as health advocates for a patient experiencing pain, the attempts made to address their pain, and the barriers encountered, we submit questions for future research. The first question is how can a patient’s pain be adequately treated given the hesitation of doctors to prescribe pain medication due to the opioid crisis? The second question asks if a nurse should be able to deny a patient pain medication prescribed by a doctor? The third question considers if clear communication between the patient, family, nurses, and doctors is really sought or do some actors find the deniability provided by communication barriers advantageous? Context is provided as to how these questions were formulated.",Sociology
1746,,"Narrative engagement offers substantial psychosocial benefits, including cognitive health, emotional and social well-being, and longevity. However, vision loss in older adults can pose challenges in accessing printed narratives. As individuals may shift from print to auditory narratives due to age-related vision loss, understanding how this transition affects narrative engagement becomes crucial. The current work provides a synthesis of the intersection of aging, vision loss, and narrative engagement, focusing on cognitive, emotional, and sensory changes. We discuss how age and vision loss may modify critical components of story engagement, potentially altering narrative consumption and experience. Our research highlights the need to adapt research methodologies and measurement scales to suit older adults and auditory narratives, ensuring they capture unique aspects of auditory engagement and account for sensory impairments. We propose novel directions for studying narrative engagement and offer insights for future research to provide inclusive and accessible narrative forms that support the cognitive and emotional well-being of older adults.",Sociology
1747,,"Research on the impact of elections on attitudes toward democracy has focused
primarily on satisfaction with democracy. Building on this, we analyze how win-
ning and losing elections, along with affective polarization, shapes citizens’ support
for norms of democratic restraint and consent. We propose that partisan animus
weakens the “reservoir of goodwill” that helps citizens accept democratic norms of
restraint and consent that may go against their self-interest. However, a compara-
tive study of 36 elections and two quasi-experimental case studies show that win-
ners and losers do not differ significantly in their support for these key democratic
norms. Even in highly polarized contexts, winners’ restraint and losers’ consent
remain relatively robust. While satisfaction with democracy is shaped by winner-
loser dynamics, especially when polarization is high, support for core democratic
principles is not, despite increased partisan hostility. These findings have positive
implications for our understanding of the role of citizens in democratic processes.",Sociology
1748,,"This study examines the connections between narratives in video game genres, particularly action RPGs, and the processes of appropriation and circulation among communities, analyzing in deept. the interaction dynamics between the lore narratives of ""The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim"" and information shared inside Reddit forums. The study suggests that the Norse mythology in the video game Skyrim does not directly correlate with contemporary social conflicts. Instead, it suggests that socially relevant themes and ideologies may be attracted to different channels, such as less specific spaces. This aligns with the echo chamber model, where different themes correspond to different communicative and performative spaces. The Norse mythology serves as an open narrative infrastructure for the game's designers and players, supporting the construction of the possible world of the lore. However, the study does not show direct contamination effects on communities, suggesting that the lore may indirectly produce ideology on socially relevant issues.",Sociology

1750,,"Background: In 2022, a nationally representative longitudinal survey in the USA found concerningly high prevalences of support for and personal willingness to engage in political violence, but those prevalences decreased in 2023. This study examines changes in those prevalences from 2023 to 2024, an election year in the USA.

Methods: Participants were members of Ipsos KnowledgePanel. Wave 3 of the survey was conducted May 23-June 14, 2024; invitations to participate were sent to all respondents to prior waves who remained in KnowledgePanel. Outcomes are expressed as weighted proportions. Year-to-year change is based on the means of aggregated individual change scores, which have a potential range from 0 (no change) to ±2. 

Results: The 2024 completion rates were 88.4% (8896 respondents/10,064 invitees) overall, 91.6% (8185 respondents/8932 invitees) for invitees in 2024 who had responded in 2023, and 62.8% (711 respondents/1132 invitees) for invitees in 2024 who had responded in 2022 but not in 2023. After weighting, 50.9% (95% confidence interval (CI) 49.5%, 52.3%) were female; weighted mean (SD) age was 48.5 (24.9) years. From 2023 to 2024, the prevalence of the view that violence was usually or always justified to advance at least 1 political objective did not change (2024: 26.2%, 95% CI 25.0%, 27.5%; 2023: 25.3%, 95% CI 24.1%, 26.5%). There were no changes from 2023 to 2024 in willingness to damage property, threaten a person, injure a person, or kill a person in an act of political violence, and no changes in expectations of firearm use in situations where respondents considered political violence justifiable. Changes on other measures were infrequent (17 of 58 comparisons in the main analysis) and small where they occurred (with 2 exceptions, change &lt; 0.05). 

Conclusions: Contrary to expectation, support for and willingness to participate in political violence in this cohort showed little to no change from 2023 to 2024, an election year in the USA. These findings can help guide prevention efforts.",Sociology

However, little is known about what novel challenges and opportunities face economic development programs and practitioners in attempting to advance equity.  This paper reports results from a workshop engaging 48 managers and staff working on components of the Georgia Artificial Intelligence Manufacturing Project (Georgia AIM), a $65 million equity-focused regional economic development project funded by the U.S. Economic Development Administration and the Georgia state government.  Participants discussed their understandings of economic participation and equity, potential obstacles and opportunities in achieving equity, and approaches to assessing equity outcomes.  Results reveal diversity in understandings of equity in the manufacturing economy.  Participants agree that widespread participation in manufacturing work partly constitutes manufacturing equity, but they exhibit more divergence about social, psychological, or environmental aspects of participation and equity.  Meanwhile, participants identified a wide variety of both internal and external factors which will affect whether Georgia AIM achieves its equity goals.  This report illustrates several tensions which equity-focused economic development projects will have to face—between promoting all or only some sorts of manufacturing jobs; between promoting benefits from manufacturing and reducing harms from manufacturing; and between achieving and assessing impact.  Participants’ grounded perspectives on negotiating these tensions can provide guidance for future economic development projects.",Sociology

However, common methods treat words and phrases in isolation, ignoring the relational dynamics where meaning is embedded in the interaction between phrases and their textual environment. Recent transformer- based language models overcome such limitations, but are rarely used in published political science articles, possibly due to misconceptions about their data and computational requirements. To bridge this gap, this article explains the pretrain- finetune paradigm for transformer-based language models and its potential to improve text analysis in political science by harnessing robust models trained on extensive datasets while requiring relatively small amounts of labeled data and computational resources from researchers. To demonstrate its effectiveness, I employ the approach to identify toxic language in conversation threads following U.S. Senators’ tweets.",Sociology

To address this simple but oft-neglected reality, I propose the concept of claimability, defined as the appropriateness of making a claim. Focusing on three international norms that emerged after the world wars (territorial integrity, self-determination, and maritime sovereignty), I construct a new dataset of states’ claimable areas from 1946 to 2024. I illustrate the usefulness of this concept by applying it to oil and conflict. By leveraging the records of over 600,000 wildcat drills, natural experiments, and difference-in-differences, I demonstrate that fuel resources increase interstate conflicts only when discovered in areas claimable to multiple states. The extensive analyses of validity, heterogeneity, and mechanisms, as well as the “most-similar” case study, provide further evidence. These findings reveal the crucial role of claimability; states claim and dispute only when international norms permit such actions.",Sociology
1756,,"Utilizing Large Language Models (LLM), this study investigates the evolution of an innovative social security policy idea, the General Benefit concept into a policy reform proposal in Fin-land from 2007 to 2023. Drawing from the ideational analysis we hypothesize that political parties struggled over social security conditionality during the 2010s and that social security simplification was manipulated differently in relation to conditionality. Our primary data is elec-tion manifestos and governmental programs from 2007-2023. We employed LLMs, mainly a customized ChatGPT, for the text analysis of policy documents. Additionally, we conduct a critical human evaluation of the LLMs analysis and publish our model in the GPT store for the open replication of analyses. 

Findings indicate that the weakening of the tripartite industrial relations system and the break-ing of “status quo of three big parties” allowed new parties to influence social policy in 2010s. The General Benefit emerged as a response to calls for social security simplification and for countering (unconditional) basic income proposals. Adopted in 2023, the General Benefit concept aims to merge Finnish universal / residence-based social insurance benefits for the working-aged while preserving core principles like social risk categories and conditionality. Despite increased nativism from the rising True Finns party, and the adoption of universal / unconditional basic income by several parties, Finnish social policy trends from 2007 to 2023 continued to emphasize employment and public finance sustainability.

Our study also contributes to methodological discussions on using LLMs in policy analysis. The “human evaluation”, performed by the authors, confirms that the LLM analysis accurately summarises the main features of the policy evolution. However, we also found that the LLM lacks ability to recognise the nuances of “multidimensional” political language and is not very helpful in cross-sectional evaluation, which leaves the analysis partly shallow. Thus, we con-clude that in qualitative policy analysis, LLMs in their current form are suitable for comple-menting rather than substituting human evaluation.",Sociology

Using family reconstitution data for the province of Zeeland (LINKS) containing over 200.000 children born 1835-1914, I show that mortality was higher among children under age 5 whose parents lost siblings before age 5. This intergenerational persistence of child mortality existed independently from socioeconomic differences in child mortality. Inequalities accumulated, as child mortality was highest for low-SES children whose parents originated from high-mortality, low-socioeconomic status families. Intergenerational transmission in child mortality persisted even when child mortality had declined in the early 20th century.",Sociology

1759,,"Autoethnography is a methodological approach which seeks to provide depth of experience and understanding of a phenomena through the researcher’s analysis of their own personal experience. As a veterinary researcher with a focus on different methodologies, I elected to apply the autoethnographic approach to my experiences adopting my cat, Athena, from a shelter in 2014. I knew I had experienced feelings of regret and considered relinquishing Athena in the immediate post-adoption period, and I was interested in using this as a case study into the formation of a successful human companion-animal relationship. Through my analysis of my own experiences, I have three main reflections which may be able to aid the veterinary and shelter industries in supporting successful adoptions. First, the highly individual nature of each individual companion animal relationship must be recognised and supported, with veterinary and shelter advice being tailored to the specific needs of the owner and animal. Second, the transition to pet owner requires more active and realistic management, without following a ‘recipe’ for a perfect owner and pet relationship. Finally, I reflect on how my own mental health impacted the process of adoption in light of research surrounding the beneficial impacts of companion animals on pets. Overall, I found the autoethnographic process to be a challenging, but useful lens onto the phenomenon of pet relinquishment, and highlight some considerations for its use in veterinary research.",Sociology

There is strong evidence that climate activism shifts public opinion and media coverage in a pro-climate direction, but this varies by context and the tactics employed. There is more moderate evidence that activism can pressure policymakers to communicate more about climate change, encourage voters to vote in a more pro-climate direction, and financially pressure carbon intensive companies. We review suggestive evidence that protest can influence emissions and environmental policy. Although these studies cover a wide swath of outcome variables, a majority examine intermediate variables, rather than long term impacts. Generalizability is challenged by a bias towards the U.S. and Western Europe. We call for greater focus outside those geographic areas and more attention to activism's impact on public policy and emissions.",Sociology

Many of these challenges are shared with social learning, but it also helps highlight the circumstances under which social learning is particularly valuable. We then turn to the specific inferential challenges that must be addressed by cognitive mechanisms for social learning.

1763,,"Citizens are expected to hold corrupt politicians accountable. However, while observational studies and field experiments often find corrupt politicians re-elected, survey experiments show that citizens are unlikely to vote for corrupt candidates. This contradiction may arise because previous studies have not accounted for how citizens navigate political information in the real world. In this paper, we propose a model of corruption accountability that considers how citizens selectively engage with political information. We test this model using a PICA experimental design fielded in Spain. The results indicate that information selection can explain the limited consequences of corruption scandals, as not all citizens expose themselves to corruption information, and their likelihood to hold corrupt politicians accountable depends on their information preferences. These findings suggest corruption accountability may be increased not by informing those who select out of counter-attitudinal information, but by reaching inattentive citizens generally not exposed to political information.",Sociology

This study investigates the drivers behind illegal dumping, with a focus on rural and urban communities in Ontario. Using a mixed-methods approach, including household surveys and interviews, we examine self-reported instances of dumping, attitudes towards waste management, and perceived barriers to legal waste disposal. The results reveal that inadequate waste collection infrastructure, particularly in rural areas, and high disposal costs are primary motivators for illegal dumping. Additionally, a lack of awareness regarding proper disposal methods exacerbates the issue. While most respondents recognize the immorality of illegal dumping, rural participants show less guilt and are more likely to engage in the behavior. The study provides actionable insights for policymakers, including the need for improved waste infrastructure, targeted educational campaigns, and increased enforcement efforts. By addressing these key factors, Ontario can mitigate the environmental and public health risks posed by illegal dumping, while fostering a culture of responsible waste disposal.",Sociology

1766,,"Exposure to environmental burdens, such air and noise pollution or the lack of available green spaces, has been linked to a multitude of detrimental outcomes. Previous evidence indicates that poor residents and foreign minorities in European cities are disproportionately exposed to environmental burdens. However, there are substantial but ill-understood differences between European countries and between cities within countries. To address this limitation, we utilise fine-grained 1km-by-1km neighbourhood grid data on objective air and noise pollution as well as green space availability, enriched with administrative data on poverty rates and foreign minority shares from all German cities with at least 100,000 inhabitants in 2017. We examine whether poor residents and foreign minorities are more often affected by environmental burdens, how their exposure to environmental burdens differs between cities, and what city-specific contextual factors contribute to these between-city differences. We find evidence that foreign minorities are more likely to be exposed to environmental burdens, but poor residents are predominantly not. However, there is considerable variation between cities. The strongest explanatory factor for this variation is the extent to which disadvantaged groups live in central neighbourhoods, less so residential segregation of poor and foreign residents, or the scarcity of ‘clean and healthy’ neighbourhoods in a city. Against these results, we further explore empirically how the current wave of inner-city gentrification might ease environmental inequality in German cities.",Sociology
1767,,"Studies of public reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war have renewed interest in the rally-round-the-flag phenomenon of public opinion. At the same time, another group of studies has focused on political polarization and the strengthening of radical right parties in many countries. The current study synthesizes these two lines of research by exploring how public opinion in deeply polarized countries changes in response to violent international conflicts that, in a less polarized context, would likely have led most citizens to close ranks behind the government and its war policy. We analyzed original panel data collected in Israel before and after the October 7 massacre and during Israel’s retaliation in Gaza. The findings reveal a “segmented rally,” in which the vast majority of Jewish Israelis supported the war and trusted the security forces, but trust in the government and the prime minister was more limited. In addition, the analysis identified two distinct sets of mechanisms driving opinion formation. Support for the war and security forces was motivated by feelings of threat, humiliation, and rage. In contrast, respondents’ trust or mistrust of the government and the prime minister hinged on what they viewed as the cause of the security crisis—the government or anti-government protesters—an assessment driven by their preexisting views on the government’s “judicial reform” initiative. The paper concludes by discussing the mutual impacts of polarization and public reactions to crises.",Sociology
1768,,"This study examines the divergent development of the platform-based food delivery sector in Germany, focusing on why the ideal-typical gig economy model based on self-employed couriers has not taken hold. Unlike other countries, Germany stands out as an exceptional case where large food delivery platforms classify their workers as employees, providing them with rights and benefits such as minimum wage, paid vacation, and sick leave. The study uses a historical-sociological case study approach to reconstruct the development of the sector and the decision-making processes that have influenced this development. Drawing on historical institutionalism, the analysis examines different heuristics for divergent paths: self-reinforcing path dependence, self-induced reactive sequences, critical junctures, mindful path creation, and transformative incremental change. The study finds that early market shaping by the pioneering company Bringdienst.de (later called Pizza.de), which focused on equipping restaurants to deliver online orders without taking responsibility for the delivery itself, significantly influenced the market environment. In addition, a court ruling in 2020 has increased the risk perception of bogus self-employment among platforms, leading to the abandonment of the gig worker model with self-employed couriers. The study concludes that the critical juncture heuristic, combined with a shadow of the past effect of market constitution, best explains the unique development in Germany.",Sociology
1769,,"This study conducts an epistemic and exegetical analysis of the early writings of the young Søren Kierkegaard, situating them within the intellectual context of Denmark's Golden Age (1834-1841). During this period, Denmark experienced a cultural revival marked by the widespread influence of German philosophical thought, especially the ideas of Kant, Hegel, and the Romantics. The central objective of this research is to explore how the discussions on Romantic irony, subjectivism, and the cultural crisis shaped Kierkegaard's philosophical development. The analysis focuses on the main intellectual figures of the era, such as Johan Ludvig Heiberg, Hans Lassen Martensen, and Poul Martin Møller, and how their contributions influenced Kierkegaard's formative years. This work challenges the traditional view that isolates Kierkegaard from his contemporaries, proposing instead that he actively engaged with and responded to the ongoing debates of his time. By contextualizing his work within the broader cultural transformations of Denmark's Golden Age, the study aims to illuminate Kierkegaard's early philosophical positions and the origins of his concept of irony.",Sociology
1770,,"Human behavioral ecology is an evolutionary framework that attempts to understand how adaptive human behavior maps on to variation in social, cultural, and ecological environments. It emerged as a coherent framework in the United States and the U.K. in the 1980s and has flourished as an explanatory framework ever since. The concentration of HBE scholarship in English-speaking countries has led to missed opportunities to engage other partners in testing and expanding human behavioral ecological models of human behavioral and life history variation. In this review, we describe opportunities for broader human behavioral ecology-driven scholarship in the Chinese context. We introduce human behavioral ecology holistically, including its history, methodological frameworks, pet topics, recent integration with related fields, with a special emphasis on its recent integration with Chinese social, archaeological, and life sciences scholarship. We address potential criticisms of human behavioral ecology and how to ensure a robust and careful application of human behavioral ecology principles in the study of human behavior in China, past and present. We conclude with excitement as the remarkable variation in the Chinese behavioral landscape offers unparalleled opportunities for innovative and integrative studies.",Sociology
1771,,"The report ""Best Practices in Organics Diversion in Multi-Residential Buildings"" provides a comprehensive review of strategies to improve organic waste diversion in high-density living environments such as apartment complexes and condominiums. The report identifies key challenges, including space constraints, resident education, and infrastructure limitations, which hinder efficient waste separation. Through a detailed analysis, it presents best practices in education, infrastructure, community engagement, and policy frameworks.

Key recommendations emphasize the importance of resident education through workshops, clear signage, and the distribution of welcome kits. The report also advocates for infrastructure improvements, such as convenient bin placements, appropriate bin sizes, and space optimization. Additionally, community engagement is highlighted, with the formation of resident committees and the use of recognition and reward programs as effective methods to increase participation.",Sociology
1772,,"In today’s world of information overload, people need skills to quickly and critically evaluate online content; they must be able to consider the credibility and quality of information as well as recognize fake and misleading information. Here, we operationalize critical thinking skills into 6 measurable concepts (i.e., causation and correlation, independent data and replicates, reproducibility, credibility of sources, experimental control, and significance), and we explore whether teaching these 6 concepts enhances scientific literacy and/or resilience against fakeness (fake tweets) and misinformation. Mixed results from our study reveal that: 1) in a small group game on misinformation, critical thinking training significantly improves accuracy and speed in assessing the truthfulness of scientific information online; 2) in a large, preregistered, randomized trial, understanding and application of critical thinking skills concepts strongly correlates with participants’ ability to identify fake tweets and misinformation; however, critical thinking training with recorded videos does not enhance participants’ proficiency in detecting fakeness and misinformation. There is a need to develop innovative interventions to prepare people to respond to misinformation, which is fast-evolving. Tools to support misinformation-specific critical thinking skills have been largely unexplored, and we anticipate such tools might be a valuable contribution to help the public navigate infodemics.",Sociology
1773,,"There is a growing need to maximise the social benefits achieved from public investment in infrastructure, particularly with the transition to net zero economies. Project Delivery Models (PDMs)—the contractual agreements that set out roles and responsibilities for infrastructure project partners—can underpin the delivery of social benefits, yet the processes involving their selection are largely opaque. In this paper we explore how social considerations inform PDM selection and how this is facilitated by policy. We interviewed highly experienced procurement professionals from the sector about how social benefits and risks are considered. We also examined how the associated regulatory environment supports social considerations through documentary analysis of auditing guidance documents. We found that not only are social benefits sidelined in early project decisions, but social risks are inadequately considered. An entrenched gap in social expertise contributes to this situation while project compartmentalisation presents challenges for inclusion and transparency in decision-making. Current auditing processes provide little incentive for social benefit consideration and reinforce both risk framing and compartmentalisation of major infrastructure projects. The paper offers new and important insights into this early project stage and distils five recommendations for improving social benefit creation from infrastructure investments, particularly in developed economies.",Sociology
1774,,"Recovery efforts of existing South Korean watchtower sites have been conducted as part of local tourism efforts and have contributed to public interest in the conservation and study of said sites. An additional 21 sites have been excavated in 2023, deemed important enough for reconstruction efforts (Yang, 2023). However, while significant research exists on the archeological sites themselves, there is scarcely any public recognition of the soldiers that manned the stations and their subsequent socioeconomic standing. Popular culture has abbreviated depictions of Joseon-dynasty watchtowers to a similar level: (significant for) “an extensive communications network to deliver information about enemy forces, that also employed horseback riders as an emergency backup” (Ntl. Institute of Kor. History, 2024).  I argue this depiction is overly generic and implies equivalence to Eurocentric watchtower practices, ignoring the cultural nuances that made the position of the average Joseon-dynasty watchman significantly challenging and fundamentally divergent from then-contemporary watchmen in European countries. This paper subsequently attempts to discern and critically evaluate the sociocultural status of soldiers stationed at Joseon watchtowers (Bonghwa), comparing them against European watchtowers and their socioeconomic conditions. Specific sites include Caernarfon Castle and Cheonlim Bonghwa Watchtower at the site of Cheonlim Mountain, the latter of which has been accompanied by more thorough artifact and observational fieldwork analysis. Recovered artifacts include living quarters, barriers, and tools. Further literature analysis was conducted to discern the socioeconomic standing and practices of Bonghwa watchmen in context of mid-century Joseon dynasty caste systems. In combining fieldwork and sociocultural analysis, I develop a multidimensional account of Joseon watchmen and prove that the soldiers assigned to Joseon watchtowers, Bonghwa, are representative of an underrepresented social dynamic, as well as providing insights into the philosophical and theological differences between the Western sphere through material conditions.",Sociology
1775,,"In examining Italy's low fertility rates, recent studies emphasize the role played by socio-economic factors, uncertainty, and welfare state. However, emerging research highlights a potential downward revision of fertility ideals among younger generations. Our study analyses fertility desires, expectations, and the perceived value of having children among young adults in Italy from 2012 to 2022. Findings reveal a growing tendency of being childfree and not expecting to have children in life. In particular, they indicate a nuanced demographic gradient: we observe a decline in fertility desires and expectations with age, and a significant increase in the likelihood of not desiring children for women. Educational background, which was positively associated with fertility desires at the beginning of the observational period, in post-pandemic shows a negative or null relationship. Our study highlights the need for robust, harmonized cross-country surveys to better understand new fertility ideals across different socio-demographic contexts.",Sociology
1776,,"How does climate science challenge interpretations of ‘the weather’? British heatwaves are traditionally considered a fortunate break from dull routine. A topic-modeling analysis of British national newspaper articles on heatwaves from 1985 until 2023 (N = 35,127) shows this longstanding Romantic understanding has largely disappeared; today, Apocalypticism is by far the dominant genre for conceiving them. A supplementary hermeneutic analysis then indicates complexity within this broad trend. 1980s stories already noted routine heatwave problems, while many recent ones continue depicting positive evaluations of leisure and consumption opportunities. Within the Apocalyptic genre itself climate change is today deemed a factual causal force, whereas in the 1980s and 1990s it was a possible carrier of future dangers. The approach used here is novel, replicable, focused and non-reactive and can be transposed to other national contexts.",Sociology

This article presents an indepth, microscale analysis of one such site, Monte Vairano in Samnium, drawing on perspectives from comparative urbanism. Monte Vairano developed urban characteristics such as a complex socioeconomic profile and political cohesion, as well as potentially more unique features such as an apparently balanced distribution of wealth. These results can shed further light on the diversity of ancient urbanization and its sociopolitical implications in late-first millennium BC Italy and the Mediterranean.",Sociology

1779,,"Conflict forecasting has seen two recent developments: a shift to predicting continuous variables and a debate about the value of structural and procedural variables. This paper contributes to these efforts and proposes the category of salience variables in the form of Google Trends and Wikipedia data. Internet searches can be precursors of conflict intensity as a result of e.g. an increase in protests, violent behavior, or public announcements. Data are readily and openly available, updated in real time, and provide global coverage which makes it ideal for near-real time forecasting. Prediction targets are the number of security-related incidents and battle-related, non-state, and civilian casualties. I demonstrate the value of salience variables using various out-of-sample windows and performance metrics on the country- and province-month level. I find evidence that salience variables have considerable predictive power, outperform other commonly used variables, and are thus a valuable addition to the conflict forecasting toolkit.",Sociology
1780,,"A fundamental concern in studying social inequalities is understanding how socioeconomic advantages and disadvantages are passed down from generation to generation. However, previous studies have not adequately distinguished between the contributions of genetic and environmental factors to socioeconomic disadvantage. In this paper, we use Finnish register data on twins born from 1975 to 1986, considering a total of 7,628 pairs, to analyze how genetic and environmental factors are associated with dropout from secondary education, unemployment, and the receipt of social assistance during early adulthood. The results of the twin design show that not only environmental but also genetic factors play a role in all measured socioeconomic disadvantage outcomes. For school dropout and, particularly, unemployment, genetic components explain more than shared environment. Conversely, for the receipt of social assistance, the shared environment component is larger than the genetic component. This result indicates that living in impoverished economic conditions is more dependent on factors related to social resources than those related to genetic inheritance. Of all the measured indicators, the unique environment is the most important, indicating the influence of stochastic life events regarding socioeconomically disadvantageous outcomes.",Sociology

However, current research on mitigating misinformation is fragmented across disciplines, highlighting the need for an integrated framework. We present the Socio-Ecological Responses to Misinformation (SERM) framework, which outlines the key actors and interventions needed to effectively combat misinformation in democratic systems. The framework proposes a three-tiered approach that includes interventions at the policy level (e.g., transparency regulations), the organizational level (e.g., educational programs in schools), and the social level (e.g., peer correction). These interventions target either the platform (e.g., transparency reporting) or the users (e.g., literacy). Ultimately, the interventions collectively reshape the information environment by supporting accurate information and reducing the amount of misinformation.",Sociology
1782,,"This chapter provides an ethnographic account of how content creators present cancer cures on TikTok. It assesses the quality of cancer cure videos algorithmically recommended by TikTok, the radicalization pathways afforded by short video platforms like TikTok and their potential to cause online harms. Content creators commonly feature contrarian doctors and draw on a conspiratorial worldview to present various miracle cures as intentionally concealed and stigmatized by the establishment. This framing gives credence to creators’ claims and the cures they promote. It also presents TikTok as a more reliable platform from which to access health information censored by the mainstream. Since TikTok is used as a search engine by younger demographics, it becomes a key means of accessing health information. Using TikTok to access health information poses significant risks: First, the technological affordances of TikTok render the app susceptible to radicalizing users. While radicalization is not technologically determined by simply viewing content, radicalization can occur through the endless scroll of conspiratorial content algorithmically recommended to users searching for cancer cures on the platform through a gradual process of socialization. Second, short form videos can become a gateway to radical views because these videos commonly direct users to personal bios, websites and ecommerce stores. Third, radicalization and online harms can be facilitated by TikTok because the app provides accessible avenues for monetization that incentivize content creators to profit from fake cancer cures. This research has important implications for content moderators because the risk of cancer misinformation is not limited to the content uploaded the platform, but the ways in which short videos become a gateway to harmful products and more extreme, conspiratorial content.",Sociology

disciplines. Starting from 20,000+ references, I identify 80 research articles. Most conclude that
variations in economic segregation follow differences in economic inequality in the short term and
that reverse causality is more probable in the longer term. The housing market is the most cited

Through an interdisciplinary literature review and comparative analysis of three pioneering Indigenous-led AI initiatives, we argue that decolonising AI demands a fundamental rethinking of the values, assumptions, and power relations underpinning dominant AI systems.
Our study employs a qualitative, multi-method approach, including in-depth case studies of the Indigenous Protocol and AI Working Group, Te Mana Raraunga, and Te Hiku Media. Drawing on these cases, we propose a framework for Indigenous AI governance grounded in principles of sovereignty, reciprocity, and collective benefit.",Sociology

As a case study, we report preliminary findings of a rise in clickbait style in titles across online platforms, and use our model to explain which mechanisms could give rise to this pattern. Generally, the model serves to formulate predictions against which to compare observational data and we show how online trends can be interpreted in terms of cultural evolution. This work outlines an interdisciplinary research agenda for studying and understanding cultural evolution online, with possible implications for regulating online content and designing digital environments.",Sociology

However, this paper challenges this assertion, arguing that augmenting the context window primarily improves the LLMs' ability to generate human-like narratives rather than enhancing their capacity for real-world decision-making. The paper advocates for a paradigm shift where LLMs move beyond merely sounding human to effectively adjudicating real-world challenges, emphasizing the need for ethical and practical advancements in AI development to mitigate the risks associated with misinformation and naive use of LLMs in critical decision-making processes.

1789,,"Large local government spending cuts in England, spanning over a decade of austerity politics, have severely restricted the universal services and public goods that shape parenting environments. Drawing on the Reproductive Justice framework, we ask whether restricting the right to parent in safe and healthy environments impinged on the right to have children. To do so, we introduce a new quantitative approach for “thinking with” Reproductive Justice. Using nationally representative UK Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS) data and a within-between random effects model, we analyse whether local government spending cuts were associated with intersectional inequalities in childbearing over the 2010-2020 period. We find that local government spending cuts significantly decreased the probability of having a(nother) birth for women in the poorest households, by 9.1%, but not for women in the middle or richest households. Further, racially minoritised women across income categories were much more likely to live in local authorities that suffered substantial cuts. Although austerity policies may not have directly restricted people’s biological capacity to conceive, our findings show that local government austerity cuts unequally restricted the right to have children.",Sociology
1790,,"Equality of opportunity is a principle of social justice, although there are different conceptions of it. We distinguish between fair and luck egalitarian equality of opportunity. Both conceptions consider unfair inequalities in life chances that result from ascribed characteristics such as social origin, migration background, and gender. However, they differ in that fair equality of opportunity considers it fair when innate abilities affect life chances. Conversely, luck egalitarianism places innate abilities in the category of morally arbitrary factors that do not provide a fair basis for inequalities in life chances. We use genetic information to approximate innate abilities and compare this approach with skills measured later in life. The use of polygenic indices (PGIs) allows us to better disentangle the role of innate abilities from the roles of ascribed characteristics and individual choices. We apply this approach to two survey datasets, (1) the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study (WLS) and (2) the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP). According to our results, luck egalitarian inequality of opportunity is considerably larger than fair inequality of opportunity, especially for education. Measuring innate abilities using PGIs leads to very similar conclusions as using skills measured later in life. However, the differences between fair and luck egalitarian inequality of opportunity are smaller using PGIs than using observed skills. This study highlights the importance of taking genetic differences into account when assessing inequality of opportunity and the value of using genetic data in social science research.",Sociology

Introducing the concept of ontological erasure, the study explores how certain groups and struggles are deliberately rendered invisible or depoliticized. Through reflexive thematic analysis and semiotic analysis, the research reveals how empathy is framed selectively to align with commercial interests, transforming ethical engagement into an emotional transaction designed for consumption. The findings demonstrate how brands curate visibility and moral recognition, deciding which causes receive public attention while marginalizing others. By developing the concept of affective recognition, this study highlights the selective emotional engagement embedded in branded content and considers the implications for public understanding of social justice and moral responsibility. The theoretical contribution advances the ethics of visibility, demonstrating how the boundaries of epistemic justice are redefined within the economy of empathy.",Sociology
1792,,"This study examines the ethical dimensions of health communication during the 2022 mpox outbreak, focusing on the interplay between social media and public health officials in shaping stakeholder responses. Based on semi-structured interviews, findings reveal that social media played a crucial role in information dissemination for months during the crisis, while public health officials were slow to offer clear guidance. While social media empowers advocacy and the sharing of personal stories, it also raises ethical concerns, particularly regarding how vulnerable communities may become entangled in an economy of suffering, where their experiences of pain are validated and interpreted by stakeholders through a selective mechanism rooted in cultural codes and power dynamics. Moreover, systemic inequities render the suffering of marginalized groups, particularly those with intersecting identities, less visible and intensify the consequences of inadequate outreach. This creates a disparity where the suffering of those in more privileged positions is more readily recognized and addressed. The theoretical advancement lies in reconceptualizing the platformization of pain to include narrative resistance, highlighting that marginalized groups actively contest and reshape suffering narratives rather than passively experience them. This expanded framework also deepens the concept of an economy of suffering by integrating hermeneutical injustice, which emphasizes how power dynamics shape not only the visibility of suffering but also the interpretive frameworks that validate certain narratives while marginalizing others.",Sociology

This novel adaptation explores heterogeneity in the causal paths linking a treatment to an outcome through a binary, multinomial, or continuous mediator. Both
causal forests and causal mediation forests robustly adjust for high-dimensional confounders, yielding asymptotically normal and n1/2 consistent estimates.

To proactively inform conservation and management efforts amidst potential natural recovery, an exploratory mixed methods research design used interviews and focus groups to assess BE residents’ opinions on grizzly bear management, tolerance of grizzlies, and trust in agencies to manage grizzlies. Results from thematic analysis reveal: (1) distrust of management agencies and conservation organizations that stems from general perceptions of untrustworthiness and the wolf reintroduction that occurred in central Idaho in the mid-1990s, (2) trust-building preferences, including accessible staff and participatory opportunities, and ways for agencies and organizations to increase perceptions of trustworthiness, (3) intolerance towards management that stems from perceptions of an inequitable constitutive process that excludes BE residents from decision-making, potential threats from Endangered Species Act regulations, and a lack of clarity about current and future management plans, (4) preferred actions to increase tolerance towards management, including a decentralized decision-making process, educational outreach about grizzlies, and a hunting season, (5) intolerance towards grizzlies that stems from safety, economic, and cultural concerns, and (6) tolerance towards grizzlies that stems from appreciation and the belief in their right to exist.

In a landscape of shrinking public safety nets, an unfavorable employment landscape, and the rising cost of natural disasters, kin support networks may offer resilience against the vulnerability of households with young children impacted by structural failures in urban food systems. We evaluate the role of kinship support in strengthening household food security and young children’s dietary diversity – and the influence of relative socioeconomic status (SES) on these relationships - in two informal settlements in Nairobi, Kenya. Using four waves of longitudinal data on 1,194 mothers collected between March 2022 and October 2023, some captured during periods of food inflation, we find that 1) larger kin support networks offer protection against severe food insecurity for some households, but heighten food insecurity risk for others 2) household SES and network SES feature in reciprocal kin support dynamics that affect the direction of food insecurity outcomes, however 3) larger kin support networks improve children’s dietary diversity, regardless of household and network SES.

In this paper, we use unique register data following entire birth cohorts born from 1955 to 1985 in Norway, an egalitarian welfare state, to investigate the social origins of academic faculty. Despite free public higher education and PhD positions with competitive wages, potentially removing many barriers to entry, we find large and stable differences in the likelihood of becoming faculty members by parental education, earnings, and whether parents are faculty members. However, while the likelihood of becoming a faculty member varies widely depending on social origins, sorting into faculty positions seems to be explained mainly by differences in obtaining a PhD. Once we compare individuals with PhD educations, social origins do not seem to constitute an additional barrier to becoming a faculty member. Nevertheless, social origins influence the likelihood of obtaining a position at more prestigious institutions, and faculty members from more advantageous backgrounds have higher earnings. Thus, social origins shape academic careers beyond their effects on entering academia.",Sociology

Accurately estimating visitor numbers to these areas is essential for understanding current recreation demand, planning for future use, and ensuring the ongoing protection of the ecosystems that refuges safeguard. However, accurately estimating visitation across the entire refuge system presents significant challenges. Building on previous research conducted on other federal lands, this study evaluates methods to overcome constraints in estimating visitation levels using statistical models and digital mobility data. We develop and test a visitation modeling approach using multiple linear regression, incorporating predictors from eight mobility data sources, including four social media platforms, one community science platform, and three mobile device location datasets from two commercial vendors. We find that the total number of observed visitors to refuges correlates with the volume of data from each mobility data source. However, neither social media nor mobile device location data alone provide reliable proxies for visitation due to inconsistent relationships with observed visitation; these relationships vary by data source, refuge, and time. Our results demonstrate that a visitation model integrating multiple mobility datasets accounts for this variability and outperforms models based on individual mobility datasets. We find that a refuge-level effect is the single most important predictor, suggesting that including site characteristics in future models will make them more generalizable. We conclude that statistical models which incorporate digital mobility data have the potential to improve the accuracy of visitor estimates, standardize data collection methods, and simplify the estimation process for agency staff.",Sociology
1799,,"Background:
Social media's rapid evolution has increased exposure to suspected suicides, driven by the democratisation of media content through polymediated transmission. There is a wide gap in our understanding of the impact of this phenomenon, and no research from preventive public and mental health perspectives. This study aimed to examine social media exposure to suspected suicide and its impact on communities from the perspectives of public and mental health. 

Methods:
Knowledge Exchange workshops and in-depth interviews with public health and mental health professionals who work in a responding capacity following a suspected suicide informed the study. Their observations and experiences provided insights into polymediated exposure: how platforms operate, user behaviour, context of use, impact on communities and challenges and opportunities for intervention. A thematic and narrative analysis of qualitative data was conducted. 

Results:
The study emphasises polymedia as a theoretical framework for understanding how the intertwining of diverse social media platforms transforms the way narratives relating to suspected suicides unfold. Analysis of the communicative ecology of social media highlighted the dual potential of social media content to both amplify and mitigate the risk of suicide.  Data underscored the role of social media in fuelling increased exposure to harmful discourse in multiple and often unexpected ways, contributing to the copycat effect. Responsible content moderation and protective discourse can reverse these effects; however, these efforts may be compromised by algorithms that favour the Werther effect and social media’s connection to users’ reduced attention span, which affects their capacity to think before posting.

Conclusion: 
This study contributes important new knowledge into the ways in which social media transforms exposure to suicide and compelling new evidence for direct impact on communities. As the public play an increasingly active role in generating new forms of media and narratives surrounding suspected suicides, 
Polymedia theory and the communicative ecology of social media emerge as pivotal factors that warrant a more prominent role in shaping suicide prevention policy. Responding to and managing social media risks requires a new, coordinated public health approach that goes beyond existing guidelines. There is a clear call for the augmentation of existing guidelines to encompass the dynamic nature of social media's influence, involving public health and allied organisations in this crucial endeavour.

The article being formed is formed between the core and the mold. The space between the core and the mold is filled with the curable liquid material of which the article is to be formed and the hollow core is also filled with a liquid material. The liquid material in the hollow core, the material from which the core is constructed and the curable liquid material all have about the same specific gravity. The mold and core are rotated to centrifugally cast the article which is formed of the curable liquid material. The deformable core permits easy removal from the completed article and the matching of the specific gravities as aforementioned keeps the deformable core from distorting during the centrifugal casting operation. The order of introducing the liquid material into the core, introducing the curable liquid into the space between the mold and core and rotation of the mold and core can be varied within the limits as set forth in the following description.

The present conclusion--that attitudes, self-esteem, and stereotypes have important implicit modes of operation--extends both the construct validity and predictive usefulness of these major theoretical constructs of social psychology. Methodologically, this review calls for increased use of indirect measures--which are imperative in studies of implicit cognition. The theorized ordinariness of implicit stereotyping is consistent with recent findings of discrimination by people who explicitly disavow prejudice. The finding that implicit cognitive effects are often reduced by focusing judges' attention on their judgment task provides a basis for evaluating applications (such as affirmative action) aimed at reducing such unintended discrimination.",Psychology
1804,65.0,"Phenomena currently attributed to Dark Energy (DE) and Dark Matter (DM) are merely a result of the interplay between gravitational energy density, generated by the contraction of space by matter, and the energy density of the Cosmological Microwave Background (CMB), which causes space dilation. In the universe, globally, the gravitational energy density equals the CMB energy density. This leads to the derivation of the Hubble parameter, H, as a function of the scale factor, a, the time, t, the redshift, z, and to the calculation of its present value. It also leads to a new understanding of the cosmological redshift and the Euclidian nature of the universe. From H(t) we conclude that the time derivative of a is constant. This is in contrast to the consensus of the last decade. This result is supported by the fit of our theoretically derived flux from supernovae (SN) as a function of z, with observation. This flux is derived based on our H(z) that determines DL, the Luminosity Distance. We obtain this fit without any free parameters, whereas in current cosmology this fit is obtained by using the dependent free parameters Omega_M and Omega_Lambda.",Astronomy
1805,197.0,"The properties of the early-type binary Cyg OB2 #5 have been debated for many years and spectroscopic and photometric investigations yielded conflicting results. We have attempted to constrain the physical properties of the binary by collecting new optical and X-ray observations. We find that the orbital period of the system slowly changes though we are unable to discriminate between several possible explanations of this trend. The best fit solution of the continuum light curve reveals a contact configuration with the secondary star being significantly brighter and hotter on its leading side facing the primary. The mean temperature of the secondary star turns out to be only slightly lower than that of the primary, whilst the bolometric luminosity ratio is found to be 3.1. The solution of the light curve yields a distance of 925 +/- 25 pc much lower than the usually assumed distance of the Cyg OB2 association. Whilst we confirm the existence of episodes of higher X-ray fluxes, the data reveal no phase-locked modulation with the 6.6 day period of the eclipsing binary nor any clear relation between the X-ray flux and the 6.7 yr radio cycle. The bright region of the secondary star is probably heated by energy transfer in a common envelope in this contact binary system as well as by the collision with the primary's wind. The existence of a common photosphere probably also explains the odd mass-luminosity relation of the stars in this system. Most of the X-ray, non-thermal radio, and possibly gamma-ray emission of Cyg OB2 #5 is likely to arise from the interaction of the combined wind of the eclipsing binary with at least one additional star of this multiple system.",Astronomy
1806,683.0,"Within the last few decades an amplified interest in emotions can be noticed. This new interest occurs both in the neurosciences as well as in philosophy, anthropology and also Anglo-American sociology. Treatises on human feelings can be found in the sociological classics, but then came an extensive exclusion of this topic (until the 1970s and 1980s). Discussing the question of why emotions were neglected for such a long time in sociology, one can concentrate either on the 'Zeitgeist' or on the internal structure of the scientific system as reasons for the disregard and rediscovery of a topic. After a short overview of this debate and a first outline of the subject area the academic field of the 'sociology of emotions' is described further. Especially in the AngloAmerican sociology a lot of empirical and theoretical works on different emotions can be found now. Two main directions can be distinguished within the sociology of emotions: One approach is aimed at analyzing the shaping of emotions by the social. The other approach is aimed at analyzing the structuring influence of emotions on social phenomena. The article closes with some examples for a synthesis of both approaches and a short introduction into methodological questions concerning empirical research in the field of sociology of emotions",Sociology

Drawing on British examples, we argue that whereas over the past 40 years sociologists championed innovative methodological resources, notably the sample survey and the in-depth interviews, which reasonably allowed them to claim distinctive expertise to access the `social' in powerful ways, such claims are now much less secure. We argue that both the sample survey and the in-depth interview are increasingly dated research methods, which are unlikely to provide a robust base for the jurisdiction of empirical sociologists in coming decades. We conclude by speculating how sociology might respond to this coming crisis through taking up new interests in the `politics of method'.",Sociology

The whole world of nation sovereignty is fading away – including the ‘container theory of society’ on which most of the sociology of the first age of modernity is based upon. In this article I propose a distinction between ‘simple globalization’ and ‘reflexive cosmopolitization’. In the paradigm of the first age of modernity, simple globalization is interpreted within the territorial compass of state and politics, society and culture. This involves an additive, not substitutive, conception of globalization as indicated for example by ‘interconnectedness’. In the paradigm of the second age of modernity globalization changes not only the relations between and beyond national states and societies, but also the inner quality of the social and political itself which is indicated by more or less reflexive cosmopolitization as an institutionalized learning process – and its enemies.",Sociology

Some considerations on formalisation of language suggests that the more formalised it is, the less information it contains. If it is true, it is not reasonable to hope that a formalised language like that used by computers may be a model for thought. Finally, the lack of status of thought, as far as it is a subjective experience and the impossibility of giving it a definition as far as it exceeds language, make it clear that in spite of progress in scientific psychology, thought, per se, is not an object for science.",Psychology

The purpose of this review is to discuss three commonly used ways to demonstrate rigor when conducting or judging qualitative research in sport and exercise psychology. These are the method of member checking, the method of inter-rater reliability, and the notion of universal criteria. Problems with each method are first highlighted. Member checking and inter-rater reliability are shown to be ineffective for verification, trustworthiness, or reliability purposes. Next, universal criteria within the context of Tracy’s, heavily drawn on paper within sport and exercise psychology is problematized. Throughout the discussion of each method and universal criteria more suitable possibilities for conducting rigorous qualitative research are offered. The paper concludes that to support high-quality qualitative research, scholars – including journal editors and reviewers – need to change how rigor is developed and judged, rather than perpetuate the problems with how it has been commonly evaluated in the past. Recommendations for developing rigor when conducting and/or judging qualitative research within sport and exercise psychology are also offered.",Psychology

It's making us re-think many of our existing assumptions about what it means to be a social being. For instance, if we can talk, flirt, meet people and fall in love online, this challenges many of psychology's theories that intimacy or understanding requires physical co-presence. The Oxford Handbook of Internet Psychology brings together many of the leading researchers in what can be termed 'Internet Psychology'. Though a very new area of research, it is growing at a phenomenal pace. In addition to well-studied areas of investigation, such as social identity theory, computer-mediated communication and virtual communities, the volume also includes chapters on topics as diverse as deception and misrepresentation, attitude change and persuasion online, Internet addiction, online relationships, privacy and trust, health and leisure use of the Internet, and the nature of interactivity. With over 30 chapters written by experts in the field, the range and depth of coverage is unequalled, and serves to define this emerging area of research. Uniquely, this content is supported by an entire section covering the use of the Internet as a research tool, including qualitative and quantitative methods, online survey design, personality testing, ethics, and technological and design issues. While it is likely to be a popular research resource to be 'dipped into', as a whole volume it is coherent and compelling enough to act as a single text book. The Oxford Handbook of Internet Psychology is the definitive text on this burgeoning field. It will be an essential resource for anyone interested in the psychological aspects of Internet use, or planning to conduct research using the 'net'.",Psychology

We characterize a positive psychology intervention as any intentional activity or method that is based on (a) the cultivation of positive subjective experiences, (b) the building of positive individual traits, or (c) the building of civic virtue and positive institutions. A systematic literature search identified 15 studies that examined the effects of such an intervention in organizational contexts. Subsequent analyses of those studies revealed that positive psychology interventions seem to be a promising tool for enhancing employee well-being and performance. As a side-effect, positive psychology interventions also tend to diminish stress and burnout and to a lesser extent depression and anxiety. Implications of those findings for theory and praxis and recommendations for future research on positive psychology interventions in organizations are discussed.",Psychology
1819,839.0,"Historical sociologists have criticized their discipline for a tendency to ignore the temporal dimensions of social life, either by studying the correlates of outcomes rather than the character of temporally connected events or by treating events as surface manifestations of large-scale and long-term processes of change. These critiques have led to a reassessment of the value of narratives and to new methods for mapping historical sequences of events. Yet there has been relatively little discussion of the concepts needed to create a more event-centered historical sociology. This article explores the way in which four different concepts of time-duration, pace, trajectory, and cycle-have been used in recent historical social science. These concepts allow one to analyze the temporal characteristics of connected events that constitute long-term historical processes as well as the way in which actors understand and experience the temporal flow of events. They are most useful, the author argues when employed in a manner that is attentive to the understandings of social actors and the problematic reconstruction of the past. These concepts constitute building blocks for the construction of a more event-centered historical sociology.",Sociology

Cherenkov telescope was used to search for very fast optical transients of astrophysical origin. 43 hours of observations targeting stellar-mass black holes and neutron stars were obtained using a dedicated photometer with microsecond time resolution. The photometer consists of seven photomultiplier tube pixels: a central one to monitor the target and a surrounding ring of six pixels to veto background events. The light curves of all pixels were recorded continuously and were searched offline with a matched-filtering technique for flares with a duration of 2 us to 100 ms. As expected, many unresolved (&lt;3 us) and many long (&gt;500 us) background events originating in the earth's atmosphere were detected. In the time range 3 to 500 us the measurement is essentially background-free, with only eight events detected in 43 h; five from lightning and three presumably from a piece of space debris. The detection of flashes of brightness ~ 0.1 Jy and only 20 us duration from the space debris shows the potential of this setup to find rare optical flares on timescales of tens of microseconds. This timescale corresponds to the light crossing time of stellar-mass black holes and neutron stars.",Astronomy
1822,121.0,"Polarimeric maps have been used on the characterization of the magnetic field in molecular clouds. However, it is difficult to determine the 3-dimensional properties of these regions from the projected maps. In that case, numerical simulations can be used as benchmarks for polarimetric measurements, and evetually reveal more about the interplay of turbulence and the magnetic field lines. In this work we provide a number of MHD numerical simulations of turbulent molecular clouds and created their synthetic dust emission polarization maps, varying the direction of the observer. We determined the correlation of emission intensity and polarization degree for the simulated models. We were able to reproduce the decay on polarization degree at denser regions without any assumption regarding the properties of the dusty component. The anti-correlation arises from the simple cancelation of the polarization vectors along the line of sight. This effect is amplified within denser regions as the magnetic field configuration becomes more complex. We studied the probability distribution, the power spectrum and the structure function of the polarization angles. These statistical analysis revealed strong defferences depending on the turbulent regime (i.e. sub/supersonic and sub/super-Alfvenic). Therefore, these methods can be used on polarimetric observations to characterize the dynamics of molecular clouds. We also presented a modified Chandrashekhar-Fermi method to obtain the intensity of the local magnetic field. The proposed formulation showed no limitations regarding orientation or turbulent regime.",Astronomy

Methods: We conducted a systematic frequency analysis of CASE photometry of Omega Cen RR Lyr stars. We searched for periodicities using Fourier and ANOVA periodograms, combined with consecutive prewhitening technique. Results: We discovered six double mode pulsators, with the first overtone and a secondary mode of higher frequency simultaneously excited. These are the first double mode RR Lyr stars identified in Omega Cen. In variable V10 period ratio of the two modes is 0.80, which corresponds to pulsations in the first and second radial overtones. In V19 and V105 we found unexpected period ratio of 0.61. Three other stars display period ratios of either ~0.80 or ~0.61, depending on the choice of aliases. Conclusions: While the period ratio of ~0.80 is easy to interpret in terms of two lowest radial overtones, the value of ~0.61 cannot be explained by any two radial modes. Thus, V19 and V105 are the first members of a new class of double mode RR Lyr pulsators.",Astronomy

1830,175.0,"Large-scale radial transport of solids appears to be a fundamental consequence of protoplanetary disk evolution based on the presence of high temperature minerals in comets and the outer regions of protoplanetary disks around other stars. Further, inward transport of solids from the outer regions of the solar nebula has been postulated to be the manner in which short-lived radionuclides were introduced to the terrestrial planet region and the cause of the variations in oxygen isotope ratios seen in primitive materials. Here, both outward and inward transport of solids are investigated in the context of a two-dimensional, viscously evolving protoplanetary disk. The dynamics of solids are investigated to determine how they depend on particle size and the particular stage of protoplanetary disk evolution, corresponding to different rates of mass transport. It is found that the outward flows that arise around the disk midplane of a protoplanetary disk aid in the outward transport of solids up to the size of CAIs and can increase the crystallinity fraction of silicate dust at 10 AU around a solar mass star to as much as $\sim$40% in the case of rapidly evolving disks, decreasing as the accretion rate onto the star slows. High velocity, inward flows along the disk surface aid in the rapid transport of solids from the outer disk to the inner disk, particularly for small dust. Despite the diffusion that occurs throughout the disk, the large-scale, meridonal flows associated with mass transport prevent complete homogenization of the disk, allowing compositional gradients to develop that vary in intensity for a timescale of one million years.",Astronomy
1831,237.0,"The form of the primordial power spectrum has the potential to differentiate strongly between competing models of perturbation generation in the early universe and so is of considerable importance. The recent release of five years of WMAP observations have confirmed the general picture of the primordial power spectrum as deviating slightly from scale invariance with a spectral tilt parameter of n_s ~ 0.96. Nonetheless, many attempts have been made to isolate further features such as breaks and cutoffs using a variety of methods, some employing more than ~ 10 varying parameters. In this paper we apply the robust technique of Bayesian model selection to reconstruct the optimal degree of structure in the spectrum. We model the spectrum simply and generically as piecewise linear in ln k between `nodes' in k-space whose amplitudes are allowed to vary. The number of nodes and their k-space positions are chosen by the Bayesian evidence so that we can identify both the complexity and location of any detected features. Our optimal reconstruction contains, perhaps, surprisingly few features, the data preferring just three nodes. This reconstruction allows for a degree of scale dependence of the tilt with the `turn-over' scale occuring around k ~ 0.016 Mpc^{-1}. More structure is penalised by the evidence as over-fitting the data, so there is currently little point in attempting reconstructions that are more complex.",Astronomy

The effect of the neutrino component is included by using the linear theory neutrino perturbations in the calculation of the gravitational potential in the N-body simulation. By comparing this new method with the full non-linear evolution first presented in \cite{Brandbyge1}, where the neutrino component was treated as particles, we find that the new method calculates the matter power spectrum with an accuracy better than 1% for \sum m_\nu \lesssim 0.5 eV at z = 0. This error scales approximately as (\sum m_\nu)^2, making the new linear neutrino method extremely accurate for a total neutrino mass in the range 0.05 - 0.3 eV. At z = 1 the error is below 0.3% for \sum m_\nu \lesssim 0.5 eV and becomes negligible at higher redshifts.

The integration of feelings, affects, moods and emotional states into sociological research, which began four decades ago with the birth of the sociology of emotions, must continue advancing until emotions are fully integrated into the general sociological perspective. This article offers an introductory and critical overview of the work sociologists of emotions have carried out so far. They have helped us, first of all, to understand what an emotion is, the countless number of existing feelings, and the great complexity of emotional processes. Second, they have revealed the social nature of human emotions, and the emotional nature of social phenomena. Third, they have developed a number of theoretical approaches to studying the emotions. And, lastly, they have carried out sociological analyses of many specific emotions (fear, trust, shame, etc.), and emotional analyses in many areas of sociology (gender, work, organizations, social movements, etc.). This article also offers suggestions for the future development of the sociology of emotions, and a selected and updated bibliography.",Sociology
1843,67.0,"Recently the PAMELA satellite-based experiment reported an excess of galactic positrons that could be a signal of annihilating dark matter. The PAMELA data may admit an interpretation as a signal from a wino-like LSP of mass about 200 GeV, normalized to the local relic density, and annihilating mainly into W-bosons. This possibility requires the current conventional estimate for the energy loss rate of positrons be too large by roughly a factor of five. Data from anti-protons and gamma rays also provide tension with this interpretation, but there are significant astrophysical uncertainties associated with their propagation. It is not unreasonable to take this well-motivated candidate seriously, at present, in part because it can be tested in several ways soon. The forthcoming PAMELA data on higher energy positrons and the FGST (formerly GLAST) data, should provide important clues as to whether this scenario is correct. If correct, the wino interpretation implies a cosmological history in which the dark matter does not originate in thermal equilibrium.",Astronomy

The literature is providing increasingly nuanced conceptualizations of adjustment, demonstrating that the experience of chronic disease necessitates adaptation in multiple life domains. Heterogeneity in adjustment is apparent between individuals and across the course of the disease trajectory. Focusing on cancer, cardiovascular disease, and rheumatic diseases, we review longitudinal investigations of distal (socioeconomic variables, culture/ethnicity, and gender-related processes) and proximal (interpersonal relationships, personality attributes, cognitive appraisals, and coping processes) risk and protective factors for adjustment across time. We observe that the past decade has seen a surge in research that is longitudinal in design, involves adequately characterized samples of sufficient size, and includes statistical control for initial values on dependent variables. A progressively convincing characterization of risk and protective factors for favorable adjustment to chronic illness has emerged. We identify critical issues for future research.",Psychology
1845,979.0,"‘Theory’ is one of the most important words in the lexicon of contemporary sociology. Yet, their ubiquity notwithstanding, it is quite unclear what sociologists mean by the words ‘theory,’ ‘theoretical,’ and ‘theorize.’ I argue that confusions about the meaning of ‘theory’ have brought about undesirable consequences, including conceptual muddles and even downright miscommunication. In this paper I tackle two questions: (a) what does ‘theory’ mean in the sociological language?; and (b) what ought ‘theory’ to mean in the sociological language? I proceed in five stages. First, I explain why one should ask a semantic question about ‘theory.’ Second, I lexicographically identify seven different senses of the word, which I distinguish by means of subscripts. Third, I show some difficulties that the current lack of semantic clarity has led sociology to. Fourth, I articulate the question, ‘what ought “theory” to mean?,’ which I dub the ‘semantic predicament’ (SP), and I consider what one can learn about it from the theory literature. Fifth, I recommend a semantic therapy‘ for sociology, and advance two arguments about SP: (a) the principle of practical reason—SP is to a large extent a political issue, which should be addressed with the help of political mechanisms; and (b) the principle of ontological and epistemological pluralism—the solution to SP should not be too ontologically and epistemologically demanding.",Sociology
1846,609.0,"This article explores three ways in which the positive psychology movement’s construction and presentation of itself are negative. First, the negative side is construed as the negative side effects of positive psychology’s dominant, separatist message. Second, the negative side is construed as the negativity that can be found within the positive psychology movement. Here the author elaborates on the negative or dismissive reactions of some spokespersons for the movement to ideas or views that run counter to the movement’s dominant message: (a) negativity about negativity itself, which is explored by way of research in health psychology and coping styles; and (b) negativity about the wrong kind of positivity, namely, allegedly unscientific positivity, especially that which Seligman purports to find within humanistic psychology. This constitutes an epistemological position that contributes to “reality problems” for positive psychologists. The author concludes with the implications of positive psychology’s “Declaration of Independence” for psychology’s much discussed fragmentation woes. She appeals to the wisdom of William James for guidance in finding a third, more positive meaning of positive psychology’s negative side. This third meaning can be gleaned from a not-yet-dominant but more integrative message emerging within the movement, one compatible with the reactions of some humanistic psychologists to positive psychology.",Psychology
1847,585.0,"For many years, for many people social psychology has been deemed a discipline in crisis. Factions within the field have emerged as the field has struggled to find a new identity for what social psychology is. In spite of recent efforts to forge connections across these paradigmatical territories many academics remain locked in perpetual disagreement to this day.This new book proposes a way out of the crisis by letting go of the idea that psychology needs new foundations or a new identity, whether biological, discursive, or cognitive. The psychological is not narrowly confined to any one aspect of human experience; it is quite literally everywhere. Drawing on a range of influential thinkers including Michel Serres, Michel Foucault, AN Whitehead and Gilles Deleuze, the book proposes a strong process-oriented approach to the psychological which studies events or occasions. Aspects of experience such as communication or embodiment are treated as thoroughly mediated – the product of multiple intersecting relationships between the biological, the psychic, and the social. The outcome is an image of a ‘mobile’ reflexively founded discipline which follows the psychological wherever it takes us, from the depths of embodiment to the complexities of modern global politics.The critically important new text is written in a way that is accessible for undergraduate students as well as more advanced readers and could be an exciting gateway into a new understanding of the rich, historical discipline of psychology",Psychology
1848,625.0,"Abstract : The concept of rationality has been basic to most economic analysis. Its content has been successively refined over the generations. As applied to the static world of certainty, it has turned out to be a weak hypothesis, not easily refuted and therefore not very useful as an explanation, though not literally a tautology. But recent decades have seen the development of stronger versions applied to a world in which time and uncertainty are real. Among its most important manifestations have been criteria for consistency in allocation over time, the expected-utility hypothesis of behavior under uncertainty, and what may be termed the Bayesian hypothesis for learning, that is the consistent use of conditional probabilities for changing beliefs on the basis of new information. These hypotheses have been used widely in offering explanations of empirically-observed behavior, though as not infrequently in economics, the theoretical development has gone much further than the empirical implementation. These hypotheses have also been used increasingly in normative analysis, as a component of benefit-cost studies (therefore frequently referred to as benefit-risk studies). The value of reducing mortality rates from diseases, for example, has been studied by assuming that choice of occupations is made inter alia by comparing wage differences with mortality differences.",Psychology

1850,926.0,"The history of the concept of values is reviewed from its beginnings in the 19th century to the present. Work on values rose to preeminence under Talcott Parsons and his associates during 1950-1965, Nevertheless, the theory they produced was flawed: It lacked sophisticated empirical support, imposed preordained categories on reality, and was formulated at an unresearchable level of abstraction. Alternative theories of values fared only somewhat better. More vibrant is the long tradition of (nonParsonian) empirical studies in various subject areas (e.g. achievement, religion). This body of work, however, is ad hoc in nature: The data produced are essentially noncomparable and do not advance the concerns of value theory. The recent work of Kohn (on class and values) and Rokeach (on general value systems) has begun to remedy the situation. It is suggested that value analysis of the future can only solve past ditficulties if (a) it develops grounded theory and research methods—i.e, hypotheses and techniques t...",Sociology
1851,935.0,"Sociology has become the science of the interview, and that in two senses. In the first sense the interview has become the favored digging tool of a large army of sociologists. The several branches of social study are distinguished from one another perhaps more by their predilection for certain kinds of data and certain instruments for digging them up than by their logic. While the essential features of human society have probably varied within fairly narrow limits in all times and places where men lived, certain of these features can be more effectively observed in direct contact with living people. Others may perhaps be best seen through the eyes of men who left documents behind them. Sociologists have become mainly students of living people. Some, to be sure, do still study documents. Some observe people in situ; others experiment on them and look at them literally in vitro. But, by and large, the sociologist of North America, and in a slightly less degree in other countries has become an interviewer. The interview is his tool; his works bear the marks of it. Interviews are of many kinds. Some sociologists like them standardized and so formulated that they can be ""administered"" to large groups of people. This can be done only among large homogeneous populations not too unlike the investigator himself in culture. Where languages are too diverse, where common values are too few, where the fear of talking to strangers is too great, there the interview based on a standardized questionnaire calling for a few standardized answers may not be applicable. Those who venture into such situations may have to invent new modes of interviewing. Some of the articles which follow deal with problems of large-scale standardized interviews; others tell of the peculiar problems of interviewing special kinds of people. In the second sense sociology is the science of the interview in a more essential way. The subject matter of sociology is interaction. Conversation of verbal and other gestures is an almost constant activity of human beings. The main business of sociology is to gain systematic knowledge of social rhetoric; to gain the knowledge, we must become skilled in the rhetoric itself. Every conversation has its own balance of revelation and concealment of thoughts and intentions: only under very unusual circumstances is talk so completely expository that every word can be taken at face value. The model of such exposition is the exchange of information among scientists. Each is pledged to tell all he knows of the subject in terms whose meanings are strictly denoted.

In this article, supervision is proposed as a core competency area in psychology for which a number of elements reflecting specific knowledge, skills, and values must be addressed to ensure adequate training and professional development of the trainee. Supra-ordinate factors of supervision viewed as permeating all aspects of professional development are proposed. These include the perspective that professional development is a lifelong, cumulative process requiring attention to diversity in all its forms, as well as legal and ethical issues, personal and professional factors, and self- and peer-assessment. A competencies framework is presented with particular elements representing knowledge (e.g., about psychotherapy, research, etc.), skills (including supervising modalities, relationship skills, etc.), values (e.g., responsibility for the clients and supervisee rests with supervisor, etc.), and meta-knowledge. Social contextual factors and issues of education and training, assessment, and future directions also are addressed, with specific elements listed. Suggestions for future work in this area are addressed, including the need to refine further and operationalize competences, develop clear expectations for accreditation and licensure regarding supervision competencies, and expand the description of developmental levels of supervisors from minimal to optimal competence.

1853,195.0,"The rapidly varying (~10 minute timescale) non-thermal X-ray emission observed from Sgr A* implies that particle acceleration is occuring close to the event horizon of the supermassive black hole. The TeV gamma-ray source HESS J1745-290 is coincident with Sgr A* and may be closely related to its X-ray emission. Simultaneous X-ray and TeV observations are required to elucidate the relationship between these objects. We report on joint H.E.S.S./Chandra observations performed in July 2005, during which an X-ray flare was detected. Despite a factor of 9 increase in the X-ray flux of Sgr A*, no evidence is found for an increase in the TeV gamma-ray flux from this region. We find that an increase in the gamma-ray flux of a factor of 2 or greater can be excluded at a confidence level of 99%.

1855,821.0,"The German sociologist Ulrich Beck has elaborated a highly original formulation of the theory of risk and reflexive modernization, a formulation that has had a significant impact upon recent sociological theorizing and research. This article examines Beck's sociology of risk in the context of his broader social theory of reflexvity, advanced modernization and individualization. The article argues that Beck's work is constrained by several sociological weaknesses: namely, a dependence upon objectivistic and instrumental models of the social construction of risk and uncertainty in social relations, and a failure to adequately define the relations between institutional dynamism on the one hand and self-referentiality and critical reflection on the other. As a contribution to the reformulation and further development of Beck's approach to sociological theory, the article seeks to suggest other ways in which the link between risk and reflexivity might be pursued. These include a focus upon 91) the intermixing of reflexivity and reflection in social relations; (2) contemporary ideologies of domination and power; and (3) a dialectical notion of modernity and postmodernization.",Sociology

Of all the second order sources that can induce non-Gaussianity during recombination, we concentrate on those proportional to the perturbation in the free electron density, which is about a factor of 5 larger than the other first order perturbations. This term induces some non-Gaussianity by delaying the time of recombination and by changing the photon diffusion scale. We find that the signal is not scale invariant, peaked on squeezed triangles with the smaller multipole around the scale of the first acoustic peak, and that its size corresponds to an effective f_NL ~ -3.5, which could be marginally detected by Planck if both temperature and polarization are measured.",Astronomy
1857,222.0,"This paper presents estimations on the possibility of detection of ellipsoidal variations by means of measuring brightness of the star distorted by a close massive planet using Wilson-Devinney method. The problem was already discussed by Phafl et al. (2008) and earlier by Loeb and Gaudi (2003). The effect is well known in the case of binary stars where it can produce light curves with amplitutudes of ellipsoidal variations of about 0.1 mag for distorted stars. For planets the effect is very small and usually less than 0.0001 mag. The detection of an exoplanet, by searching for small amplitude ellipsoidal variations, will be very difficult and affected by other photometric effects; however, it maybe possible for some extreme cases. Observations of ellipsoidal variations can provide additional constraints on the model of the system. Light curves for few star/planet systems have been calculated using PHOEBE eclipsing binary software based on Wilson-Devinney method. As an example of ellipsoidal variations the synthetic light curve for tau Bootis is presented. The amplitude of ellipsoidal variation is 0.01 mmag.

1858,146.0,"Context. An accurate estimate of the local standard of rest (LSR) is required to determine key parameters used in approximate galactic mass models and to understand Galactic structure and evolution. However, authors are often forced to base dynamical analyses on potentially unreliable figures because recent determinations of the LSR have failed to reach agreement, especially with regard to the direction, V, of Galactic rotation. Aims. To explain why the traditional method for calculating the LSR fails, and to find alternative means of calculating the LSR with realistic error margins. Methods. We assemble and investigate the kinematic properties of 20 574 stars within 300pc, with complete and accurate kinematic data. The traditional method of calculating the LSR assumes a well-mixed distribution. In fact, the velocity distribution is highly structured, invalidating calculations based on mean motions and asymmetric drift. We find other indicators in the distribution which we believe give a better estimate of circular motion. Results. We find good agreement between results and give as our best estimate of the LSR (U_0, V_0, W_0) = (7.5 +- 1.0, 13.5 +- 0.3, 6.8 +- 0.1) km/s.

1859,152.0,"Relativistic current carrying strings moving axisymmetrically on the background of a Kerr black hole are studied. The boundaries and possible types of motion of a string with a given energy and current are found. Regions of parameters for which the string falls into the black hole, or is trapped in a toroidal volume, or can escape to infinity, are identified, and representative trajectories are examined by numerical integration, illustrating various interesting behaviors. In particular, we find that a string can start out at rest near the equatorial plane and, after bouncing around, be ejected out along the axis, some of its internal (elastic or rotational kinetic) energy having been transformed into translational kinetic energy. The resulting velocity can be an order unity fraction of the speed of light. This process results from the presence of an outer tension barrier and an inner angular momentum barrier that are deformed by the gravitational field. We speculatively discuss the possible astrophysical significance of this mechanism as a means of launching a collimated jet of MHD plasma flux tubes along the spin axis of a gravitating system fed by an accretion disk.",Astronomy

This paper draws out lessons of recent work from sociological theory, cognitive science, psychology, and neuroscience on the embodied nature of knowledge and thought, and develops implications of these lessons for cultural and cognitive sociology. Knowledge ought to be conceived of as fundamentally embodied, because sensory information is a fundamental component of experience as it is stored in long-term memory, and because bodily responses and intuitions often precede reflexive or strategic thought.

It requires the density to be expressed as a sum of products of functions of the potential and of the radial coordinate. The solution corresponding to this type of density is in turn a sum of products of functions of the energy and of the magnitude of the angular momentum. The products of the density and its radial and transverse velocity dispersions can be also expressed as a sum of products of functions of the potential and of the radial coordinate. Several examples are given, including some of new anisotropic distribution functions.

1866,238.0,"(abridged) In this paper we derive observed and modelled shape parameters (apparent ellipticity and orientation of the ellipse) of 650 Galactic open clusters identified in the ASCC-2.5 catalogue. We provide the observed shape parameters of Galactic open clusters, computed with the help of a multi-component analysis. For the vast majority of clusters these parameters are determined for the first time. High resolution (""star by star"") N-body simulations are carried out with the specially developed $\phi$GRAPE code providing models of clusters of different initial masses, Galactocentric distances and rotation velocities. The comparison of models and observations of about 150 clusters reveals ellipticities of observed clusters which are too low (0.2 vs. 0.3), and offers the basis to find the main reason for this discrepancy. The models predict that after $\approx 50$ Myr clusters reach an oblate shape with an axes ratio of $1.65:1.35:1$, and with the major axis tilted by an angle of $q_{XY} \approx 30^\circ$ with respect to the Galactocentric radius due to differential rotation of the Galaxy. Unbiased estimates of cluster shape parameters require reliable membership determination in large cluster areas up to 2-3 tidal radii where the density of cluster stars is considerably lower than the background. Although dynamically bound stars outside the tidal radius contribute insignificantly to the cluster mass, their distribution is essential for a correct determination of cluster shape parameters. In contrast, a restricted mass range of cluster stars does not play such a dramatic role, though deep surveys allow to identify more cluster members and, therefore, to increase the accuracy of the observed shape parameters.",Astronomy

1868,748.0,"Financial markets have often been seen by economists as efficient mechanisms that fulfill vital functions within economies. But do financial markets really operate in such a straightforward manner? The Sociology of Financial Markets approaches financial markets from a sociological perspective. It seeks to provide an adequate sociological coneptualization of financial markets, and examines who the actors within them are, how they operate, within which networks, and how these networks are structured. Patterns of trading, trading room coordination, and global interaction are studied to help us better understand how markets work and the types of reasoning behind these trends. Financial markets also have a structural impact on the governance of social and economic institutions. Until now, sociologists have examined issues of governance mostly with respect to the legal framework of financial transactions. Contributions in this book highlight the ways in which financial markets shape the inner working and structure of corporations and their governance. Finally the book seeks to investigate the symbolic aspects of financial markets. Financial markets affect not only economic and social structures but also societal cultural images and frameworks of meaning. Barbara Czarniawska demonstrates how representations of gender relationships are a case in point. Arguing that financial markets are not simply neutral with respect to questions of gender but enhance certain images and interpretations of men and women. Addressing many important topics from a sociological perspective for the first time, this book will be key reading for academics, researchers, and advanced students of financial markets in Business, Management, Economics, Finance, and Sociology.

1869,282.0,"In Paper I we presented a detailed formulation of the relativistic shocks and synchrotron emission in the context of Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) physics. To see how well this model reproduces the observed characteristics of the GRBs and their afterglows, here we present the results of some simulations based on this model. They are meant to reproduce the prompt and afterglow emission in some intervals of time during a burst. We show that this goal is achieved for both short and long GRBs and their afterglows, at least for part of the parameter space. Moreover, these results are the evidence of the physical relevance of the two phenomenological models we have suggested in Paper I for the evolution of the {\it active region}, the synchrotron emitting region in a shock. The dynamical active region model seems to reproduce the observed characteristics of prompt emissions and late afterglow better than the quasi-steady model which is more suitable for the onset of afterglows. Therefore these simulations confirm the arguments presented in Paper I about the behaviour of these models based on their physical properties.",Astronomy
1870,239.0,"The impact of environment on AGN activity up to z~1 is assessed by utilizing a mass-selected sample of galaxies from the 10k catalog of the zCOSMOS spectroscopic redshift survey. We identify 147 AGN by their X-ray emission as detected by XMM-Newton from a parent sample of 7234 galaxies. We measure the fraction of galaxies with stellar mass M_*&gt;2.5x10^10 Msun that host an AGN as a function of local overdensity using the 5th, 10th and 20th nearest neighbors that cover a range of physical scales (~1-4 Mpc). Overall, we find that AGNs prefer to reside in environments equivalent to massive galaxies with substantial levels of star formation. Specifically, AGNs with host masses between 0.25-1x10^11 Msun span the full range of environments (i.e., field-to-group) exhibited by galaxies of the same mass and rest-frame color or specific star formation rate. Host galaxies having M_*&gt;10^11 Msun clearly illustrate the association with star formation since they are predominantly bluer than the underlying galaxy population and exhibit a preference for lower density regions analogous to SDSS studies of narrow-line AGN. To probe the environment on smaller physical scales, we determine the fraction of galaxies (M_*&gt;2.5x10^10 Msun) hosting AGNs inside optically-selected groups, and find no significant difference with field galaxies. We interpret our results as evidence that AGN activity requires a sufficient fuel supply; the probability of a massive galaxy to have retained some sufficient amount of gas, as evidence by its ongoing star formation, is higher in underdense regions where disruptive processes (i.e., galaxy harrassment, tidal stripping) are lessened.",Astronomy

I provide examples of each of these positive functions. Negative consequences of the same processes also deserve attention for a balanced picture of the forces at play. I review four such consequences and illustrate them with relevant examples. Recent writings on social capital have extended the concept from an individual asset to a feature of communities and even nations. The final sections describe this conceptual stretch and examine its limitations. I argue that, as shorthand for the positive consequences of sociability, social capital has a definite place in sociological theory. However, excessive extensions of the concept may j...",Sociology
1873,157.0,"In two recent papers, Abramowicz et al. claim that the expansion of the Universe can be interpreted only as the expansion of space. In fact, what they really prove is that the cosmological expansion cannot be described in terms of real motions in Minkowski spacetime. However, there is no controversy about this issue. Abramowicz et al. show that in general, the cosmological redshift is not a Doppler shift and they consider this fact as a proof that space expands. Again, nobody believes (perhaps except Milne) that for non-empty universes the origin of the redshift is purely Dopplerian. From the Principle of Equivalence it follows that there must be also a gravitational shift in presence of matter. Indeed, it is well known in cosmology that for small redshifts, the cosmological redshift can be decomposed into a Doppler component and a gravitational component. In a forthcoming paper, we shall perform such a decomposition for arbitrarily large values of the redshift.",Astronomy

1875,424.0,"This article familiarizes counseling psychologists with qualitative research methods in psychology developed in the tradition of European phenomenology. A brief history includes some of Edmund Husserl’s basic methods and concepts, the adoption of existential-phenomenology among psychologists, and the development and formalization of qualitative research procedures in North America. The choice points and alternatives in phenomenological research in psychology are delineated. The approach is illustrated by a study of a recovery program for persons repeatedly hospitalized for chronic mental illness. Phenomenological research is compared with other qualitative methods, and some of its benefits for counseling psychology are identified. Phenomenology is a qualitative research method originally developed by the philosopher Edmund Husserl. In the tradition of Giambattista Vico, Franz Brentano, and William Dilthey, Husserl broadened the concepts and methods of modern science to include the study of consciousness, profoundly influencing philosophy, other humanities, and the social sciences throughout the 20th century. Husserl formulated scientific methods that are uniquely fashioned to assist psychological researchers in the investigation of human experience and behavior.",Psychology

We find that rather than being received as abstract theory, Bourdieu has been actively put to use to generate new empirical research. In addition, American sociologists have used their findings to problematize and extend his theory. Bourdieu’s sociology, in other words, has inspired a progressive research program in the United States. We trace this process in the two main forums for presenting research: journal articles and books. Content analysis of articles published in four major sociology journals reveals that, far from a recent fad, Bourdieu’s ideas steadily diffused into American sociology between 1980 and 2004. Case studies of four influential books in turn illustrate how researchers have used Bourdieu’s key concepts (capital, field, habitus, and symbolic power) to inform debates in four core subfields (political, economic, cultural, and urban sociology).",Sociology

This paper draws on recent work on the gendering of organisation and bureaucracy to suggest that a key issue for consideration is not so much the exclusion of women from work defined as professional, but rather their routine inclusion in ill-defined support roles. This adjunct work of women, it is argued, facilitates the `fleeting encounter' of professional practice, thereby resting on, and celebrating, a specific historical and cultural construction of masculinity and a masculinist vision of professional work. In an era where professions are under unprecedented public scrutiny, sociological attention to their renewal needs to recognise that a key feature of profession, as presently defined, is that it professes gender.",Sociology

This is the maximal energy of synchrotron photons which can be emitted by an electron having an arbitrarily high initial energy after it turns by angle $\sim \pi$ in the magnetic field. This upper limit can be naturally reached if the converter mechanism contributes to the jet radiation and can be imprinted in spectra of some blazars as a cutoff or a dip in the GeV range. We use numerical simulations to probe the range of parameters of a radiating jet where the ultimate synchrotron cutoff appears. We reproduce the variety of spectra depending on the source luminosity and on the scale of the emission site. We also compare our results with the EGRET blazar spectra in order to illustrate that agreement is possible but still not statistically significant. The predicted feature, if it exists, should be observed by {\it Fermi} in spectra of some blazars.",Astronomy

So an attempt to clarify its significance and scope represents a suitable point of departure for renewed efforts at co-operation between sociologists and economists. Rather than highlighting the limitations and weaknesses of the concept with a view to attacking the limitations and weaknesses of economic theory, I intend to show just how useful it is as a tool for understanding the dynamics of markets, drawing upon sociology as an additional resource. I shall approach this task from the perspective of the sociologist of science and techniques. This will allow me not only to highlight the role of investment-in particular technological-in the emergence of economic agents that are capable of strategies and calculation; it will also serve as an incentive to take the 'performative' role of the sciences-and hence also of economics and sociology-more seriously. I shall start by putting my economist's hat on in order briefly to remind my fellow sociologists of the various ways in which the concept of externality can be defined, together with its practical and theoretical implications. This will lead on to a discussion of the various mechanisms upon which the concept is predicated.

1884,86.0,"Aims:In this study we investigate the evolution of shape and kinematics of elliptical galaxies in a cosmological framework. Methods: We use a set of hydrodynamic, self-consistent simulations operating in the context of a concordance cosmological model where relaxed elliptical-like objects (ELOs) were identified at redshifts z=0, z=0.5, z=1 and z=1.5. Results: The population of elliptical systems analysed here present a systematic change through time, i.e. evolution, by becoming rounder in general at z=0 and, at the same time more velocity dispersion supported. This is found to be primarily due to major dry mergers where only a modest amount of angular momentum is involved into the merger event. Despite the general trend, in a significant amount of cases the merger event involves a higher specific angular momentum, which in general causes the system to acquire a higher rotational support and/or a more oblate shape. These evolutionary patterns are still present when we study our systems in projection, mimicking real observations, and thus they should become apparent in future observations.",Astronomy

Three main traditions appear in economic sociology, which are still fairly unexplored: the German tradition of Wirtschajissoziologie (1890-1930), the French tradition of sociologie economique (1890-1930), and the US tradition of “economy and society” (1950s).

For this purpose, we derive a model for the high-redshift black hole population based on observed relations between the black hole mass and the host galaxy. We re-address previous constraints from the X-ray background with particular focus on black hole luminosities below the Eddington limit as observed in many local AGN. For such luminosities, up to 20% of high-redshift black holes can be active quasars. We then discuss the observables of high-redshift black holes for ALMA and JWST by adopting NGC 1068 as a reference system. We calculate the expected flux of different fine-structure lines for a similar system at higher redshift, and provide further predictions for high-J CO lines. We discuss the expected fluxes from stellar light, the AGN continuum and the Lyman $\alpha$ line for JWST. Line fluxes observed with ALMA can be used to derive detailed properties of high-redshift sources. We suggest two observational strategies to find potential AGN at high redshift and estimate the expected number of sources, which is between 1-10 for ALMA with a field of view of $\sim(1')^2$ searching for line emission and 100-1000 for JWST with a field of view of $(2.16')^2$ searching for continuum radiation.

Thermal emission of large grains or pebbles can be best observed at cm wavelengths. However, other emission mechanisms can contribute. We aim to determine the mechanisms of cm emission for 3 T Tauri stars. WW Cha and RU Lup were recently found to have grain growth at least up to mm sizes in their circumstellar disks. CS Cha has similar indications for grain growth in its circumbinary disk. The T Tauri stars WW Cha and RU Lup were monitored over several years at mm and cm wavelengths, using ATCA. The new ATCA 7 mm system was also used to observe CS Cha. WW Cha was detected on several occasions at 7 and 16 mm. We obtained one detection of WW Cha at 3 cm and upper limits only at 6 cm. The emission at 16 mm was stable over days, months and years, but the emission at 3 cm is found to be variable. RU Lup was detected at 7 mm. It was observed at 16 mm 3 times and at 3 and 6 cm 4 times and found to be variable in all 3 wavebands. CS Cha was detected at 7 mm, but the S/N was too low to resolve the gap in the circumbinary disk. The emission at 3, 7 and 16 mm for WW Cha is well explained by thermal emission from mm and cm-sized pebbles. The cm spectral index is consistent with the emission from an optically-thick ionised wind, but the high variability of the cm emission points to a non-thermal contribution. The SEDs of RU Lup and CS Cha from 1 to 7 mm are consistent with thermal emission from mm-sized grains. The variability of the longer-wavelength emission for RU Lup and the negative spectral index suggest non-thermal emission.",Astronomy

Dr. Wason and Dr. Johnson-Laird are intrigued by the extent to which most individuals can be considered naturally rational thinkers. They present here the surprising results of their comprehensive investigations of how humans draw explicit conclusions from evidence. Given a set of assertions, the authors write, to what extent can the individual appreciate all that follows from them by virtue of logic alone, and remain unseduced by plausible, but fallacious conclusions? We are not concerned with whether these assertions are true or false, nor with whether the individual holds them among his beliefs, nor with whether they are sane or silly. At the core of the Psychology of Reasoning is a vigorous discussion that incorporates various illustrations--some of them humorous, all of them fascinating--of the use of reason under a wide variety of different conditions. Particular emphasis is placed on the difficulties involved in dealing with negatively marked information that must be combined and used with other information for reaching conclusions. Thorough treatment is given as well to the search for plausible contexts that will render anomalous or ambiguous statements sensible.

1894,345.0,"Traditional mechanistic accounts of language processing derive almost entirely from the study of monologue. Yet, the most natural and basic form of language use is dialogue. As a result, these accounts may only offer limited theories of the mechanisms that underlie language processing in general. We propose a mechanistic account of dialogue, the interactive alignment account, and use it to derive a number of predictions about basic language processes. The account assumes that, in dialogue, the linguistic representations employed by the interlocutors become aligned at many levels, as a result of a largely automatic process. This process greatly simplifies production and comprehension in dialogue. After considering the evidence for the interactive alignment model, we concentrate on three aspects of processing that follow from it. It makes use of a simple interactive inference mechanism, enables the development of local dialogue routines that greatly simplify language processing, and explains the origins of self-monitoring in production. We consider the need for a grammatical framework that is designed to deal with language in dialogue rather than monologue, and discuss a range of implications of the account.",Psychology

1902,725.0,"processes. Until this is realized, Buckley maintains, arguments about sociological analysis will remain at the 'sophomoric' level. Peter Medawar, talking about Spencer, has pointed out that philosophers create systems because it gives them a nice warm comfortable feeling inside, and it is easy to see how all existing sociological theory can be knitted into the empty naturalistic metaphysics of systems theory, with the consequent illusions of scientific progress, intellectual omniscience and academic security. But too many analytical and empirical sacrifices are made on the way. First, one set of inferences from the concept of system will not do for all physical, biological and social phenomena. For some, inferences predicting entropy will be all right; for others, and certainly for social systems, inferences predicting the opposite of increasing complexity, heterogeneity and interdependence will be more accurate. Buckley does not make this clear. Second, it will not do to make the simple distinction between open and closed systems. Both types are impossible extremes, and instruments for making finer discriminations in between are required. Third, decisions must be made about what is system and what is environment. Fourth, the muddle in systems analysis over what level of entity is being discussed has to be confronted. Fifth, there must be more logical sophistication about what kinds of explanation are being proferred. Buckley mounts an obscure, elliptical attack on conventional causality, confuses functional and teleological propositions, and yet rejects the former and subscribes to the latter. In so doing he suggests that a system is both the sum of individual purposes and something more than this, but dismisses as irrelevant the question of how individual purposes are generated.

1903,54.0,"We study the details of preheating in an inflationary scenario in which the Standard Model Higgs, strongly non-minimally coupled to gravity, plays the role of the inflaton. We find that the Universe does not reheat immediately through perturbative decays, but rather initiate a complex process in which perturbative and non-perturbative effects are mixed. The Higgs condesate starts oscillating around the minimum of its potential, producing W and Z gauge bosons non-perturbatively, due to violation of the so-called adiabaticity condition. However, during each semi-oscillation, the created gauge bosons completely decay (perturbatively) into fermions. This way, the decay of the gauge bosons prevents the development of parametric resonance, since bosons cannot accummulate significantly at the beginning. However, the energy transferred to the decay products of the bosons is not enough to reheat the universe, so after about a hundred oscillations, the resonance effect will finally dominate over the perturbative decays. Around the same time (or slightly earlier), backreaction from the gauge bosons onto the Higgs condensate will also start to be significant. Soon afterwards, the Universe is filled with the remnant condensate of the Higgs and a non-thermal distribution of Standard Model particles which redshift as radiation, while the Higgs continues to oscillate as a pressureless fluid. We compute the distribution of energy among all the species present at backreaction. From there on until thermalization, the evolution of the system is highly non-linear and non-perturbative, and will require a careful study via numerical simulations.",Astronomy

1908,724.0,"The present paper is an attempt to formulate and illustrate a generalized approach to the theory of social stratification. This field has, in spite of its central importance, been in a notably undeveloped state. The emergence of a highly generalized conceptual scheme in social theory which has elsewhere been traced by the author suggests the possibility of a more thorough theoretical approach than has hitherto been possible. Social stratification, here regarded as the differential ranking of the human individuals who compose a given social system and their treatment as relatively superior or inferior, may be analyzed in terms of the following classification scheme: (i) membership in a kinship unit, (2) personal qualities, (3) achievements, (4) possessions, (5) authority, and (6) power. Social stratification is regarded here as the differential ranking of the human individuals who compose a given social system and their treatment as superior and inferior elative to one another in certain socially important respects. Our first task is to discuss why such differential ranking is considered a really fundamental phenomenon of social systems and what are the respects in which such ranking is important. Ranking is one of many possible bases on which individuals may be differentiated.' It is only in so far as differences are ISome writers (cf. P. A. Sorokin, Social Mobility [New York, I927]) have distinguished what is here referred to as stratification as the ""vertical"" axis of differentiation of individuals from the ""horizontal"" axis. Correspondingly, when individuals change their status in the differentiated system, reference is made to vertical and horizontal mobility. This usage is dangerous. It states the analytical problem in terms of a two-dimensional spatial analogy. On the one hand, because stratification constitutes one important range of differentiation, it does not follow that all others can be satis-",Sociology

Another moment now exists in an array of contradictions inherent in conventional sociological practices and the increasing acceptance and sophistication of narrative work in the human sciences.

1912,218.0,"We present results of combined N-body and three-dimensional reionization calculations to determine the relationship between reionization history and local environment in a volume 1 Gpc/h across and a resolution of about 1 Mpc. We resolve the formation of about 2x10^6 halos of mass greater than ~10^12 Msun at z=0, allowing us to determine the relationship between halo mass and reionization epoch for galaxies and clusters. For our fiducial reionization model, in which reionization begins at z~15 and ends by z~6, we find a strong bias for cluster-size halos to be in the regions which reionized first, at redshifts 10&lt;z&lt;15. Consequently, material in clusters was reionized within relatively small regions, on the order of a few Mpc, implying that all clusters in our calculation were reionized by their own progenitors. Milky Way mass halos were on average reionized later and by larger regions, with a distribution similar to the global one, indicating that low mass halos are relatively uncorrelated with reionization when only their mass is taken as a prior. On average, we find that most halos with mass less than 10^13 Msun were reionized internally, while almost all halos with masses greater than 10^14 Msun were reionized by their own progenitors. We briefly discuss the implications of this work in light of the ""missing satellites"" problem and how this new approach may be extended further.",Astronomy
1913,887.0,"An alarm has been sounded that historical sociology is subverting the theoretical aims of social science. Criticizing an array of widely influential scholars, Kiser and Hechter propose that rational choice theory can avoid the trend toward ""empiricism"" that results from the import of history into sociology. Their position is based on theoretical realism–a radically antipositivist thesis that uses ontological and theoretical postulates to theorize about reality beyond positive appearance. A close examination of theoretical realism casts doubts on the epistemological foundations of rational choice theory. Relational realism, the alternative introduced here, places greater emphasis on the pragmatic elements of explanation, supporting a more relational, causal‐historical, and problem‐driven view of theory. A renewed appreciation of what is defined as Kuhn's historical episte‐mology provides the foundation for evaluating these competing research programs.",Sociology

1915,703.0,"Diagnoses are the classification tools of medicine, and are pivotal in the ways medicine exerts its role in society. Their sociological study is commonly subsumed under the rubrics of medicalisation, history of medicine and theory of disease. Diagnosis is, however, a powerful social tool, with unique features and impacts which deserve their own specific analysis. The process of diagnosis provides the framework within which medicine operates, punctuates the values which medicine espouses, and underlines the authoritative role of both medicine and the doctor. Diagnosis takes place at a salient juncture between illness and disease, patient and doctor, complaint and explanation. Despite calls for its establishment, almost two decades ago (Brown 1990), there is not yet a clear sociology of diagnosis. This paper argues that there should be, and, as a first step, draws together a number of threads of medical sociology that potentially contribute to this proposed sociology of diagnosis, including the place of diagnosis in the institution of medicine, the social framing of disease definitions, the means by which diagnosis confers authority to medicine, and how that authority is challenged. Through this preliminary review, I encourage sociology to consider the specific role of diagnosis in view of establishing a specific sub-disciplinary field.",Sociology
1916,226.0,"We present high resolution 240 and 607 MHz GMRT radio observations, complemented with 74 MHz archival VLA radio observations of the Ophiuchus cluster of galaxies, whose radio mini-halo has been recently detected at 1400 MHz. We also present archival Chandra and XMM-Newton data of the Ophiuchus cluster. Our observations do not show significant radio emission from the mini-halo, hence we present upper limits to the integrated, diffuse non-thermal radio emission of the core of the Ophiuchus cluster. The XMM-Newton observations can be well explained by a two-temperature thermal model with temperatures of ~=1.8 keV and ~=9.0 keV, respectively, which confirms previous results that suggest that the innermost central region of the Ophiuchus cluster is a cooling core. We also used the XMM-Newton data to set up an upper limit to the (non-thermal) X-ray emission from the cluster. The combination of available radio and X-ray data has strong implications for the currently proposed models of the spectral energy distribution (SED) from the Ophiuchus cluster. In particular, a synchrotron+IC model is in agreement with the currently available data, if the average magnetic field is in the range (0.02-0.3) microG. A pure WIMP annihilation scenario can in principle reproduce both radio and X-ray emission, but at the expense of postulating very large boost factors from dark matter substructures, jointly with extremely low values of the average magnetic field. Finally, a scenario where synchrotron and inverse Compton emission arise from PeV electron-positron pairs (via interactions with the CMB), can be ruled out, as it predicts a non-thermal soft X-ray emission that largely exceeds the thermal Bremsstrahlung measured by INTEGRAL.",Astronomy

It combines materials and methods from sociology and economics, law and political science, and social and cultural history in an effort to grasp the preconditions, structures, functions, and inner tensions of this central domain of modern society. As a sphere between civil society and the state, in which critical public discussion of matters of general interest was institutionally guaranteed, the liberal public sphere took shape in the specific historical circumstances of a developing market economy.

Polyculturalism assumes that individuals' relationships to cultures are not categorical but rather are partial and plural; it also assumes that cultural traditions are not independent, sui generis lineages but rather are interacting systems. Individuals take influences from multiple cultures and thereby become conduits through which cultures can affect each other. Past literatures on the influence of multiple cultural identities and cultural knowledge legacies can be better understood within a polyculturalist rubric. Likewise, the concept elucidates how cultures are changed by contact with other cultures, enabling richer psychological theories of intercultural influence.

Imaged dust continuum emission at 870 micron reveals significant linear polarization. The position angles (PAs) of the polarization vary enormously but smoothly in a region of 2x10^4 AU. Based on the distribution of the PAs and the associated structures, the polarized emission can be separated roughly into two components. The component ""x"" is associated with a well defined dust ridge at 870 micron, and is likely tracing a compressed B field. The component ""o"" is located at the periphery of the dust ridge and is probably from the original B field associated with a pre-existing extended structure. The global B field morphology in G5.89, as inferred from the PAs, is clearly disturbed by the expansion of the HII region and the molecular outflows. Using the Chandrasekhar-Fermi method, we estimate from the smoothness of the field structures that the B field strength in the plane of sky can be no more than 2-3 mG. We then compare the energy densities in the radiation, the B field, and the mechanical motions as deduced from the C^17O 3-2 line emission.

We compare the predictions of the GALFORM semi-analytical galaxy formation model for the luminosities, morphologies, colours and scale-lengths of local galaxies. GALFORM models the luminosity and size of the disk and bulge components of a galaxy, and so we can compute quantities which can be compared directly with SDSS observations, such as the Petrosian magnitude and the Sersic index. We test the predictions of two published models set in the cold dark matter cosmology: the Baugh et al. (2005) model, which assumes a top-heavy initial mass function (IMF) in starbursts and superwind feedback, and the Bower et al. (2006) model, which uses AGN feedback and a standard IMF. The Bower et al model better reproduces the overall shape of the luminosity function, the morphology-luminosity relation and the colour bimodality observed in the SDSS data, but gives a poor match to the size-luminosity relation. The \Baugh et al. model successfully predicts the size-luminosity relation for late-type galaxies. Both models fail to reproduce the sizes of bright early-type galaxies. These problems highlight the need to understand better both the role of feedback processes in determining galaxy sizes, in particular the treatment of the angular momentum of gas reheated by supernovae, and the sizes of the stellar spheroids formed by galaxy mergers and disk instabilities.",Astronomy

The combination results in 836 eclipsing binaries that display coronal activity and is the largest sample of active binary stars assembled to date. By using the (V-I) colors of the ASAS eclipsing binary catalogue, we are able to determine the distances and thus bolometric luminosities for the majority of eclipsing binaries that display significant stellar activity. A typical value for the ratio of soft X-ray to bolometric luminosity is L_X/L_bol ~ a few x 10^-4, similar to the ratio of soft X-ray to bolometric flux F_X/F_bol in the most active regions of the Sun. Unlike rapidly rotating isolated late-type dwarfs -- stars with significant outer convection zones -- a tight correlation between Rossby number and activity of eclipsing binaries is absent.

1942,66.0,"We consider the luminosity and environmental dependence of structural parameters of lenticular galaxies in the near-infrared K band. Using a two-dimensional galaxy image decomposition technique, we extract bulge and disk structural parameters for a sample of 36 lenticular galaxies observed by us in the K band. By combining data from the literature for field and cluster lenticulars with our data, we study correlations between parameters that characterise the bulge and the disk as a function of luminosity and environment. We find that scaling relations such as the Kormendy relation, photometric plane and other correlations involving bulge and disk parameters show a luminosity dependence. This dependence can be explained in terms of galaxy formation models in which faint lenticulars (M_T &gt; -24.5) formed via secular formation processes that likely formed the pseudobulges of late-type disk galaxies, while brighter lenticulars (M_T &lt; -24.5) formed through a different formation mechanism most likely involving major mergers. On probing variations in lenticular properties as a function of environment, we find that faint cluster lenticulars show systematic differences with respect to faint field lenticulars.

1944,645.0,"Sociology of religion represents the various theories and methodologies through which the relationship between religion and social science is explicated. Although relatively new in the academy, the field came to prominence through the work of Durkheim and Weber as they sought to account for the role and meaning of the church in producing and sustaining social networks, social relations as well as norms related to beliefs. Most commentators in religion, theology and sociology today will trace the sociology of religion to the early 1900s, with specific reference to the social theories that saw religion as shared symbols that informs and shapes the moral order within society. Despite the fact that much of sociology of religion, historically rests on sociological theories about protestant Christian orthodoxy, people’s affiliation and participation in the church as a social institution, the relation of social science to religion’s companion discipline, theology, has generally been marked by suspicion and ambivalence. In the same year that Durkheim published his Elementary Forms of Religion, American theologian Guy Talbot (1915) published an essay titled “the relation between sociology and theology” that was driven by one basic questions: What level of sociological knowledge is required to shape Christian practice? Talbot’s reticence is palpable and signals the ambivalence and suspicion that would for the next 100 years characterize the relationship between theology and sociology. Despite some laudable attempts to see what sociology has to offer theology (Gill 1978; Marty 1981; Martin, Mills, and Pickering 2003), theologians, have largely remained cautious about permitting sociological knowledge too much space in determining Christian social practice. Notwithstanding theology’s apparent ambivalence towards social science, faith communities have generally relied on sociological analysis to craft political, environmental, and developmental theologies – such as black theology in the USA and South Africa, liberation theology in South America, and dalit theology in India. Although these Christian traditions operate within a neo-Weberian paradigm in that it imagines religion as coupled with national moral interests, they nonetheless represent a break with theology’s suspicion of social science insofar as they significantly rely on Marxian analysis to show that God is on the side of the poor. Recently, practical theology has assumed similarly reflexive and critical postures as a discipline (Osmer 2011; Lartey 2012), and increasingly look toward sociology of religion as a sub-discipline to collaborate with. If practical theology draws on sociology of religion for expanding its theoretical and methodological repertoires, it cannot rely on traditional sociological assumption about religion as either in decline or thriving in late modernity.

The wide-spread ionization implies that a significant fraction of the Lyman continuum photons from O stars, produced primarily in isolated star forming regions near the midplane and often surrounded by opaque clouds of neutral hydrogen, is somehow able to propagate large distances through the disk and into the halo. Moreover, even though O stars are the source of the ionization, the temperature and ionization state of the WIM differ significantly from what is observed in the classical O star H II regions. Therefore, the existence of the WIM and observations of its properties provide information about the structure of the interstellar medium and the transport of energy away from the midplane as well as place significant constraints on models.",Astronomy
1949,943.0,"One of the main obstacles to scientific sociology is the use we make of common oppositions, paired concepts, or what Bachelard calls ""epistemological couples:"" constructed by social reality, these are unthinkingly used to construct social reality. One of these fundamental antinomies is the opposition between objectivism and subjectivism or, in more current parlance, between structuralism and constructivism, which can be roughly characterized as follows. From the objectivist point of view, social agents can be ""treated as things,"" as in the old Durkheimian precept, that is, classified like objects: access to the objective classification presupposes here a break with naive subjective classifications, which are seen as ""prenotions"" or ""ideologies."" From the subjectivist point of view, as represented by phenomenology, ethnomethodology and constructivist sociology, agents construct social reality, which is itself understood as the product of the aggregation of these individual acts of construction. For this sort of sociological marginalism, there is no need to break with primary social experience, for the task of sociology is to give ""an",Sociology
1950,976.0,"Emotion has long been recognized in sociology as crucially important, but most references to it are generalized and vague. In this essay, I nominate shame, specifically, as the premier social emotion. First I review the individualized treatment of shame in psychoanalysis and psychology, and the absence of social context. Then I consider the contributions to the social dimensions of shame by six sociologists (Georg Simmel, Charles Cooley, Norbert Elias, Richard Sennett, Helen Lynd, Erving Goffman) and a psychologist/psychoanalyst (Helen Lewis). I show that Cooley and Lynd, particularly, made contributions to a theory of shame and the social bond. Lewis's idea that shame arises from threats to the bond integrates the contributions of all six sociologists, and points toward future research on emotion, conflict, and alienation/integration.",Sociology
1951,965.0,"This paper considers sociological understandings of what constitutes disability. Current meanings of disability in both disability studies and medical sociology are examined and compared, using selected articles from leading authors in each discipline as case studies. These disciplines are often represented as offering starkly contrasting approaches to disability, with their differences amounting to a disciplinary 'divide'. It is argued that, on closer inspection, common ground can be found between some writers in disability studies and medical sociology. It is suggested that this situation has arisen because, in disability studies, the social relational understanding of disability developed by Vic Finkelstein and Paul Hunt in the 1970s has been lost over time, overshadowed by the rise to prominence of its offspring: the social model of disability. The paper concludes with some reflections on the need to revive a social relational understanding of disability.",Sociology

The goal of this review is to provide an accessible understanding of why this approach is important for future practice given its potential to augment decisions associated with the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of people suffering from mental illness using clinical and biological data. To this end, the limitations of current statistical paradigms in mental health research are critiqued, and an introduction is provided to critical machine learning methods used in clinical studies. A selective literature review is then presented aiming to reinforce the usefulness of machine learning methods and provide evidence of their potential. In the context of promising initial results, the current limitations of machine learning approaches are addressed, and considerations for future clinical translation are outlined.",Psychology

We show that a V228 binary system may be formed starting with an initial binary system which has a low main sequence star as an accretor. The initial parameters for the evolutionary model are as follow: $M_{1,i} = 0.88 M_\odot $, $M_{2,i} = 0.85 M_\odot $, $P_i=1.35 $days, $f_1$=0.05, $f_2$=4.65 and Z=0.006 ([Fe/H]=--0.67).

1954,183.0,"We present an updated version of MegaZ-LRG (Collister et al.,(2007)) with photometric redshifts derived with the neural network method, ANNz as well as five other publicly available photo-z codes (HyperZ, SDSS, Le PHARE, BPZ and ZEBRA) for ~1.5 million Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs) in SDSS DR6. This allows us to identify how reliable codes are relative to each other if used as described in their public release. We compare and contrast the relative merits of each code using ~13000 spectroscopic redshifts from the 2SLAQ sample. We find that the performance of each code depends on the figure of merit used to assess it. As expected, the availability of a complete training set means that the training method performs best in the intermediate redshift bins where there are plenty of training objects. Codes such as Le PHARE, which use new observed templates perform best in the lower redshift bins. All codes produce reasonable photometric redshifts, the 1-sigma scatters ranging from 0.057 to 0.097 if averaged over the entire redshift range. We also perform tests to check whether a training set from a small region of the sky such as 2SLAQ produces biases if used to train over a larger area of the sky. We conclude that this is not likely to be a problem for future wide-field surveys.

1955,291.0,"Utilizing deep Hubble Space Telescope imaging from the two largest field galaxy surveys, the Extended Groth Strip (EGS) and the COSMOS survey, we examine the structural properties, and derive the merger history for 21,902 galaxies with M_*&gt;10^{10} M_0 at z&lt;1.2. We examine the structural CAS parameters of these galaxies, deriving merger fractions, at 0.2&lt;z&lt;1.2, based on the asymmetry and clumpiness values of these systems. We find that the merger fraction between z=0.2 and z=1.2 increases from roughly f_m=0.04+/-0.01 to f_m=0.13+/-0.01. We explore several fitting formalisms for parameterising the merger fraction, and compare our results to other structural studies and pair methods within the DEEP2, VVDS, and COSMOS fields. We also re-examine our method for selecting mergers, and the inherent error budget and systematics associated with identifying mergers using structure. For galaxies selected by M_*&gt;10^{10} M_0, the merger fraction can be parameterised by f_m = f_0*(1+z)^m with the power-law slope m=2.3+/-0.4. By using the best available z = 0 prior the slope increases to m=3.8+/-0.2, showing how critical the measurement of local merger properties are for deriving the evolution of the merger fraction. We furthermore show that the merger fraction derived through structure is roughly a factor of 3-6 higher than pair fractions. Based on the latest cosmological simulations of mergers we show that this ratio is predicted, and that both methods are likely tracing the merger fraction and rate properly. We calculate, utilising merger time scales from simulations, and previously published merger fractions that the merger rate of galaxies with M_*&gt;10^{10} M_0 increases linearly between z = 0.7 and z = 3, and that a typical M_*&gt;10^{10} M_0 galaxy undergoes between 1-2 major mergers at z&lt;1.2.",Astronomy
1956,455.0,"Statistical inference in psychology has traditionally relied heavily on p-value significance testing. This approach to drawing conclusions from data, however, has been widely criticized, and two types of remedies have been advocated. The first proposal is to supplement p values with complementary measures of evidence, such as effect sizes. The second is to replace inference with Bayesian measures of evidence, such as the Bayes factor. The authors provide a practical comparison of p values, effect sizes, and default Bayes factors as measures of statistical evidence, using 855 recently published t tests in psychology. The comparison yields two main results. First, although p values and default Bayes factors almost always agree about what hypothesis is better supported by the data, the measures often disagree about the strength of this support; for 70% of the data sets for which the p value falls between .01 and .05, the default Bayes factor indicates that the evidence is only anecdotal. Second, effect sizes can provide additional evidence to p values and default Bayes factors. The authors conclude that the Bayesian approach is comparatively prudent, preventing researchers from overestimating the evidence in favor of an effect.",Psychology

1958,674.0,"This paper proposes a re-thinking of the relationship between sociology and the biological sciences. Tracing lines of connection between the history of sociology and the contemporary landscape of biology, the paper argues for a reconfiguration of this relationship beyond popular rhetorics of 'biologization' or 'medicalization'. At the heart of the paper is a claim that, today, there are some potent new frames for re-imagining the traffic between sociological and biological research - even for 'revitalizing' the sociological enterprise as such. The paper threads this argument through one empirical case: the relationship between urban life and mental illness. In its first section, it shows how this relationship enlivened both early psychiatric epidemiology, and some forms of the new discipline of sociology; it then traces the historical division of these sciences, as the sociological investment in psychiatric questions waned, and 'the social' become marginalized within an increasingly 'biological' psychiatry. In its third section, however, the paper shows how this relationship has lately been revivified, but now by a nuanced epigenetic and neurobiological attention to the links between mental health and urban life. What role can sociology play here? In its final section, the paper shows how this older sociology, with its lively interest in the psychiatric and neurobiological vicissitudes of urban social life, can be our guide in helping to identify intersections between sociological and biological attention. With a new century now underway, the paper concludes by suggesting that the relationship between urban life and mental illness may prove a core testing-ground for a 'revitalized' sociology.",Sociology
1959,422.0,"Because psychology systematically explores human judgment, behavior, and well-being, it can teach us important facts about how humans differ from traditional economic assumptions. In this essay I discuss a selection of psychological findings relevant to economics. Standard economics assumes that each person has stable, well-defined preferences, and that she rationally maximizes those preferences. Section 2 considers what psychological research teaches us about the true form of preferences, allowing us to make economics more realistic within the rational-choice framework. Section 3 reviews research on biases in judgment under uncertainty; because those biases lead people to make systematic errors in their attempts to maximize their preferences, thi s research poses a more radical challenge to the economics model. The array of psychological findings reviewed in Section 4 points to an even more radical critique of the economics model: Even if we are willing to modify our familiar assumptions about p references, or allow that people make systematic errors in their attempts to maximize those preferences, it is sometimes misleading to conceptualize people as attempting to maximize well-defined coherent, or stable preferences.",Psychology

They propose 7 rules of eye to guide the inferential use of figures with error bars.

We find an excellent correlation between the IR, optical, UV and gamma-ray light curves, with a time lag of less than one day. The amplitude of the infrared variability is comparable to that in gamma-rays, and larger than at optical or UV wavelengths. The X-ray flux is not strongly correlated with either the gamma-rays or longer wavelength data. These variability characteristics find a natural explanation in the external Compton model, in which electrons with Lorentz factor gamma~10^(3-4) radiate synchrotron emission in the infrared-optical and also scatter accretion disk or emission line photons to gamma-ray energies, while much cooler electrons (gamma~10^(1-2)) produce X-rays by scattering synchrotron or other ambient photons.",Astronomy

Reckless conduct, an intermediate case, provokes reactions that involve elements of both careless and intentional harm.

Measuring such subjective data as reactions to color, heat, light, and sound would seem to be an almost impossible task; indeed, until now there has been no theory around which the research in this field could be organized. This volume represents a preliminary effort to identify the relevant variables involved and fit them into a systematic framework. Furthermore, it presents extensive sets of measures for investigating the theory and implementing it in a variety of everyday environments.Basically, the framework outlined here proposes that environmental stimuli are linked to behavioral responses by the primary emotional responses of arousal, pleasure, and dominance. By considering the impact of the environment on these basic emotional responses, the effects of diverse stimulus components within or across sense modalities can be readily compared. An additional concept, information rate, is used to compare the effects of different environments, each with stimulation in many sense modalities. In the final chapters the authors present a series of hypotheses which relate the emotional response variables to a diversity of behaviors such as physical approach, performance, affiliation, and verbally or nonverbally expressed preference.",Psychology

There are two sources, VLA 1 (=IRAS 05491+0247) and VLA 2, with the VLA 1 source driving the HH 111 jet. Thermal emission is seen in 1.33 mm continuum tracing the dust in the envelope and the putative disks around the sources. A flattened, torus-like envelope is seen in C18O and 13CO around the VLA 1 source surrounding the dust lane perpendicular to the jet axis, with an inner radius of ~ 400 AU (1""), an outer radius of ~ 3200 AU (8""), and a thickness of ~ 1000 AU (2.5""). It seems to be infalling toward the center with conservation of specific angular momentum rather than with a Keplerian rotation as assumed by Yang et al. 1997. An inner envelope is seen in SO, with a radius of ~ 500 AU (1.3""). The inner part of this inner envelope, which is spatially coincident with the dust lane, seems to have a differential rotation and thus may have formed a rotationally supported disk. The outer part of this inner envelope, however, may have a rotation velocity decreasing toward the center and thus represent a region where an infalling envelope is in transition to a rotationally supported disk.

He shows that sociology is indeed an art form, one that has a strong kinship with literature, painting, Romantic history, and philosophy in the nineteenth century, the age in which sociology came into full stature. Sociology as an Art Form is an introduction for the initiated and the uninitiated in so-ciology. Nisbet explains the degree to which sociology draws from the same creative impulses, themes and styles (rooted in history), and actual modes of representa-tion found in the arts. He shows how the founding sociologists such as Marx, Weber, Durkheim, and Simmel constructed portraits (of the bourgeois, the worker, and the intellectual) and landscapes (of the masses, the poor, the factory system), all reflecting and contribut-ing to identical portraits and landscapes found in the literature and art of the period. In addition to marking the similarities between sociologists' and artists' efforts to depict motion or movement, Nisbet emphasizes the relation of sociology to the fin de siecle in art and literature, with examples such as alienation, anomie, and degeneration. He creates an elegant, brilliantly reasoned appraisal of sociology's contribution to modern culture.

The aim of this paper is to demonstrate how the body might be integrated into sociological accounts of the experience of chronic illness in a way that acknowledges biological and social facts. Central to our argument is the connection between bodily aspects of self and identity. Self and identity are core aspects of everyday experience and of the everyday experience of illness. With the onset of illness bodily functioning alters and self-conceptions and identity may also change. The body, which in many social situations is a taken for granted aspect of the person, ceases to be taken for granted once it malfunctions. The bodily basis of chronic illness has to be attended to because it limits or interferes with other physical and social activities. The connection between biological and social facts is explored using the concepts of self and identity.",Sociology
1981,136.0,"We present a complete analysis of the cosmological constraints on decaying dark matter. Previous analyses have used the cosmic microwave background and Type Ia supernova. We have updated them with the latest data as well as extended the analysis with the inclusion of Lyman-$\alpha$ forest, large scale structure and weak lensing observations. Astrophysical constraints are not considered in the present paper. The bounds on the lifetime of decaying dark matter are dominated by either the late-time integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect for the scenario with weak reionization, or CMB polarization observations when there is significant reionization. For the respective scenarios, the lifetimes for decaying dark matter are $\Gamma^{-1} \gtrsim 100$ Gyr and $ (f \Gamma) ^{-1} \gtrsim 5.3 \times 10^8$ Gyr (at 95.4% confidence level), where the phenomenological parameter $f$ is the fraction of the decay energy deposited in baryonic gas. This allows us to constrain particle physics models with dark matter candidates through investigation of dark matter decays into Standard Model particles via effective operators. For decaying dark matter of $\sim 100$ GeV mass, we found that the size of the coupling constant in the effective dimension-4 operators responsible for dark matter decay has to generically be $ \lesssim 10^{-22}$. We have also explored the implications of our analysis for representative models in theories of gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking, minimal supergravity and little Higgs.",Astronomy
1982,217.0,"A white dwarf (WD) approaching the Chandrasekhar mass may in several cases undergo accretion-induced collapse (AIC) to a neutron star (NS) before a thermonuclear explosion ensues. It has generally been assumed that AIC does not produce a detectable supernova (SN). If, however, the progenitor WD is rapidly rotating (as may be expected due to its prior accretion), a centrifugally supported disk forms around the NS upon collapse. We calculate the subsequent evolution of this accretion disk using time-dependent height-integrated simulations with initial conditions taken from the AIC calculations of Dessart et al. (2006). Initially, the disk is cooled by neutrinos and its composition is driven neutron-rich (electron fraction Ye ~ 0.1) by electron captures. However, as the disk viscously spreads, it is irradiated by neutrinos from the central proto-NS, which dramatically alters its neutron-to-proton ratio. We find that electron neutrino captures increase Ye to ~ 0.5 by the time that weak interactions in the disk freeze out. Because the disk becomes radiatively inefficient and begins forming alpha-particles soon after freeze out, powerful winds blow away most of the disk's remaining mass. These Ye ~ 0.5 outflows synthesize up to a few times 1e-2 Msun in 56Ni. As a result, AIC may be accompanied by a radioactively powered SN-like transient that peaks on a timescale of ~ 1 day. Since few intermediate mass elements are likely synthesized, these Ni-rich explosions should be spectroscopically distinct from other SNe. PanSTARRs and the Palomar Transient Factory should detect a few AIC transients per year if their true rate is ~1/100 of the Type Ia rate, and LSST should detect hundreds per year. High cadence observations (&lt; 1 day) are optimal for the detection and follow-up of AIC (abridged).",Astronomy

It is practically independent of the details of neutrino transport in the opaque zone of the disk. The results help identify the accretion disks whose neutrino emission can power GRBs.",Astronomy
1987,586.0,"In a choice among assured, familiar outcomes of behavior, impulsiveness is the choice of less rewarding over more rewarding alternatives. Discussions of impulsiveness in the literature of economics, sociology, social psychology, dynamic psychology and psychiatry, behavioral psychology, and ""behavior therapy"" are reviewed. 'Impulsiveness seems to be best accounted for by the hyberbolic curves that have been found to describe the decline in effectiveness of rewards as the rewards are delayed from the time of choice. Such curves predict a reliable change of choice between some alternative rewards as a function of time. This change of choice provides a rationale for the known kinds of impulse control and relates them to several hitherto perplexing phenomena: behavioral rigidity, time-out from positive reinforcement, willpower, self-reward, compulsive traits, projection, boredom, and the capacity of punishing stimuli to attract attention.",Psychology
1988,166.0,"We present images from a long term program (MOJAVE: Monitoring of Jets in AGN with VLBA Experiments) to survey the structure and evolution of parsec-scale jet phenomena associated with bright radio-loud active galaxies in the northern sky. The observations consist of 2424 15 GHz VLBA images of a complete flux-density limited sample of 135 AGN above declination -20 degrees, spanning the period 1994 August to 2007 September. These data were acquired as part of the MOJAVE and 2 cm Survey programs, and from the VLBA archive. The sample selection criteria are based on multi-epoch parsec-scale (VLBA) flux density, and heavily favor highly variable and compact blazars. The sample includes nearly all the most prominent blazars in the northern sky, and is well-suited for statistical analysis and comparison with studies at other wavelengths. Our multi-epoch and stacked-epoch images show 94% of the sample to have apparent one-sided jet morphologies, most likely due to the effects of relativistic beaming. Of the remaining sources, five have two-sided parsec-scale jets, and three are effectively unresolved by the VLBA at 15 GHz, with essentially all of the flux density contained within a few tenths of a milliarcsecond.",Astronomy

An important development in this context is D. P. McAdams's life story model of identity (1985, 1993, 1996), which asserts that people living in modern societies provide their lives with unity and purpose by constructing internalized and evolving narratives of the self. The idea that identity is a life story resonates with a number of important themes in developmental, cognitive, personality, and cultural psychology.

1993,820.0,"This article suggests that American sociology has developed a de facto tradition in the sociology of the marked that devotes greater epistemological attention to “politically salient” and “ontologically uncommon” features of social life. Although the “unmarked” comprises the vast majority of social life, the “marked” commands a disproportionate share of attention from sociologists. Since the marked already draws more attention within the general culture, social scientists contribute to re-marking and the reproduction of common-sense images of social reality. This has important analytic consequences. This article argues for developing a stronger tradition in a sociology of the unmarked that explicitly foregrounds “politically unnoticed” and taken-for-granted elements of social reality. Three strategies are proposed toward this end: (1) reversing conventional patterns of markedness to foreground what typically remains unnamed and implicit, (2) marking everything by filling in all the shades of social continua so that each shares the same degree of epistemological ornamentation, and (3) developing an analytically nomadic perspective that observes social phenomena from multiple vantage points.",Sociology

1995,81.0,"Using the sample of long Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) detected by Swift-BAT before June 2007, we measure the cumulative distribution of the peak photon fluxes (log N - log P) of the Swift bursts. Compared with the BATSE sample, we find that the two distributions are consistent after correcting the band pass difference, suggesting that the two instruments are sampling the same population of bursts. We also compare the log N - log P distributions for sub-samples of the Swift bursts, and find evidence for a deficit (99.75% confident) of dark bursts without optical counterparts at high peak flux levels, suggesting different redshift or Gamma-ray luminosity distributions for these bursts. The consistency between the log N - log P distributions for the optically detected bursts with and without redshift measurements indicates that the current sample of the Swift bursts with redshift measurements, although selected heterogeneously, represents a fair sample of the non-dark bursts. We calculate the luminosity functions of this sample in two redshift bins (z&lt;1 and z&gt;1), and find a broken power-law is needed to fit the low redshift bin, where dN/dL \propto L^{-1.27\pm0.06} for high luminosities (L_{peak} &gt; 5e48 erg/s) and dN/dL \propto L^{-2.3\pm0.3} at for low luminosities, confirming the results of several studies for a population of low luminosity GRBs.",Astronomy

Second, the issues raised with respect to functionalism, except insofar as they spring from the ambiguities of words like ""function,"" are really the basic issues or questions of sociological theory. Third, historically the rise of functionalism represented a revolt against reductionist theories, anti-theoretical empiricism, and moralistic or ideological views under the name of sociology or social anthropology. Although functionalism may have been salutary at the time it arose, the ambiguities of its special terminology make the myth that it is a special method a liability now.

In particular, many of these stars were monitored continuously during several seasons by IUE. Aims. Our main purpose is to study the short and long-term chromospheric activity of the RS CVn systems most observed by IUE: HD 22468 (V711 Tau, HR 1099, K1IV+G5V), HD 21242 (UX Ari, K0IV+G5V) and HD 224085 (II Peg, K2IV). Methods. We first obtain the Mount Wilson index S from the IUE high and low-resolution spectra. Secondly, we analyse with the Lomb-Scargle periodogram the mean annual index S and the amplitude of its rotational modulation. Results. For HD 22468 (V711 Tau, HR 1099), we found a possible chromospheric cycle with a period of 18 years and a shorter cycle with a period of 3 years, which could be associated to a chromospheric ""flip-flop"" cycle. The data of HD 224085 (II Peg) also suggest a chromospheric cycle of 21 years and a flip-flop cycle of 9 years.

2000,863.0,"One of the obstacles to a scientific sociology of sport is due to the fact that sociologists of sport are in a way doubly dominated, both in the world of sociologists and in the world of sport. Since it would take too long to develop this somewhat blunt proposition, I will proceed, in the manner of the prophets, by way of a parable. In a recent discussion with one of my American sociologist friends, Aaron Cicourel, I learned that the great black athletes, who, in the United States, are often enrolled in such prestigious universities as Stanford, live in a sort of golden ghetto, because right-wing people do not talk very willingly with blacks while left-wing people do not talk very willingly with athletes. If one reflects on this and develops this paradigm, one might find in it the principle of the special difficulties that the sociology of sport encounters: scorned by sociologists, it is despised by sportspersons. The logic of the social division of labor tends to reproduce itself in the division of scientific labor. Thus there are, on the one hand, those who know sport very well on a practical level but do not know how to talk about it and, on the other hand, those who know sport very poorly on a practical level and who could talk about it, but disdain doing so, or do so without rhyme or reason. In order to be able to constitute a sociology of sport, one must first realize that a particular sport cannot be analyzed independently of the totality of sporting practices; one must conceptualize the space of sporting practices as a system within which each element receives its distinctive value. In other words, to understand a sport, whatever it may be, one must locate its position in the space of sports. The latter can be constructed by using sets of indicators such as, on the one hand, the distribution of practitioners according to their position in social space, the distribution of the different federations according to their number of members, their assets, the social characteristics of their directors, etc., or, on the other hand, the type of relation to the body that each sport favors or demands, whether it involves direct contact, body-to-body struggle, as in wrestling or Ameri-",Sociology
2001,550.0,"Among the many traditions of research on ""identity,"" two somewhat different yet strongly related strands of identity theory have developed. The first, reflected in the work of Stryker and colleagues, focuses on the linkages of social structures with identities. The second, reflected in the work of Burke and colleagues, focuses on the internal process of self-verification. In the present paper we review each of these strands and then discuss ways in which the two relate to and complement one another Each provides a context for the other: the relation of social structures to identities influences the process of self-verification, while the process of self-verification creates and sustains social structures. The paper concludes with examples of potentially useful applications of identity theory to other arenas of social psychology, and with a discussion of challenges that identity theory must meet to provide a clear understanding of the relation between self and society. The language of ""identity"" is ubiquitous in contemporary social science, cutting across psychoanalysis, psychology, political science, sociology, and history. The common usage of the term identity, however, belies the considerable variability in both its conceptual meanings and its theoretical role. Even when consideration is restricted to sociology and social psychology, variation is still considerable.'",Psychology
2002,234.0,"In the next years, several cosmological surveys will rely on imaging data to estimate the redshift of galaxies, using traditional filter systems with 4-5 optical broad bands; narrower filters improve the spectral resolution, but strongly reduce the total system throughput. We explore how photometric redshift performance depends on the number of filters n_f, characterizing the survey depth through the fraction of galaxies with unambiguous redshift estimates. For a combination of total exposure time and telescope imaging area of 270 hrs m^2, 4-5 filter systems perform significantly worse, both in completeness depth and precision, than systems with n_f &gt;= 8 filters. Our results suggest that for low n_f, the color-redshift degeneracies overwhelm the improvements in photometric depth, and that even at higher n_f, the effective photometric redshift depth decreases much more slowly with filter width than naively expected from the reduction in S/N. Adding near-IR observations improves the performance of low n_f systems, but still the system which maximizes the photometric redshift completeness is formed by 9 filters with logarithmically increasing bandwidth (constant resolution) and half-band overlap, reaching ~0.7 mag deeper, with 10% better redshift precision, than 4-5 filter systems. A system with 20 constant-width, non-overlapping filters reaches only ~0.1 mag shallower than 4-5 filter systems, but has a precision almost 3 times better, dz = 0.014(1+z) vs. dz = 0.042(1+z).

2003,688.0,"The social relevance of perspective established in the sociology of knowledge becomes evident during times of great social change and conflict. Conflict makes for a total functionalizing of thought which is interpreted only in terms of its alleged social, economic, political, or psychological sources and functions. Deepened social conflict today renews the relevance of an old problem in the sociology of knowledge: socially patterned differentials in access to new knowledge. As groups and collectivities become more self-conscious and solidary under conditions of social polarization, their members tend to claim unique or privileged access to certain kinds of knowledge. This can be described as the doctrine of the Insider, which includes the correlative claim that the Outsider has a structurally imposed incapacity for access to such knowledge. Outsider doctrine involves complementary claims of access to knowledge grounded on the assumption of socially based detachment. The rationale of the Insider doctrine is examined, with special references to the advocates of a ""black social science,"" a case taken as prototypical for other Insider doctrines based on sex, age, religion, nationality, etc. Structural analysis in terms of status sets indicates that Insider and Outsider doctrines based on affiliation with a single collectivity or occupancy of a single status are necessarily unstable and inadequate. The paper concludes by examining the distinctive interactive roles of Insiders and Outsiders that involve interchange, tradeoffs, and syntheses in the formation of social knowledge.",Sociology

The present studies investigated the possibility that assessment of confidence is biased by attempts to justify one's chosen answer. These attempts include selectively focusing on evidence supporting the chosen answer and disregarding evidence contradicting it. Experiment 1 presented subjects with two-alternative questions and required them to list reasons for and against each of the alternatives prior to choosing an answer and assessing the probability of its being correct. This procedure produced a marked improvement in the appropriateness of confidence judgments. Experiment 2 simplified the manipulation by asking subjects first to choose an answer and then to list (a) one reason supporting that choice, (b) one reason contradicting it, or (c) one reason supporting and one reason contradicting. Only the listing of contradicting reasons improved the appropriateness of confidence. Correlational analyses of the data of Experiment 1 strongly suggested that the confidence depends on the amount and strength of the evidence supporting the answer chosen.",Psychology

2006,782.0,"AbstractIn this review, we explore how the concept of embeddedness has shaped—and been shaped by—the evolution of the subfield of economic sociology. Although embeddedness is often taken as a conceptual umbrella for a single, if eclectic, approach to the sociological study of the economy, we argue that in fact the concept references two distinct intellectual projects. One project, following from Granovetter's (1985) well-known programmatic statement, attempts to discern the relational bases of social action in economic contexts. Another project, drawing from Polanyi's [1944 (2001), 1957, 1977] social theory, concerns the integration of the economy into broader social systems. Critically, these two formulations of embeddedness involve different views of the relationship between the economic and the social. The implication is that the obstacles to theoretical integration in economic sociology, while not insurmountable, are greater than is typically acknowledged.",Sociology
2007,265.0,"We present high angular resolution observations of HC$_3$N J=5--4 line and 7 mm continumm emission from the extreme carbon star CIT 6. We find that the 7 mm continuum emission is unresolved and has a flux consistent with black-body thermal radiation from the central star. The HC$_3$N J=5--4 line emission originates from an asymmetric and clumpy expanding envelope comprising two separate shells of HC$_3$N J=5--4 emission: (i) a faint outer shell that is nearly spherical which has a radius of 8\arcsec; and (ii) a thick and incomplete inner shell that resembles a one-arm spiral starting at or close to the central star and extending out to a radius of about 5\arcsec. Our observations therefore suggest that the mass loss from CIT 6 is strongly modulated with time and highly anisotropic. Furthermore, a comparison between the data and our excitation modelling results suggests an unusually high abundance of HC$_3$N in its envelope. We discuss the possibility that the envelope might be shaped by the presence of a previously suggested possible binary companion. The abundance of HC$_3$N may be enhanced in spiral shocks produced by the interaction between the circumstellar envelope of CIT 6 and its companion star.",Astronomy
2008,413.0,"There has been a rapid growth in positive psychology, a research and intervention approach that focuses on promoting optimal functioning and well-being. Positive psychology interventions are now making their way into classrooms all over the world. However, positive psychology has been criticized for being decontextualized and coercive, and for putting an excessive emphasis on positive states, whilst failing to adequately consider negative experiences. Given this, how should policy be used to regulate and evaluate these interventions? We review evidence that suggests these criticisms may be valid, but only for those interventions that focus almost exclusively on changing the content of people’s inner experience (e.g., make it more positive) and personality (improving character strength), and overemphasize the idea that inner experience causes action. We describe a contextualized form of positive psychology that not only deals with the criticisms, but also has clear policy implications for how to best implement and evaluate positive education programs so that they do not do more harm than good.",Psychology
2009,194.0,"The eclipsing and double-lined spectroscopic binary system V453 Cygni consists of two early B-type stars, one of which is nearing the terminal age main sequence and one which is roughly halfway through its main sequence lifetime. Accurate measurements of the masses and radii of the two stars are available, which makes a detailed abundance analysis both more interesting and more precise than for isolated stars. We have reconstructed the spectra of the individual components of V453 Cyg from the observed composite spectra using the technique of spectral disentangling. From these disentangled spectra we have obtained improved effective temperature measurements of 27900 +/- 400 K and 26200 +/- 500 K, for the primary and secondary stars respectively, by fitting non-LTE theoretical line profiles to the hydrogen Balmer lines. Armed with these high-precision effective temperatures and the accurately known surface gravities of the stars we have obtained the abundances of helium and metallic elements. A detailed abundance analysis of the primary star shows a normal (solar) helium abundance if the microturbulence velocity derived from metallic lines is used. The elemental abundances show no indication that CNO-processed material is present in the photosphere of this high-mass terminal age main sequence star. The elemental abundances of the secondary star were derived by differential study against a template spectrum of a star with similar characteristics. Both the primary and secondary components display elemental abundances which are in the ranges observed in the Galactic OB stars.",Astronomy
2010,262.0,"We demonstrate that magnetic reconnection is not necessary to initiate fast CMEs. The Aly-Sturrock conjecture states that the magnetic energy of a given force free boundary field is maximized when the field is open. This is problematic for CME initiation because it leaves little or no magnetic energy to drive the eruption, unless reconnection is present to allow some of the field to escape without opening. Thus, it has been thought that reconnection must be present to initiate CMEs. This theory has not been subject to rigorous numerical testing because conventional MHD numerical models contain numerical diffusion, which introduces uncontrolled numerical reconnection. We use a quasi-Lagrangian simulation technique to run the first controlled experiments of CME initiation in the complete lack of reconnection. We find that a flux rope confined by an arcade, when twisted beyond a critical amount, can escape to an open state, allowing some of the surrounding arcade to shrink and releasing magnetic energy from the global field. This mechanism includes a true ideal MHD instability. We conclude that reconnection is not a necessary trigger for fast CME eruptions.",Astronomy
2011,407.0,"Psychology faces a replication crisis. The Reproducibility Project: Psychology sought to replicate the effects of 100 psychology studies. Though 97% of the original studies produced statistically significant results, only 36% of the replication studies did so (Open Science Collaboration, 2015). This inability to replicate previously published results, however, is not limited to psychology (Ioannidis, 2005). Replication projects in medicine (Prinz et al., 2011) and behavioral economics (Camerer et al., 2016) resulted in replication rates of 25 and 61%, respectively, and analyses in genetics (Munafò, 2009) and neuroscience (Button et al., 2013) question the validity of studies in those fields. Science, in general, is reckoning with challenges in one of its basic tenets: replication. Comparative psychology also faces the grand challenge of producing replicable research. Though social psychology has born the brunt of most of the critique regarding failed replications, comparative psychology suffers from some of the same problems faced by social psychology (e.g., small sample sizes). Yet, comparative psychology follows the methods of cognitive psychology by often using within-subjects designs, which may buffer it from replicability problems (Open Science Collaboration, 2015).

2012,193.0,"Gamma-ray astronomy has produced for several years now sky maps for low photon statistics, non-negligible background and comparatively poor angular resolution. Quantifying the significance of spatial features remains difficult. Besides, spectrum extraction requires regions with large statistics while maps in energy bands allow only qualitative interpretation. The two main competing mechanisms in the VHE domain are the Inverse-Compton emission from accelerated electrons radiating through synchrotron in the X-ray domain and the interactions between accelerated hadrons and the surrounding medium, leading to the production and subsequent decay of Pi0 mesons. The spectrum of the VHE emission from leptons is predicted to steepen with increasing distance from the acceleration zone, owing to synchrotron losses (i.e. cooled population). It would remain approximately constant for hadrons. Ideally, spectro-imaging analysis would have the same spatial scale in the TeV and X-ray domains, to distinguish the local emission mechanisms. More realistically, we investigate here the possibility of improving upon the currently published HESS results by using more sophisticated tools.",Astronomy

Keeping the density fluctuation up to the second order, we obtain the nonlinear field equation of the 2-pt correlation \xi(r), which contains the 3-pt correlation and formal ultra-violet divergences. By the Groth-Peebles hierarchical ansatz and the mass renormalization, the equation becomes closed with two new terms beyond the Gaussian approximation, and their coefficients are taken as parameters. The analytic solution is obtained in terms of the hypergeometric functions, which is checked numerically. With one single set of fixed two parameters, the correlation $\xi(r)$ and the corresponding power spectrum P(k) match simultaneously the results from all the major surveys, such as APM, SDSS, 2dfGRS, and REFLEX. The model gives a unifying understanding of several seemingly unrelated features of large scale structure from a field-theoretical perspective.

In modern theorizing, habits are represented in memory as implicit context–response associations, and they guide responding in conjunction with goals. Habits thus have important implications for our field. Emerging research shows that habits are an important mechanism by which people self-regulate and achieve long-term goals. Also, habits change through specific interventions, such as changes in context cues. I speculate that understanding of habits also holds promise for reducing intergroup discrimination and for understanding lay theories of the causes for action. In short, by recognizing habit, the field gains understanding of a central mechanism by which actions persist in daily life.",Psychology

Although there are overlaps, postcolonial theory and the sociology of race are not reducible to each other. Postcolonial theory emphasizes the global, historical, and therefore colonial dimensions of race relations, including how imperialism has generated racial thought and racial stratification. A postcolonial sociology of race, therefore, would (1) analytically recover empire and colonialism and their legacies, (2) excavate colonial racialization and trace its continuities into the present, (3) reveal the reciprocal constitution of racialized identities that began under empire, and (4) critique the imperial standpoint and seek out the subjugated epistemologies of racialized subjects.

We form opinions on topics such as war and climate change, on other people such as our work colleagues and celebrities, and on behaviours such as sexual activity and waste recycling. At times, these attitudes can be the focus of bitter debate, and as humans we naturally crave to understand attitudes and how to change them. In four sections and 11 chapters, Greg Maio and Geoffrey Haddock describe how scientific methods have been used to better understand attitudes and how they change. The first section looks at what attitudes are and why they are important. The second section examines the ability of attitudes to predict behaviour. From there, the authors consider how attitudes are formed and changed. Finally, they present a variety of major issues for understanding internal (such as, neurological) and external (such as, culture) influences on attitude, along with unresolved questions. With the aid of a few helpful metaphors, the text provides readers with a grasp of the fundamental concepts for understanding attitudes and an appreciation of the scientific challenges that lie ahead. The Psychology of Attitudes and Attitude Change is for students in psychology, health psychology, communication, business and political science. It is a core text for courses in the psychology of attitudes, persuasion, and social influence and a key resource for modules in social cognition and introductory social psychology.",Psychology
2019,42.0,"Collapsars are fast-spinning, massive stars, whose core collapse liberates an energy, that can be channeled in the form of ultrarelativistic jets. These jets transport the energy from the collapsed core to large distances, where it is dissipated in the form of long-duration gamma-ray bursts. In this paper we study the dynamics of ultrarelativistic jets produced in collapsars. Also we extrapolate our results to infer the angular energy distribution of the produced outflows in the afterglow phase. Our main focus is to look for global energetical properties which can be imprinted by the different structure of different progenitor stars. Thus, we employ a number of pre-supernova, stellar models (with distinct masses and metallicities), and inject in all of them jets with fixed initial conditions. We assume that at the injection nozzle, the jet is mildly relativistic (Lorentz factor $\sim 5$), has a finite half-opening angle ($5^\circ$), and carries a power of $10^{51} $erg s$^{-1}$. These jets arrive intact to the stellar surface and break out of it. A large Lorentz factor region $\Gamma\simmore 100$ develops well before the jet reaches the surface of the star, in the unshocked part of the beam, located between the injection nozzle and the first recollimation shock. These high values of $\Gamma$ are possible because the finite opening angle of the jet allows for free expansion towards the radial direction. We find a strong correlation between the angular energy distribution of the jet, after its eruption from the progenitor surface, and the mass of the progenitors. The angular energy distribution of the jets from light progenitor models is steeper than that of the jets injected in more massive progenitor stars. This trend is also imprinted in the angular distribution of isotropic equivalent energy.",Astronomy

2021,587.0,"Cultural evolutionary theory is an interdisciplinary field in which human culture is viewed as a Darwinian process of variation, competition, and inheritance, and the tools, methods, and theories developed by evolutionary biologists to study genetic evolution are adapted to study cultural change. It is argued here that an integration of the theories and findings of mainstream social psychology and of cultural evolutionary theory can be mutually beneficial. Social psychology provides cultural evolution with a set of empirically verified microevolutionary cultural processes, such as conformity, model-based biases, and content biases, that are responsible for specific patterns of cultural change. Cultural evolutionary theory provides social psychology with ultimate explanations for, and an understanding of the population-level consequences of, many social psychological phenomena, such as social learning, conformity, social comparison, and intergroup processes, as well as linking social psychology with other social science disciplines such as cultural anthropology, archaeology, and sociology.",Psychology
2022,758.0,"This paper is about tendencies to the subversion of sociology as a discipline. It connects external factors of the wider socio-political environment of higher education in the UK, especially those associated with the audit culture and new systems of governance, with the internal organization of the discipline. While the environment is similar for all social science subjects, the paper argues that there are specific consequences for sociology because of characteristics peculiar to the discipline. The paper discusses these consequences in terms of the changing relationship between sociology and the growing interdisciplinary area of applied social studies as a form of 'mode 2 knowledge'. It argues that while sociology 'exports' concepts, methodologies and personnel it lacks the internal disciplinary integrity of other 'exporter' disciplines, such as economics, political science and anthropology. The consequence is an increasingly blurred distinction between sociology as a discipline and the interdisciplinary area of applied social studies with a potential loss of disciplinary identity. The paper concludes with a discussion of how this loss of identity is associated with a reduced ability to reproduce a critical sensibility within sociology and absorption to the constraints of audit culture with its preferred form of mode 2 knowledge.",Sociology

Although MLM analyses are likely to increase in frequency in counseling psychology research, many readers of counseling psychology journals have had only limited exposure to MLM concepts. This paper provides an overview of MLM that blends mathematical concepts with examples drawn from counseling psychology. This tutorial is intended to be a first step in learning about MLM; readers are referred to other sources for more advanced explorations of MLM. In addition to being a tutorial for understanding and perhaps even conducting MLM analyses, this paper reviews recent research in counseling psychology that has adopted a multilevel framework, and it provides ideas for MLM approaches to future research in counseling psychology.",Psychology

Thirteen of the targets are members of the Classical population: six dynamically hot Classicals, five dynamically cold Classicals, and two dynamically cold inner Classical Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs). We fit our observations using thermal models to determine the sizes and albedos of our targets finding that the cold Classical TNOs have distinctly higher visual albedos than the hot Classicals and other TNO dynamical classes. The cold Classicals are known to be distinct from other TNOs in terms of their color distribution, size distribution, and binarity fraction. The Classical objects in our sample all have red colors yet they show a diversity of albedos which suggests that there is not a simple relationship between albedo and color. As a consequence of high albedos, the mass estimate of the cold Classical Kuiper Belt is reduced from approximately 0.01 Earth masses to approximately 0.001 Earth masses. Our results also increase significantly the sample of small Classical KBOs with known albedos and sizes from 21 to 32 such objects.",Astronomy
2025,360.0,"Research on curiosity has undergone 2 waves of intense activity. The 1st, in the 1960s, focused mainly on curiosity's psychological underpinnings. The 2nd, in the 1970s and 1980s, was characterized by attempts to measure curiosity and assess its dimensionality. This article reviews these contributions with a concentration on the 1st wave. It is argued that theoretical accounts of curiosity proposed during the 1st period fell short in 2 areas: They did not offer an adequate explanation for why people voluntarily seek out curiosity, and they failed to delineate situational determinants of curiosity. Furthermore, these accounts did not draw attention to, and thus did not explain, certain salient characteristics of curiosity: its intensity, transience, association with impulsivity, and tendency to disappoint when satisfied. A new account of curiosity is offered that attempts to address these shortcomings. The new account interprets curiosity as a form of cognitively induced deprivation that arises from the perception of a gap in knowledge or understanding. Curiosity is the most superficial of all the affections; it changes its object perpetually; it has an appetite which is very sharp, but very easily satisfied; and it has always an appearance of giddiness, rest",Psychology

2027,284.0,"Understanding the origin and evolution of dwarf early-type galaxies remains an important open issue in modern astrophysics. Internal kinematics of a galaxy contains signatures of violent phenomena which may have occurred, e.g. mergers or tidal interactions, while stellar population keeps a fossil record of the star formation history, therefore studying connection between them becomes crucial for understanding galaxy evolution. Here, in the first paper of the series, we present the data on spatially resolved stellar populations and internal kinematics for a large sample of dwarf elliptical (dE) and lenticular (dS0) galaxies in the Virgo cluster. We obtained radial velocities, velocity dispersions, stellar ages and metallicities out to 1--2 half-light radii by re-analysing already published long-slit and integral-field spectroscopic datasets using the {\sc NBursts} full spectral fitting technique. Surprisingly, bright representatives of the dE/dS0 class ($M_B = -18.0 ... -16.0$ mag) look very similar to intermediate-mass and giant lenticulars and ellipticals: (1) their nuclear regions often harbour young metal-rich stellar populations always associated with the drops in the velocity dispersion profiles; (2) metallicity gradients in the main discs/spheroids vary significantly from nearly flat profiles to -0.9 dex $r_e^{-1}$, i.e. somewhat 3 times steeper than for typical bulges; (3) kinematically decoupled cores were discovered in 4 galaxies, including two with very little, if any, large scale rotation. These results suggest similarities in the evolutionary paths of dwarf and giant early-type galaxies and call for reconsidering the role of major mergers in the dE/dS0 evolution.",Astronomy
2028,677.0,"Sociologists of health and illness have tended to overlook the architecture and buildings used in health care. This contrasts with medical geographers who have yielded a body of work on the significance of places and spaces in the experience of health and illness. A review of sociological studies of the role of the built environment in the performance of medical practice uncovers an important vein of work, worthy of further study. Through the historically situated example of hospital architecture, this article seeks to tease out substantive and methodological issues that can inform a distinctive sociology of healthcare architecture. Contemporary healthcare buildings manifest design models developed for hotels, shopping malls and homes. These design features are congruent with neoliberal forms of subjectivity in which patients are constituted as consumers and responsibilised citizens. We conclude that an adequate sociology of healthcare architecture necessitates an appreciation of both the construction and experience of buildings, exploring the briefs and plans of their designers, and observing their everyday uses. Combining approaches and methods from the sociology of health and illness and science and technology studies offers potential for a novel research agenda that takes healthcare buildings as its substantive focus.",Sociology

2031,749.0,"ABS'I'RAC'I' Mannheim's 1923 essay 'The Problem of Generations' has often been described as the seminal theoretical treatment of generations as a sociological phenomenon. Yet in practice scant attention has been paid to the sociology of generations by British sociologists. This is despite the notion of generation being widespread in everyday language as a way of understanding differences between age groups and as a means of locating individuals and groups within historical time. This paper aims to raise the profile of the sociology of generations within British sociology. It is shown that Mannheim's essay can be read as a text which contributes to our understanding of key sociological issues, in addition to 'the problem of generations'. These issues include the nature of time, the relationship between biology and the social, and socio-psychological connections of language and knowledge. The notion of generation is widely used in the everyday world to make sense of differences between age groupings in society and to locate individual selves and other persons within historical time. We speak, for example, of 'my generation' and of 'the older generation'. We describe those who grew up in, say, the 1960s, as belonging to 'the sixties generation'. We speak of 'a few generations ago', 'a new generation' and of 'the generation gap'. Despite the notion of generation being in such common currency, contemporary sociologists have paid scant attention to the significance of generation. Yet, a longstanding tradition of theorizing the nature and significance of biological age groupings for processes of social change and continuity can be traced back to the ancient Greek philosophers (Nash 1978). More recent contributions have come from Ortega y Gasset, with his notion of vigencias (Spitzer 1973) and from the French Annales school, via the concept of mentalities collectives (Esler 1984). However, it is Mannheim's (1952 [1923]) 'The Problem of Generations' which is",Sociology
2032,90.0,"We use extensive new observations of the very rich z ~ 0.4 cluster of galaxies A851 to examine the nature and origin of starburst galaxies in intermediate-redshift clusters. New HST observations, Spitzer photometry and ground-based spectroscopy cover most of a region of the cluster about 10 arcmin across, corresponding to a clustercentric radial distance of about 1.6 Mpc. This spatial coverage allows us to confirm the existence of a morphology-density relation within this cluster, and to identify several large, presumably infalling, subsystems. We confirm our previous conclusion that a very large fraction of the starforming galaxies in A851 have recently undergone starbursts. We argue that starbursts are mostly confined to two kinds of sites: infalling groups and the cluster center. At the cluster center it appears that infalling galaxies are undergoing major mergers, resulting in starbursts whose optical emission lines are completely buried beneath dust. The aftermath of this process appears to be proto-S0 galaxies devoid of star formation. In contrast, major mergers do not appear to be the cause of most of the starbursts in infalling groups, and fewer of these events result in the transformation of the galaxy into an S0. Some recent theoretical work provides possible explanations for these two distinct processes, but it is not clear whether they can operate with the very high efficiency needed to account for the very large starburst rate observed.",Astronomy

Emergence of preferences early in development and cross-cultural agreement on attractiveness challenge a long-held view that our preferences reflect arbitrary standards of beauty set by cultures. Averageness, symmetry, and sexual dimorphism are good candidates for biologically based standards of beauty. A critical review and meta-analyses indicate that all three are attractive in both male and female faces and across cultures. Theorists have proposed that face preferences may be adaptations for mate choice because attractive traits signal important aspects of mate quality, such as health.

Overcoming this problem requires an expansion of the premises of social theory to incorporate those general features of social reality which generate the phenomenon of ‘the international’. This expansion can be achieved using Leon Trotsky's idea of ‘uneven and combined development’. Specifically, the existence of ‘the international’ arises ultimately from the ‘unevenness’ of human sociohistorical existence; its distinctive characteristics can be derived from analysis of the resultant condition of ‘combined development’; and its significance, thus sociologically redefined, entails a reconceptualization of ‘development’ itself — one which removes the source of the ‘domestic analogy’ problem for historical sociology.",Sociology

2039,719.0,"The article argues for a new agenda in qualitative research and sociology of knowledge. It starts with the assumption that meaning-making activities which lie at the heart of sociology’s interpretative paradigm today are widely embedded in expert proceedings and organized or institutionalized work on symbolic ordering. This holds true for the sciences or other specialized discourse realms (like religion), but it also counts for public discourses/public arenas. While interpretative traditions in sociology have addressed issues of discourse research, they did not succeed in establishing a proper sociological approach to discourse. Therefore, the article proposes a sociology of knowledge approach to discourse (SKAD), located in the social constructivist tradition of Peter L. Berger and Thomas Luckmann. Such an approach is able to account for discourses as processes of symbolic ordering and to take up questions of discourse research raised by French philosopher Michel Foucault. Foucault indeed insisted on discourses as “truth games” and activities which set up knowledge claims. But, this interest in politics of knowledge has not so far been taken up in today’s arenas of discourse research. Therefore, SKAD proposes concepts and procedures for a new agenda of sociology of knowledge, deeply committed to qualitative and interpretative research traditions in sociology.",Sociology

Recent work in the sociology of knowledge demonstrates a direct linkage between social interaction patterns and the structure of ideas, suggesting that scientific collaboration networks affect scientific practice. I test three competing models for sociological collaboration networks and find that a structurally cohesive core that has been growing steadily since the early 1960s characterizes the discipline's coauthorship network. The results show that participation in the sociology collaboration network depends on research specialty and that quantitative work is more likely to be coauthored than non-quantitative work. However, structural embeddedness within the network core given collaboration is largely unrelated to specialty area. This pattern is consistent with a loosely overlapping specialty structure that has potentially integrative implications for theoretical development in sociology.",Sociology

2042,161.0,"If the accelerated expansion of the Universe at the present epoch is driven by a dark energy scalar field, there may well be a non-trivial coupling between the dark energy and the cold dark matter (CDM) fluid. Such interactions give rise to new features in cosmological structure growth, like an additional long-range attractive force between CDM particles, or variations of the dark matter particle mass with time. We have implemented these effects in the N-body code GADGET-2 and present results of a series of high-resolution N-body simulations where the dark energy component is directly interacting with the cold dark matter. As a consequence of the new physics, CDM and baryon distributions evolve differently both in the linear and in the nonlinear regime of structure formation. Already on large scales a linear bias develops between these two components, which is further enhanced by the nonlinear evolution. We also find, in contrast with previous work, that the density profiles of CDM halos are less concentrated in coupled dark energy cosmologies compared with LCDM, and that this feature does not depend on the initial conditions setup, but is a specific consequence of the extra physics induced by the coupling. Also, the baryon fraction in halos in the coupled models is significantly reduced below the universal baryon fraction. These features alleviate tensions between observations and the LCDM model on small scales. Our methodology is ideally suited to explore the predictions of coupled dark energy models in the fully non-linear regime, which can provide powerful constraints for the viable parameter space of such scenarios.",Astronomy

2044,207.0,"A survey for the molecular clouds in the Galaxy with NANTEN mm telescope has discovered molecular loops in the Galactic center region. The loops show monotonic gradients of the line of sight velocity along the loops and the large velocity dispersions towards their foot points. It is suggested that these loops are explained in terms of the buoyant rise of magnetic loops due to the Parker instability. We have carried out global three-dimensional magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of the gas disk in the Galactic center. The gravitational potential is approximated by the axisymmetric potential proposed by Miyamoto &amp; Nagai (1975). At the initial state, we assume a warm (~ 10^4 K) gas torus threaded by azimuthal magnetic fields. Self-gravity and radiative cooling of the gas are ignored. We found that buoyantly rising magnetic loops are formed above the differentially rotating, magnetically turbulent disk. By analyzing the results of global MHD simulations, we have identified individual loops, about 180 in the upper half of the disk, and studied their statistical properties such as their length, width, height, and velocity distributions along the loops. Typical length and height of a loop are 1kpc and 200pc, respectively. The line of sight velocity changes linearly along a loop and shows large dispersions around the foot-points. Numerical results indicate that loops emerge preferentially from the region where magnetic pressure is large.

Accordingly, if we map out the division of sociological labor, we discover antagonistic interdependence among four types of knowledge: professional, critical, policy, and public. In the best of all worlds the flourishing of each type of sociology is a condition for the flourishing of all, but they can just as easily assume pathological forms or become victims of exclusion and subordination. This field of power beckons us to explore the relations among the four types of sociology as they vary historically and nationally, and as they provide the template for divergent individual careers.

2056,115.0,"The dynamics of infinite, asymptotically uniform, distributions of self-gravitating particles in one spatial dimension provides a simple toy model for the analogous three dimensional problem. We focus here on a limitation of such models as treated so far in the literature: the force, as it has been specified, is well defined in infinite point distributions only if there is a centre of symmetry (i.e. the definition requires explicitly the breaking of statistical translational invariance). The problem arises because naive background subtraction (due to expansion, or by ""Jeans' swindle"" for the static case), applied as in three dimensions, leaves an unregulated contribution to the force due to surface mass fluctuations. Following a discussion by Kiessling, we show that the problem may be resolved by defining the force in infinite point distributions as the limit of an exponentially screened pair interaction. We show that this prescription gives a well defined (finite) force acting on particles in a class of perturbed infinite lattices, which are the point processes relevant to cosmological N-body simulations. For identical particles the dynamics of the simplest toy model is equivalent to that of an infinite set of points with inverted harmonic oscillator potentials which bounce elastically when they collide. We discuss previous results in the literature, and present new results for the specific case of this simplest (static) model starting from ""shuffled lattice"" initial conditions. These show qualitative properties (notably its ""self-similarity"") of the evolution very similar to those in the analogous simulations in three dimensions, which in turn resemble those in the expanding universe.",Astronomy

We find that some correlations in the classical group, as well as the (dynamically) cold and hot subgroups depend on the size of the objects. As a by-product of our study, we were able to identify new candidates for light curve studies and found that ~55% of the objects showed variability above 0.15 mags. This is a higher value than what is found in other studies. Since our sample contains smaller objects than samples from other studies, this result might be an indication that the smaller TNOs are more elongated than the larger ones.",Astronomy

2063,208.0,"It has been well established that the $f$-mode of relativistic ordinary-fluid neutron stars displays a universal scaling behavior. Here we study whether the ""ordinary"" $f_{\rm o}$- and ""superfluid"" $f_{\rm s}$-modes of superfluid neutron stars also show similar universal behavior. We first consider a simple case where the neutron superfluid and normal fluid are decoupled, and with each fluid modeled by a polytropic equation of state. We find that the $f_{\rm o}$-mode obeys the same scaling laws as established for the $f$-mode of orindary-fluid stars. However, the oscillation frequency of the $f_{\rm s}$-mode obeys a different scaling law, which can be derived analytically from a homogenous two-fluid stellar model in Newtonian gravity. Next the coupling effect between the two fluids is studied via a parameterized model of entrainment. We find that the coupling in general breaks the universal behavior seen in the case of decoupled fluids. Based on a relativistic variational principle, an approximated expression is derived for the first-order shift of the $f_{\rm s}$-mode squared frequency due to the entrainment.",Astronomy
2064,140.0,"After considering the effects of negative feedback on the process of star formation, we explore the relationship between star formation process and the associated feedback, by investigating how the mechanical feedback from supernovae(SNe) and radiative feedback from luminous objects regulate the star formation rate and therefore affect the cosmic reionization.Based on our present knowledge of the negative feedback theory and some numerical simulations, we construct an analytic model in the framework of the Lambda cold dark matter model. In certain parameter regions, our model can explain some observational results properly. In large halos(T_vir&gt;10000 K), both mechanical and radiative feedback have a similar behavior: the relative strength of negative feedback reduces as the redshift decreases. In contrast, in small halos (T_vir&lt;10000 K$) that are thought to breed the first stars at early time, the radiative feedback gets stronger when the redshift decreases. And the star formation rate in these small halos depends very weakly on the star-formation efficiency. Our results show that the radiative feedback is important for the early generation stars. It can suppress the star formation rate considerably. But the mechanical feedback from the SNe explosions is not able to affect the early star formation significantly. The early star formation in small-halo objects is likely to be self-regulated. The radiative and mechanical feedback dominates the star formation rate of the PopII/I stars all along. The feedback from first generation stars is very strong and should not be neglected. However, their effects on the cosmic reionization are not significant, which results in a small contribution to the optical depth of Thomson scattering.",Astronomy

The data cover 0.68 deg^2 of the X-ray Multi-Mirror (XMM) Large-Scale Structure (LSS) survey area where overlapping multi-wavelength imaging data permits an investigation of the physical nature of selected sources. METHODS: The KX method identifies quasars on the basis of their optical (R and z') to near-infrared (Ks) photometry and point-like morphology. We combine these data with optical (u*,g'r',i',z') and mid-infrared (3.6-24 micron) wavebands to reconstruct the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of candidate quasars. RESULTS: Of 93 sources selected as candidate quasars by the KX method, 25 are classified as quasars by the subsequent SED analysis. Spectroscopic observations are available for 12/25 of these sources and confirm the quasar hypothesis in each case. Even more, 90% of the SED-classified quasars show X-ray emission, a property not shared by any of the false candidates in the KX-selected sample. Applying a photometric redshift analysis to the sources without spectroscopy indicates that the 25 sources classified as quasars occupy the interval 0.7 &lt; z &lt; 2.5.

First, it addresses the question of terminology, arguing that the naming process is a glimpse into the complexities of power and history that characterize the field. Second, focusing on the last 15 years of scholarship, it considers how sociological research on users and practitioners of TM/CAM has developed in that time. Third, it addresses two newer strands of work termed here the ‘big picture’ and the ‘big question’. The big picture includes concepts that offer interpretation of what is happening at a societal level to constrain and enable observed patterns of social practice (pluralism, integration, hybridity and activism). The big question, ‘Does it work?’, is one of epistemology and focuses on two developing fields of critical enquiry – first, social critiques of medical science knowledge production and, second, attempts to explain the nature of interventions, i.e. how they work.

For non helical turbulence the time evolution of the cross-shear components of the mean field do not depend on any other components excepting themselves.

The latter is frequently understood as sociology's special object with sociology itself a distinctively modern form of explanation. The period of sociology's disciplinary formation was also the heyday of European colonialism, yet the colonial relationship did not figure in the development of sociological understandings. While the recent emergence of postcolonialism appears to have initiated a reconsideration of understandings of modernity, with the development of theories of multiple modernities, I suggest that this engagement is more an attempt at recuperating the transformative aspect of postcolonialism than engaging with its critiques. In setting out the challenge of postcolonialism to dominant sociological accounts, I also address `missing feminist/queer revolutions', suggesting that by engaging with postcolonialism there is the potential to transform sociological understandings by opening up a dialogue beyond the simple pluralism of identity claims.",Sociology

On the other hand, he may believe that the available therapy is marginally effective, expensive, and debilitating. The pilot seeing the landing lights only when they are a few yards away may decide that his plane is adequately aligned with the runway if he is alone and familiar with that plight. He may be more inclined to circle the field before another try at landing if he has many passengers and recent memory of another plane crashing under those circumstances.

But he may be less clearly biased if a recent false alarm has cost a canning company millions of dollars and left some damaged reputations. The making of almost any fine discrimination is beset with such considerations of probability and utility, which are extraneous and potentially confounding when one is attempting to measure the acuity of discrimination per se. The ROC is an analytical technique, with origins in statistical decision theory and electronic detection theory, that quite effectively isolates the effects of the observer's response bias, or decision criterion, in the study of discrimination behavior. This capability, pursued through a century of psychological testing, provides a relatively pure measure of the discriminability of different stimuli and of the capacity of organisms to discriminate. The ROC also treats quantitatively the response, or decision, aspects of choice behavior. The decision parameter can then be functionally related to the probabilities of the stimulus alternatives and to the utilities of the various stimulus-response pairs, or to the observer's expectations and motivations. In separating and quantifying discrimination and decision processes, the ROC promises a more reliable and valid solution to some practical problems and enhances our understanding of the perceptual and cognitive phenomena that depend directly on these fundamental processes. In several problem areas in psychology, effects that were supposed to reflect properties of the discrimination process have been shown by the ROC analysis to reflect instead properties of the decision process.",Psychology

A comparison of sociology with anthropology, history, and literature–disciplines which have been more deeply transformed–suggests factors that may facilitate or inhibit feminist paradigm shifts. The traditional subject matter of sociology fell into a co-optable middle ground, neither as thoroughly male centered as in history or literature, nor as deeply gendered as in anthropology. In addition, feminist perspectives have been contained in sociology by functionalist conceptualizations of gender, by the inclusion of gender as a variable rather than as a theoretical category, and by being ghettoized, especially in Marxist sociology. Feminist rethinking is also affected by underlying epistemologies (proceeding more rapidly in fields based on interpretive rather than positivist understanding), and by the status and nature of theory within a discipline.",Sociology

On the theoretical side, a model of practice rooted in modern cognitive psychology, the chunking theory of learning, is formulated. The paper consists of (1) the presentation of a set of empirical practice curves; (2) mathematical investigations into the nature of power law functions; (3) evaluations of the ability of three different classes of functions to adequately model the empirical curves; (4) a discussion of the existing models of practice; (5) a presentation of the chunking theory of learning",Psychology

These mechanisms have special theoretical importance because disparities in health behaviors, unlike disparities in many other components of health, involve something more than the ability to use income to purchase good health. Based on a review of broad literatures in sociology, economics, and public health, we classify explanations of higher smoking, lower exercise, poorer diet, and excess weight among low-SES persons into nine broad groups that specify related but conceptually distinct mechanisms. The lack of clear support for any one explanation suggests that the literature on SES disparities in health and health behaviors can do more to design studies that better test for the importance of the varied mechanisms.",Sociology

2079,6.0,"We investigate the effects of neutrino heating and alpha-particle recombination on the hydrodynamics of core-collapse supernovae. Our focus is on the non-linear dynamics of the shock wave that forms in the collapse, and the assembly of positive energy material below it. To this end, we perform time-dependent hydrodynamic simulations with FLASH2.5 in spherical and axial symmetry. These generalize our previous calculations by allowing for bulk neutrino heating and for nuclear statistical equilibrium between n, p and alpha. The heating rate is freely tunable, as is the starting radius of the shock relative to the recombination radius of alpha-particles. An explosion in spherical symmetry involves the excitation of an overstable mode, which may be viewed as the L=0 version of the `Standing Accretion Shock Instability'. In 2D simulations, non-spherical deformations of the shock are driven by plumes of material with positive Bernoulli parameter, which are concentrated well outside the zone of strong neutrino heating. The non-spherical modes of the shock reach a large amplitude only when the heating rate is also high enough to excite convection below the shock. The critical heating rate that causes an explosion depends sensitively on the initial position of the shock relative to the recombination radius. Weaker heating is required to drive an explosion in 2D than in 1D, but the difference also depends on the size of the shock. Forcing the infalling heavy nuclei to break up into n and p below the shock only causes a slight increase in the critical heating rate, except when the shock starts out at a large radius. This shows that heating by neutrinos (or some other mechanism) must play a significant role in pushing the shock far enough out that recombination heating takes over.",Astronomy

Frame co-addition is based on using the detector's Point Response Function (PRF) as an interpolation kernel. This kernel reduces the impact of prior-masked pixels; enables the creation of an optimal matched filtered product for point source detection; and most important, it allows for resolution enhancement (HiRes) to yield a model of the sky that is consistent with the observations to within measurement error. The HiRes functionality allows for non-isoplanatic PRFs, prior noise-variance weighting, uncertainty estimation, and includes a ringing-suppression algorithm.

The presented maps include a co-addition of submm data mined from the SCUBA Data Archive. The co-added data produce the deepest submm continuum maps yet of M82, in which low-level 850 micron continuum has been detected out to 1.5kpc, at least 10% farther in radius than any previously published submm detections of this galaxy. The overall submm morphology and spatial spectral energy distribution of M82 have a general north-south asymmetry consistent with H-alpha and X-ray winds, supporting the association of the extended continuum with outflows of dust grains from the disk into the halo. The new data raise interesting points about the origin and structure of the submm emission in the inner disk of M82. In particular, SCUBA short wavelength evidence of submm continuum peaks that are asymmetrically distributed along the galactic disk suggests the inner-disk emission is re-radiation from dust concentrations along a bar (or perhaps a spiral) rather than edges of a dust torus, as is commonly assumed. Higher resolution submm interferometery data from the Smithsonian Submillimeter Array and later Atacama Large Millimeter Array should spatially resolve and further constrain the reported dust emission structures in M82.",Astronomy

The emission in lines (H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, [OIII], etc.) coincides with a composite nuclear region: an AGN plus a circum-nuclear star-forming ring observed in the HST UV/optical images.

We found that width ($\sim$ 750 km/s) of the Fe II lines correspond to the intermediate component, that may indicate a non-BLR origin of the Fe II lines, or that a large fraction of the Fe II emission arise in the outher parts of the BLR. The weak broad component detected in the H$\alpha$, H$\beta$ and He$\lambda$4686 may come from the unresolved central BLR, but also partly produced by violent starburst in the circum-nuclear ring.

2085,46.0,"We present a systematic temporal and spectral study of all Swift-XRT observations of GRB afterglows discovered between 2005 January and 2007 December. After constructing and fitting all light curves and spectra to power-law models, we classify the components of each afterglow in terms of the canonical X-ray afterglow and test them against the closure relations of the forward shock models for a variety of parameter combinations. The closure relations are used to identify potential jet breaks with characteristics including the uniform jet model with and without lateral spreading and energy injection, and a power-law structured jet model, all with a range of parameters. With this technique, we survey the X-ray afterglows with strong evidence for jet breaks (~12% of our sample), and reveal cases of potential jet breaks that do not appear plainly from the light curve alone (another ~30%), leading to insight into the missing jet break problem. Those X-ray light curves that do not show breaks or have breaks that are not consistent with one of the jet models are explored to place limits on the times of unseen jet breaks. The distribution of jet break times ranges from a few hours to a few weeks with a median of ~1 day, similar to what was found pre-Swift. On average Swift GRBs have lower isotropic equivalent gamma-ray energies, which in turn results in lower collimation corrected gamma-ray energies than those of pre-Swift GRBs.

The analysis of the HI data shows a region of low emissivity that has an excellent morphological correlation with the radio continuum emission. The HII region is partially bordered by a photodissociation region, which, in turn, is encircled by a molecular structure. Taking into account the presence of noncircular motions in the Perseus spiral arm, together with previous distance estimates for the region, we adopt a distance of 2.5 +- 0.5 kpc for Sh2-173. Seven hot stars were identified in the field of Sh2-173, being only one an O-type star. The amount of energetic photons emitted by this star is enough to keep the region ionized and heat the dust. Given that an expanding HII region may trigger star formation, a search for YSO candidates was made using different infrared point source catalogues. A population of 46 YSO candidates was identified projected onto the molecular clouds. On the other hand, Sh2-173 is located in a dense edge of a large HI shell. The possibility for Sh2-173 of being part of a hierarchical system of three generations is suggested. The ages of both, the HII region and the large shell, were estimated and compared. We concluded that Sh2-173 is a young HII region of about 0.6 - 1.0 Myr old. As for the large shell we obtained a dynamical age of 5 +- 1 Myr. These age estimates, together with the relative location of the different structures, support the hypothesis that Sh2-173 is part of a hierarchical system.",Astronomy

We use the cross-correlation technique of Croke &amp; Gabuzda (2008) on the optically thin jet emission to align our VLBA images. Our results are consistent with those obtained from the phase-referencing method, as well as alignment by model-fitted optically thin jet components. Physical parameters of the compact jet regions, such as the magnetic field strength (B_core) and the distance of the radio core to the jet origin (r_core), can be calculated from these measurements. For the source Mrk 501, we find a magnetic field strength of 0.15\pm0.04 G in the 8.4-GHz core at a distance of 0.8\pm0.2 pc from the base of the jet. By extrapolating our 4.6 to 15.4 GHz results for BL Lac (2200+420), we estimate magnetic field strengths of the order of 1 G in the millimetre VLBI core. Using our core-shift measurement between 1.6 and 4.8 GHz for 1803+784, we find B_core(4.8 GHz) = 0.11\pm0.02 G and r_core(4.8 GHz) = 20\pm5 pc.

2093,570.0,"Background/Context This study investigates how people are prepared for professional practice in the clergy, teaching, and clinical psychology. The work is located within research on professional education, and research on the teaching and learning of practice. Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study The purpose of the study is to develop a framework to describe and analyze the teaching of practice in professional education programs, specifically preparation for relational practices. Setting The research took place in eight professional education programs located in seminaries, schools of professional psychology, and universities across the country. Population/Participants/Subjects Our research participants include faculty members, students, and administrators at each of these eight programs. Research Design This research is a comparative case study of professional education across three different professions—the clergy, clinical psychology, and teaching. Our data include qualitative case studies of eight preparation programs: two teacher education programs, three seminaries, and three clinical psychology programs. Data Collection and Analysis For each institution, we conducted site visits that included interviews with administrators, faculty, and staff; observations of multiple classes and field-work; and focus groups with students who were either at the midpoint or at the end of their programs. Conclusions/Recommendations We have identified three key concepts for understanding the pedagogies of practice in professional education: representations, decomposition, and approximations of practice. Representations of practice comprise the different ways that practice is represented in professional education and what these various representations make visible to novices. Decomposition of practice involves breaking down practice into its constituent parts for the purposes of teaching and learning. Approximations of practice refer to opportunities to engage in practices that are more or less proximal to the practices of a profession. In this article, we define and provide examples of the representation, decomposition, and approximation of practice from our study of professional education in the clergy, clinical psychology, and teaching. We conclude that, in the program we studied, prospective teachers have fewer opportunities to engage in approximations that focus on contingent, interactive practice than do novices in the other two professions we studied.",Psychology

2095,478.0,"Much of psychology focuses on universal principles of thought and action. Although an extremely productive pursuit, this approach, by describing only the ""average person,"" risks describing no one in particular. This article discusses an alternate approach that complements interests in universal principles with analyses of the unique psychological meaning that individuals find in their experiences and interactions. Rooted in research on social cognition, this approach examines how people's lay theories about the stability or malleability of human attributes alter the meaning they give to basic psychological processes such as self-regulation and social perception. Following a review of research on this lay theories perspective in the field of social psychology, the implications of analyzing psychological meaning for other fields such as developmental, cultural, and personality psychology are discussed.",Psychology
2096,508.0,"Research in cultural psychology suggests that person is a social and collective construction made possible through an individual's participation in the practices and meanings of a given cultural context. This perspective can make a contribution to some contemporary controversies in personality. In the current article, it is argued that although most conceptions of personality in academic psychology are rooted in a model of the person as independent, in many Asian cultures, personality is constructed on the basis of an alternative model of the person as interdependent. In these cultures, then, personality is experienced and understood as behavior that is characteristic of the person in relationship with others in particular social contexts. Some initial evidence is reviewed and questions for future research are suggested.",Psychology
2097,769.0,"The conditions associated with the existence and stability of democratic society have been a leading concern of political philosophy. In this paper the problem is attacked from a sociological and behavioral standpoint, by presenting a number of hypotheses concerning some social requisites for democracy, and by discussing some of the data available to test these hypotheses. In its concern with conditions—values, social institutions, historical events—external to the political system itself which sustain different general types of political systems, the paper moves outside the generally recognized province of political sociology. This growing field has dealt largely with the internal analysis of organizations with political goals, or with the determinants of action within various political institutions, such as parties, government agencies, or the electoral process. It has in the main left to the political philosopher the larger concern with the relations of the total political system to society as a whole.",Sociology

Thanks to the large effective area of the WAM, we can investigate the time evolution of the spectral peak energy, Et_peak and the luminosity Lt_iso with 1-sec time resolution, and we find that luminosity Lt_iso with 1-sec time resolution, and we find that the time-resolved pulses also satisfy the Epeak-Liso relation, which was found for the time-averaged spectra of other bursts, suggesting the same physical conditions in each pulse. Furthermore, the initial rising phase of each pulse could be an outlier of this relation with higher Et_peak value by about factor 2. This difference could suggest that the fireball radius expands by a factor of 2-4 and/or bulk Lorentz factor of the fireball is decelerated by a factor of 4 during the initial phase, providing a new probe of the fireball dynamics in real time.",Astronomy
2099,483.0,"Evolutionary psychology has emerged over the past 15 years as a major theoretical perspective, generating an increasing volume of empirical studies and assuming a larger presence within psychological science. At the same time, it has generated critiques and remains controversial among some psychologists. Some of the controversy stems from hypotheses that go against traditional psychological theories; some from empirical findings that may have disturbing implications; some from misunderstandings about the logic of evolutionary psychology; and some from reasonable scientific concerns about its underlying framework. This article identifies some of the most common concerns and attempts to elucidate evolutionary psychology's stance pertaining to them. These include issues of testability and falsifiability; the domain specificity versus domain generality of psychological mechanisms; the role of novel environments as they interact with evolved psychological circuits; the role of genes in the conceptual structure of evolutionary psychology; the roles of learning, socialization, and culture in evolutionary psychology; and the practical value of applied evolutionary psychology. The article concludes with a discussion of the limitations of current evolutionary psychology.",Psychology

2103,423.0,"Positive psychology has figured itself as no less than a revolutionary reorientation of psychology, one that makes individual `flourishing' the primary object of study and intervention. There are clear comparisons to be made between this movement and earlier ones that have embraced both individualism and an ethos of adjustment, such as the popular mind cures of the late 19th century and the influential mental hygiene movement of the early 20th century. We argue for a focus beyond the individual in isolation, a perspective that takes in the totality of the social environment and an ethical stance that values social engagement and activism. We further call for more nuanced conceptions of happiness, virtue, and strengths, as well as for more socially informed theorizing about human flourishing. Finally, we suggest that positive psychology, with its growing assortment of applied uses, serves to address the acute market pressures facing clinical psychologists today.",Psychology
2104,904.0,"Unlike older sciences such as physics and biology, sociology has never had a revolution. Modern sociology is still classical—largely psychological, teleological, and individualistic—and even less scientific than classical sociology. But pure sociology is different: It predicts and explains the behavior of social life with its location and direction in social space—its geometry. Here I illustrate pure sociology with formulations about the behavior of ideas, including a theory of scienticity that predicts and explains the degree to which an idea is likely to be scientific (testable, general, simple, valid, and original). For example: Scienticity is a curvilinear function of social distance from the subject. This formulation explains numerous facts about the history and practice of science, such as why some sciences evolved earlier and faster than others and why so much sociology is so unscientific. Because scientific theory is the most scientific science, the theory of scienticity also implies a theory of theory and a methodology for the development of theory.",Sociology

2107,378.0,"Although personality research has made much progress in developing an individual-difference psychology of creativity, the nature of this phenomenon can only be fully illuminated if a social psychology of creativity is developed as well. Yet experimental studies of social and environmental influences on creativity are extremely rare. A major obstacle to such research is the criterion problem: the lack of a clear operational definition and an appropriate assessment methodology. For a variety of reasons, both the popular creativity tests and the subjective assessment techniques used in some previous creativity studies are ill-suited to social psychological studies of creativity. A consensual definition of creativity is presented and, as a refinement of previous subjective methods, a reliable subjective assessment technique based on that definition is described. Several studies testing the methodology in both artistic and verbal domains are presented, and the advantages and limitations of this technique are discussed. The present methodology can be particularly useful for the development of a social psychology of creativity because of the nature of the tasks employed and the nature of the creativity assessments obtained. In the discussion, creativity assessment is considered as one instance illustrating the more general issue of the divergent aims and methods of personality psychology and social psychology.",Psychology

2109,884.0,"This article proposes that the urgent task for feminist sociology is to recuperate those lost or residual `body matters' which lurk, unattended to, on the sidelines of the social. Feminist sociology must carefully negotiate the complex space between sociality and corporeality. The new feminist philosophies of the body tend sometimes to grate against this project by valorizing the body but de-valorizing gender. The new sociology of the body is recuperating the body within sociology, but pays insufficient attention to the ways in which gendered bodies have always enjoyed varying degrees of absence or presence in the sociological imaginary - in the guise of `female corporeality' and `male embodiment'. By revisiting the classical texts of sociology, such as those of Durkheim, Weber and particularly Simmel, I explore the textual strategies whereby `the body' and `the social' were dissociated in the first place and how, simultaneously, woman is saturated with, while man is divested of, corporeality and she is divested while he is invested with sociality. The absent women in sociology were the women in the body excluded from the social. It is male bodies which animate the social - they appear for a fleeting moment, only to disappear immediately, in the space between `corporeality' and `sociality'. Thus, it is not simply a case of recuperating bodies into the social, but of excavating the gendered subtexts whereby gendered bodies were differently inscribed into and out of the social in the first place. The crucial point here is not the more familiar story of her saturation with corporeality but the less familiar one of what happened to his body - how, that is, did male sociologists effect the disappearance of their own bodies in the textual strategies of sociology?",Sociology

2111,632.0,"The effect of the individual analyst on research findings can create a credibility problem for qualitative approaches from the perspective of evaluative criteria utilized in quantitative psychology. This paper explicates the ways in which objectivity and reliability are understood in qualitative analysis conducted from within three distinct epistemological frameworks: realism, contextual constructionism, and radical constructionism. It is argued that quality criteria utilized in quantitative psychology are appropriate to the evaluation of qualitative analysis only to the extent that it is conducted within a naive or scientific realist framework. The discussion is illustrated with reference to the comparison of two independent grounded theory analyses of identical material. An implication of this illustration is to identify the potential to develop a radical constructionist strand of grounded theory.",Psychology

The social environment includes the groups to which we belong, the neighborhoods in which we live, the organization of our workplaces, and the policies we create to order our lives.

These findings suggest that the social environment influences disease pathways. Yet much remains to be learned about the social environment, including how to understand, define, and measure it.

But this body of knowledge has had little influence on sociology. Sociological research on choice emphasizes how features of the social environment shape individual behavior, not people's underlying decision processes. Our aim in this article is to provide an overview of selected ideas, models, and data sources from decision research that can fuel new lines of inquiry on how socially situated actors navigate both everyday and major life choices. We also highlight opportunities and challenges for cross-fertilization between sociology and decision research that can allow the methods, findings, and contexts of each field to expand their joint range of inquiry.",Sociology

For example, what does it mean if a replication attempt “fails”—does it mean that the original results, or the theory that predicted them, have been falsified? And how should “failed” replications affect our belief in the validity of the original research? In this paper, we consider the replication debate from a historical and philosophical perspective, and provide a conceptual analysis of both replication and falsification as they pertain to this important discussion. Along the way, we highlight the importance of auxiliary assumptions (for both testing theories and attempting replications), and introduce a Bayesian framework for assessing “failed” replications in terms of how they should affect our confidence in original findings.",Psychology
2115,603.0,"Introduction This book is an attempt to define and describe a newly emerging field of study: the developmental psychology of music. It represents the confluence of the disciplines of developmental psychology and music psychology; both of these, of course, constituting parts of the subjects of psychology and music, as well as of education. All these terms are labels of convenience for agreed areas of knowledge. They are to a certain extent arbitrary, and susceptible to change and obsolescence as knowledge advances. It could indeed be argued that this is a good thing, since the imposition of artificial subject boundaries in educational institutions and curricula can often impede the cross-fertilisation of ideas by which any discipline proceeds. I have therefore deliberately cast my net widely: my account will be overinclusive rather than underinclusive. ‘Developmental psychology’ has been virtually synonymous with ‘child development’ for many decades, although the increasing emphasis upon a ‘life-span’ approach (e.g. Ambron and Brodzinsky, 1979) means that behavioural changes in adulthood are now receiving more attention. The research to be described in this book has been carried out on adults, as well as on children and adolescents. ‘Music psychology’ is better thought of as a collection of loosely related topics than as a coherent discipline with any integrated conceptual or empirical framework.",Psychology
2116,242.0,"Here we formulate and solve the 3D radiative transfer problem of the polarization of the solar continuous radiation. Our approach takes into account not only the anisotropy of the continuum radiation, but also the symmetry-breaking effects caused by the horizontal atmospheric inhomogeneities produced by the solar surface convection. Interestingly, our radiative transfer modeling in a well-known 3D hydrodynamical model of the solar photosphere shows remarkable agreement with the empirical data, significantly better than that obtained via the use of 1D atmospheric models. Although this result confirms that the above-mentioned 3D model was indeed a suitable choice for our Hanle-effect estimation of the substantial amount of ""hidden"" magnetic energy that is stored in the quiet solar photosphere, we have found however some small discrepancies whose origin may be due to uncertainties in the empirical data and/or in the thermal and density structure of the 3D model. For this reason, we have paid some attention also to other (more familiar) observables, like the center-limb variation of the continuum intensity, which we have calculated taking into account the scattering contribution to the continuum source function. The overall agreement with the observed center-limb variation turns out to be impressive, but we find a hint that the model's temperature gradients in the continuum forming layers could be slightly too steep, perhaps because all current simulations of solar surface convection and magnetoconvection compute the radiative flux divergence ignoring the fact that the effective polarizability is not completely negligible, especially in the downward-moving intergranular lane plasma.",Astronomy

2119,119.0,"V838 Mon erupted at the beginning of 2002 becoming an extremely luminous star. Among various scenarios proposed to explain the nature of the outburst the most promising is a stellar merger event. In this paper we investigate the observational properties of the star and its surroundings in the post outburst phase. We have obtained a high resolution optical spectrum of V838 Mon in October 2005 using the Keck I telescope.We have identified numerous atomic features and molecular bands present in the spectrum and provided an atlas of those features. In order to improve the spectrum interpretation we have performed simple modeling of the molecular bands. Our analysis indicates that the spectrum is dominated by molecular absorption features arising in photospheric regions with temperatures of ~2400 K and in colder outer layers, where the temperature decreases down to ~500 K. A number of resonance lines of neutral alkali metals are observed to show P-Cyg profiles. Particularly interesting are numerous prominent emission lines of [FeII]. All of them show practically the same profile, which can be well described by a Lorentzian profile. In the blue part of the spectrum photospheric signatures of the B-type companion are easily seen. We have fitted the observed spectrum with a synthetic one and the obtained parameters are consistent with the B3V type.

2120,298.0,"GJ 436b is a Neptune-size planet with 23.2 Earth masses in an elliptical orbit of period 2.64 days and eccentricity 0.16. With a typical tidal dissipation factor (Q' ~ 10^6) as that of a giant planet with convective envelope, its orbital circularization timescale under internal tidal dissipation is around 1 Gyr, at least two times less than the stellar age (&gt;3 Gyr). A plausible mechanism is that the eccentricity of GJ 436b is modulated by a planetary companion due to their mutual perturbation. Here we investigate this possibility from the dynamical viewpoint. A general method is given to predict the possible locations of the dynamically coupled companions, including in nearby/distance non-resonant or mean motion resonance orbits with the first planet. Applying the method to GJ 436 system, we find it is very unlikely that the eccentricity of GJ 436b is maintained at the present location by a nearby/distance companion through secular perturbation or mean motion resonance. In fact, in all these simulated cases, GJ 436b will undergo eccentricity damp and orbital decay, leaving the present location within the stellar age. However, these results do not rule out the possible existence of planet companions in nearby/distance orbits, although they are not able to maintain the eccentricity of GJ 436b.",Astronomy
2121,712.0,"The trend of ecological thought in Europe has always differed somewhat from that which is at the time in vogue in America. It is peculiarly important, therefore, that American ecologists keep as close an understanding as possible of what is going on across the water. For this purpose the little volume by BRAUN-BLANQUET' is most admirable. His citation of literature is extensive, and extends right up to the date of publication. The very active Scandinavian and Russian ecologists are freely quoted, and much American research is reviewed. The book is a detailed summary of research methods, in fact, together with a critical evaluation of each proposal, and much sound philosophizing. The introductory page points out the difference between studies of the individual organism and studies of communities. Choosing for this volume the second viewpoint, plant sociology is defined as the study of all the phenomena that have to do with the life of plants in social units. Section I discusses commensalism very briefly, and competition at length. Section II, the remainder of the book, presents in order the five principal problems of plant sociology: (i) organization or structure of communities; (2) synecologv, the relation of communities to one another and to the rest of the environment; (3) syngenetics, the origin and decline of plant communities; (4) synchorology, the occurrence and distribution of communities; (5) classification of communities (systematics).

It discusses Bourdieu’s key concepts – habitus, field, capital and illusio – and their contribution to theorizations of the interaction between structure and agency in sociological and philosophical debates. Considerable attention is paid to the relationship between Bourdieu’s reflexive sociology and the emergent interest in the ethnographic tradition within translation and interpreting studies, particularly the influence of the interpretive approach of Geertz and the subsequent work of Clifford and Marcus within the culturalist paradigm. The question of methodology is addressed in relation to Bourdieu’s reflexive sociology and the construction of the ‘object’ of sociological research. The article further explore show Bourdieu’s concepts may be made to work empirically within translation and interpreting research and how much this depend son embracing Bourdieu’s ontological and epistemological stance.

Accordingly, by drawing on the broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions, we explain how individuals' positivity can result in their flourishment and development in any aspect of life, including L2 learning and teaching. Then, we introduce and conceptualize seven instances of positive psychology variables, namely academic engagement, emotion regulation, enjoyment, grit, loving pedagogy, resilience, and well-being and explain how these positive factors contribute to desirable L2 learning and teaching experiences. Subsequently, potential theoretical and pedagogical implications are drawn to enhance the quality and effectiveness of language education systems and their respective stakeholders. In the end, the limitations of the studies in this area are explicated, and suggestions for future research are provided to expand the extant literature on positive psychology in the domain of L2 education.",Psychology

2127,770.0,"Although trust is an underdeveloped concept in sociology, promising theoretical formulations are available in the recent work of Luhmann and Barber. This sociological version complements the psychological and attitudinal conceptualizations of experimental and survey researchers. Trust is seen to include both emotional and cognitive dimensions and to function as a deep assumption underwriting social order. Contemporary examples such as lying, family exchange, monetary attitudes, and litigation illustrate the centrality of trust as a sociological reality. In recent years, sociologists have begun to treat trust as a sociological topic (e.g., Conviser; Garfinkel; Haas and Deseran; Henslin; Holzner; Strub and Priest; Weigert,a,b). Indeed, two short and powerful books, Niklas Luhmann's Trust and Pauoer (1979) and Bernard Barber's The Logic and Limits of Trust (1983), have placed trust at the center of sociological theorizing about contemporary society. Nevertheless, we agree with Luhmann's lament that there is a ""regrettably sparse literature which has trust as its main theme within sociology"" (8). There is a large quantity of research on trust by experimental psychologists and political scientists, which, however, appears theoretically unintegrated and incomplete from the standpoint of a sociology of trust. These researchers typically conceptualize trust as a psychological event within the individual rather than as an intersubjective or systemic social reality. They also tend to use methodological approaches that reduce trust to its cognitive content through psychometric scaling techniques or to its behavioral expressions in laboratory settings. Luhmann and Barber, on the other hand, present trust as an irreducible and multidimiensional so",Sociology

For solar abundance, Mixing Lenght Theory models have been calibrated by using the results of 2D radiative-hydrodynamical models (MLTa2D), that result to be very similar to those computed with non-grey ATLAS9 atmosphere boundary condition and full spectrum of turbolence (FST) convection model both in the atmosphere and in the interior (NEMO--FST models). While MLTa2D models are not available for lower metallicities, we extend to lower Z the NEMO--FST models, in the educated guess that in such a way we are simulating also at smaller Z the results of MLTa2D. We present PMS models for low mass stars from 0.1 to 1.5 Mo for metallicities [Fe/H]= -0.5, -1.0 and -2.0. The calculations include the most recent interior physics and the latest generation of non-grey atmosphere models.

2129,279.0,"Previous fits of sterile neutrino dark matter models to cosmological data assumed a peculiar production mechanism, which is not representative of the best-motivated particle physics models given current data on neutrino oscillations. These analyses ruled out sterile neutrino masses smaller than 8-10 keV. Here we focus on sterile neutrinos produced resonantly. We show that their cosmological signature can be approximated by that of mixed Cold plus Warm Dark Matter (CWDM). We use recent results on LambdaCWDM models to show that for each mass greater than or equal to 2 keV, there exists at least one model of sterile neutrino accounting for the totality of dark matter, and consistent with Lyman-alpha and other cosmological data. Resonant production occurs in the framework of the nuMSM (the extension of the Standard Model with three right-handed neutrinos). The models we checked to be allowed correspond to parameter values consistent with neutrino oscillation data, baryogenesis and all other dark matter bounds.",Astronomy
2130,738.0,"Emerging in the 1980s, maturing in the 1990s and taking-off in the 2000s, historical sociology has become a major feature of contemporary International Relations (IR) theory. However, the origins of historical sociology run much deeper than this. Indeed, historical sociology can be seen as at least two centuries old – an attempt by economists, philosophers of history and nascent sociologists to provide a historically sensitive, yet generally applicable, account of the emergence of industrial capitalism, the rational bureaucratic state, novel forms of warfare and other core features of the modern world (introductions to the field include Abrams 1982; Skocpol ed. 1984; Smith 1991; Delanty & Isin eds. 2003; Mahoney & Rueschemeyer 2003). Although the place of historical sociology within Sociology suffered from that discipline’s diversion into abstract theorizing and its turf-wars with cognate rivals, historical sociology experienced something of a renaissance during the late 1970s and early 1980s, around the time that a wave of self-consciously historical sociological work began to appear in IR. Over the past twenty years, historical sociology in International Relations (HSIR) has contributed to a number of debates ranging from examination of the origins of the modern states-system (Rosenberg 1994; Spruyt 1994; Teschke 2003) to unraveling the core features and relative novelty of the contemporary historical period (Shaw 2000; Buzan & Little 2000; Rosenberg 2005). However, as it has developed, so HSIR has become increasingly “catholic” in its tastes, often presenting itself as a loose approach representing almost any work which contains either historical or sociological sensibilities (Lawson 2007). In short, even as substantial gains have been made, there has been a concomitant watering down of the underlying approach itself. Paradoxically, there-",Sociology

These models distinguish between qualitatively different modes of information processing in making decisions and solving problems (e.g., associative versus rule-based, controlled versus uncontrolled, and affective versus cognitive modes). Leading contributors review the basic assumptions of these approaches and review the ways they have been applied and tested in such areas as attitudes, stereotyping, person perception, memory, and judgment.

While traditional sociology of knowledge asked how, and to what extent, “social factors” might influence the products of the mind, SSK sought to show that knowledge was constitutively social, and in so doing, it raised fundamental questions about taken-for-granted divisions between “social versus cognitive, or natural, factors.” This piece traces the historical development of the sociology of scientific knowledge and its relations with sociology and cultural inquiry as a whole. It identifies dominant “localist” sensibilities in SSK and the consequent problem it now confronts of how scientific knowledge travels.

2133,178.0,"We present a parameter study of the magnetohydrodynamical dynamo driven by cosmic rays in the interstellar medium (ISM) focusing on the efficiency of magnetic field amplification and the issue of energy equipartition between magnetic, kinetic and cosmic ray (CR) energies. We perform numerical CR-MHD simulations of the ISM using the extended version of ZEUS-3D code in the shearing box approximation and taking into account the presence of Ohmic resistivity, tidal forces and vertical disk gravity. CRs are supplied in randomly distributed supernova (SN) remnants and are described by the diffusion-advection equation, which incorporates an anisotropic diffusion tensor. The azimuthal magnetic flux and total magnetic energy are amplified depending on a particular choice of model parameters. We find that the most favorable conditions for magnetic field amplification correspond to magnetic diffusivity of the order of $3\times 10^{25} \cm^2\s^{-1}$, SN rates close to those observed in the Milky Way, periodic SN activity corresponding to spiral arms, and highly anisotropic and field-aligned CR diffusion. The rate of magnetic field amplification is relatively insensitive to the magnitude of SN rates in a rage of spanning 10% up to 100% of realistic values. The timescale of magnetic field amplification in the most favorable conditions is 150 Myr, at galactocentric radius equal to 5 kpc. The final magnetic field energies fluctuate near equipartition with the gas kinetic energy. In all models CR energy exceeds the equipartition values by a least an order of magnitude, in contrary to the expected equipartition. We suggest that the excess of cosmic rays can be attributed to the fact that the shearing-box does not permit cosmic rays to leave the system along the horizontal magnetic field.",Astronomy

2137,292.0,"The interaction of microquasar jets with their environment can produce non-thermal radiation as is the case for extragalactic outflows impacting on their surroundings. We have developed an analytical model based on those successfully applied to extragalactic sources. The jet is taken to be a supersonic and mildly relativistic hydrodynamical outflow. We focus on the jet/shocked medium structure when being in its adiabatic phase, and assume that it grows in a self-similar way. We calculate the fluxes and spectra of the radiation produced via synchrotron, Inverse Compton and relativistic Bremsstrahlung processes by electrons accelerated in strong shocks. A hydrodynamical simulation is also performed to further investigate the jet interaction with the environment and check the physical parameters used in the analytical model. We conclude that microquasar jet termination regions could be detectable at radio wavelengths for current instruments sensitive to arcminute scales while at X-rays the expected luminosities are moderate, although the emitter is more compact than the radio one. The radiation at gamma-ray energies may be within the detection limits of the next generation of satellite and ground-based instruments.",Astronomy

First, unlike the American literature, work in Britain has not been dominated by fruitless efforts to find the characteristics that differentiate professions from other occupations. Second, the British literature contains four distinctive characteristics that differentiate it from the American literature. They are a focus on inter- and intraprofessional conflicts, the relationship between the professions and the polity, the link between the professions and social stratification, and theoretical roots in the classic ideas of observers such as Marx and Weber. Third, the realities examined in the British literature lead us to conclude that the professions will continue to be an active social force.

It is proposed that such penalties are illuminated in markets that are significantly mediated by product critics. In particular, it is argued that failure to gain reviews by the critics who specialize in a product's intended category reflects confusion over the product's identity and that such illegitimacy should depress demand. The validity of this assertion is tested among public American firms in the stock market over the years 1985–94. It is shown that the stock price of an American firm was discounted to the extent that the firm was not covered by the securities analysts who specialized in its industries.

The social intuitionist model is presented as an alternative to rationalist models.

2150,5.0,"We investigate the biases and uncertainties in estimates of physical parameters of high-redshift Lyman break galaxies (LBGs), such as stellar mass, mean stellar population age, and star formation rate (SFR), obtained from broad-band photometry. By combining LCDM hierarchical structure formation theory, semi-analytic treatments of baryonic physics, and stellar population synthesis models, we construct model galaxy catalogs from which we select LBGs at redshifts z ~ 3.4, 4.0, and 5.0. The broad-band spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of these model LBGs are then analysed by fitting galaxy template SEDs derived from stellar population synthesis models with smoothly declining SFRs. We compare the statistical properties of LBGs' physical parameters -- such as stellar mass, SFR, and stellar population age -- as derived from the best-fit galaxy templates with the intrinsic values from the semi-analytic model. We find some trends in these distributions: first, when the redshift is known, SED-fitting methods reproduce the input distributions of LBGs' stellar masses relatively well, with a minor tendency to underestimate the masses overall, but with substantial scatter. Second, there are large systematic biases in the distributions of best-fit SFRs and mean ages, in the sense that single-component SED-fitting methods underestimate SFRs and overestimate ages. We attribute these trends to the different star formation histories predicted by the semi-analytic models and assumed in the galaxy templates used in SED-fitting procedure, and to the fact that light from the current generation of star-formation can hide older generations of stars. These biases, which arise from the SED-fitting procedure, can significantly affect inferences about galaxy evolution from broadband photometry.",Astronomy

Using a novel scheme to model the physics and spectral signatures of gaseous winds from these objects, we are able to estimate the mass loss rates and kinetic luminosities associated with the highly ionized gas and investigate its physical properties. Our conclusions are as follows: 1) There is a strong indication that the outflowing gas in those objects is multi-phase with similar kinematics for the different phases. 2) The X-ray spectrum is consistent with such flows being thermally driven from ~pc scales, and are therefore unlikely to be associated with the inner accretion disk. 3) The underlying X-ray spectrum consists of a hard X-ray powerlaw which is similar for all objects shining below their Eddington rate and a soft excess whose contribution becomes more prominent for objects shining close to their Eddington limit. 4) The physical properties of the outflow are similar in all cases and a coherent picture emerges concerning its physical properties. 5) The deduced mass loss rates are, roughly, of the order of the mass accretion rate in those objects so that the kinetic luminosity carried by such winds is only a tiny fraction (&lt;&lt;1%) of the bolometric luminosity.

There is much talk of medicine without borders and sociology without borders. These social developments are obviously linked to the processes of globalization, leading some to argue that we need a `sociology beyond society' in order to account for these flows and global networks. In this article, I propose an alternative analysis. There are important developments involving the securitization of modern societies that create significant forms of immobility. One striking illustration is the increasing use of walls to quarantine or secure territories and communities against outsiders or to regulate the flow of migrants in Israel, in Europe and along the Mexican-US border. Modern societies are in particular characterized by a deep contradiction between the economic need for labour mobility and the state's political need to assert sovereignty. Gated societies, ghettoes, quarantine zones, prisons, camps and similar arrangements are in many respects pre-modern institutions of spatial regulation for political ends. Contemporary technical developments in biomedicine offer new opportunities for political control and spatial regulation in terms of forensic policing, bio-tattooing and bioprofiling. Globalization paradoxically produces significant forms of immobility for political regulation of persons alongside the mobility of goods and services.",Sociology

2171,479.0,"Like other scientists, psychologists believe experimental replication to be the final arbiter for determining the validity of an empirical finding. Reports in psychology journals often attempt to prove the validity of a hypothesis or theory with multiple experiments that replicate a finding. Unfortunately, these efforts are sometimes misguided because in a field like experimental psychology, ever more successful replication does not necessarily ensure the validity of an empirical finding. When psychological experiments are analyzed with statistics, the rules of probability dictate that random samples should sometimes be selected that do not reject the null hypothesis, even if an effect is real. As a result, it is possible for a set of experiments to have too many successful replications. When there are too many successful replications for a given set of experiments, a skeptical scientist should be suspicious that null or negative findings have been suppressed, the experiments were run improperly, or the experiments were analyzed improperly. This article describes the implications of this observation and demonstrates how to test for too much successful replication by using a set of experiments from a recent research paper.",Psychology

This is particularly surprising because much of the literature on the determinants of taxation bears directly on the debates in political sociology about the social, political, institutional, and other determinants of government policy. This essay reviews and integrates the literature on tax policy formation and relates it to these general debates. It also explores some of the important but often neglected effects that taxation has on such phenomena as political revolution, state building, economic organization, labor force participation, and philanthropy. Thus, this essay demonstrates the significance and reviews recent developments in fiscal sociology.",Sociology

Theory and research have focused almost exclusively on a personality approach to creativity and, to a lesser extent, a cognitive-abilities approach. Following a consideration of the definition and assessment of creativity, a componential framework for conceptualizing creativity is presented here. Including domain-relevant skills, creativity-relevant skills, and task motivation as a set of necessary and sufficient components of creativity, the framework describes the way in which cognitive abilities, personality characteristics, and social factors might contribute to different stages of the creative process. The discussion emphasizes the previously neglected social factors and highlights the contributions that a social psychology of creativity can make to a comprehensive view of creative performance. A striking feature of many phenomenological accounts of creativity is the degree to which outstandingly creative individuals feel influenced by social and environmental factors. In many cases, these factors are quite ordinary, mundane events; it appears that even seemingly insignificant features of the environment can be detrimental or conducive to creativity in some individuals. For example, in a letter to a friend, Tchaikovsky (1906) described the devastating effect that",Psychology

2181,135.0,"The existence of large-scale dynamos in rigidly rotating turbulent convection without shear is studied using three-dimensional numerical simulations of penetrative rotating compressible convection. We demonstrate that rotating convection in a Cartesian domain can drive a large-scale dynamo even in the absence of shear. The large-scale field contains a significant fraction of the total field in the saturated state. The simulation results are compared with one-dimensional mean-field dynamo models where turbulent transport coefficients, as determined using the test field method, are used. The reason for the absence of large-scale dynamo action in earlier studies is shown to be due to the rotation being too slow: whereas the alpha-effect can change sign, its magnitude stays approximately constant as a function of rotation, and the turbulent diffusivity decreases monotonically with increasing rotation. Only when rotation is rapid enough a large-scale dynamo can be excited. The one-dimensional mean-field model with dynamo coefficients from the test field results predicts reasonably well the dynamo excitation in the direct simulations. This result further validates the test field procedure and reinforces the interpretation that the observed dynamo is driven by a turbulent alpha-effect. This result demonstrates the existence of an alpha-effect and an alpha^2-dynamo with natural forcing.",Astronomy

Emotion regulation determines the offset of emotional responding and is thus distinct from emotional sensitivity, which determines the onset of emotional responding. Among the most viable categories for classifying emotion-regulation strategies are the targets and functions of emotion regulation. The emotion-generating systems that are targeted in emotion regulation include attention, knowledge, and bodily responses. The functions of emotion regulation include satisfying hedonic needs, supporting specific goal pursuits, and facilitating the global personality system. Emotion-regulation strategies are classified in terms of their targets and functions and relevant empirical work is reviewed. Throughout this review, emotion regulation emerges as one of the most far-ranging and influential processes at the interface of cognition and emotion.",Psychology

2186,791.0,"Endogenous selection bias is a central problem for causal inference. Recognizing the problem, however, can be difficult in practice. This article introduces a purely graphical way of characterizing endogenous selection bias and of understanding its consequences (Hernán et al. 2004). We use causal graphs (direct acyclic graphs, or DAGs) to highlight that endogenous selection bias stems from conditioning (e.g., controlling, stratifying, or selecting) on a so-called collider variable, i.e., a variable that is itself caused by two other variables, one that is (or is associated with) the treatment and another that is (or is associated with) the outcome. Endogenous selection bias can result from direct conditioning on the outcome variable, a post-outcome variable, a post-treatment variable, and even a pre-treatment variable. We highlight the difference between endogenous selection bias, common-cause confounding, and overcontrol bias and discuss numerous examples from social stratification, cultural sociology, social network analysis, political sociology, social demography, and the sociology of education.",Sociology

2192,448.0,"The urge to move in response to music, combined with the positive affect associated with the coupling of sensory and motor processes while engaging with music (referred to as sensorimotor coupling) in a seemingly effortless way, is commonly described as the feeling of being in the groove. Here, we systematically explore this compelling phenomenon in a population of young adults. We utilize multiple levels of analysis, comprising phenomenological, behavioral, and computational techniques. Specifically, we show (a) that the concept of the groove is widely appreciated and understood in terms of a pleasurable drive toward action, (b) that a broad range of musical excerpts can be appraised reliably for the degree of perceived groove, (c) that the degree of experienced groove is inversely related to experienced difficulty of bimanual sensorimotor coupling under tapping regimes with varying levels of expressive constraint, (d) that high-groove stimuli elicit spontaneous rhythmic movements, and (e) that quantifiable measures of the quality of sensorimotor coupling predict the degree of experienced groove. Our results complement traditional discourse regarding the groove, which has tended to take the psychological phenomenon for granted and has focused instead on the musical and especially the rhythmic qualities of particular genres of music that lead to the perception of groove. We conclude that groove can be treated as a psychological construct and model system that allows for experimental exploration of the relationship between sensorimotor coupling with music and emotion.",Psychology

Second, we look at how sociologists bring sexuality into conversation with the black feminist notion of “intersectionality” by examining the nature and effects of sexuality among multiple and intersecting systems of identity and oppression. A third trend in the sociology of sexuality has been to explore the relationships between sexuality and political economy in light of recent market transformations. In examining these trends, we observe the influence of globalization studies and the contributions of sociologists to understanding the role of sexuality in global processes.

In this article, the term is used to characterize heterosexuals' negative attitudes toward (a) homosexual behavior, (b) people with a homosexual or bisexual orientation, and (c) communities of gay, lesbian, and bisexual people. Sexual prejudice is a preferable term to homophobia because it conveys no assumptions about the motivations underlying negative attitudes, locates the study of attitudes concerning sexual orientation within the broader context of social psychological research on prejudice, and avoids value judgments about such attitudes. Sexual prejudice remains widespread in the United States, although moral condemnation has decreased in the 1990s and opposition to antigay discrimination has increased.

2196,521.0,"Although there is a voluminous psychological literature on performance evaluation (PE), surprisingly little of this research examines the consequences of linking pay to evaluated performance in work settings. Rather, PE research has been dominated by cognitive processing, measurement, and construct validity issues. At the same time, a large literature on pay-for-performance (PFP) linkages does exist, but most of it has been conducted in disciplines other than psychology. We think this pattern should change. To this end, we briefly trace the origins of the general separation of PE research from PFP research in psychology. From there, we review recent research on the relationship between PE and performance improvement, particularly with respect to multisource or 360-degree evaluation. We then turn to research on various PFP systems, such as merit pay and individual and group incentives. We conclude with suggestions as to how psychological research can make useful contributions to knowledge of PE, PFP, and performance improvement.",Psychology
2197,968.0,"Imagined futures, once a vital topic of theoretical inquiry within the sociology of culture, have been sidelined in recent decades. Rational choice models cannot explain the seemingly irrational optimism of youth aspirations, pointing to the need to explore other alternatives. This article incorporates insights from pragmatist theory and cognitive sociology to examine the relationship between imagined futures and present actions and experiences in rural Malawi, where future optimism appears particularly unfounded. Drawing from in-depth interviews and archival sources documenting ideological campaigns promoting schooling, the author shows that four elements are understood to jointly produce educational success: ambitious career goals, sustained effort, unflagging optimism, and resistance to temptation. Aspirations should be interpreted not as rational calculations, but instead as assertions of a virtuous identity, claims to be “one who aspires.”",Sociology
2198,701.0,"The category of astronomical time is only one of several concepts of time. Such concepts differ in the fields of philosophy, psychology, and economics. An operational definition of expressions of time in common usage shows that social phenomena are frequently adopted as a frame of reference so that units of time are often fixed by the rhythm of collective life. The need for social collaboration is at the root of social systems of time. Social time is qualitatively differentiated according to the beliefs and customs common to the group. Social time is not continuous but is interrupted by critical dates. All calendrical systems arise from and are perpetuated by social requirements. They arise from social differentiation and a widening area of social interaction. It is possible that the introduction of social time as a methodological category would enhance the discovery of social periodicities. No concept of motion is possible without he category of time. In mechanics, for example, time is considered the independent variable which is a continuous function of the three co-ordinates which determine the position of a particle. Time is likewise a necessary variable in social change. The adequacy of the concepts of astronomical or calendrical time in the study of the motion or change of social phenomena thus represents a problem of basic importance. Are periods of years, months, weeks, days the only, or even the most readily applicable, temporal measures in a system of social dynamics? Most social scientists have proceeded on the tacit assumption that no system of time other than those of astronomy or the imperfectly related calendar is possible or, if possible, useful.

All these theories have in common the distinction between cognitive processes that are fast, automatic, and unconscious and those that are slow, deliberative, and conscious. A number of authors have recently suggested that there may be two architecturally (and evolutionarily) distinct cognitive systems underlying these dual-process accounts. However, it emerges that (a) there are multiple kinds of implicit processes described by different theorists and (b) not all of the proposed attributes of the two kinds of processing can be sensibly mapped on to two systems as currently conceived. It is suggested that while some dual-process theories are concerned with parallel competing processes involving explicit and implicit knowledge systems, others are concerned with the influence of preconscious processes that contextualize and shape deliberative reasoning and decision-making.",Psychology

Since these flows sit in deep relativistic gravitational potentials, their random bulk motions approach the speed of light, therefore allowing turbulent Comptonization to be an important effect. We show that the inevitable production of hard X-ray photons results from turbulent Comptonization in the limit where the turbulence is trans-sonic and the accretion power approaches the Eddington Limit. In this regime, the turbulent Compton y-parameter approaches unity and the turbulent Compton temperature is a significant fraction of the electron rest mass energy, in agreement with the observed phenomena.",Astronomy

For brevity we will often refer to the subject simply as writing, but the term should not be taken too literally.

The mental activities of writing considered in our research are the same kinds of higher mental processes that figure in cognitive research on all aspects of human intelligence. They include goal setting, planning, memory search, problem solving, evaluation, and diagnosis. Writing is, of course, easily recognized as an activity in which a good deal of human intelligence is put to use. Its neglect, until very recently, by cognitive scientists is, however, easy to understand. Cognitive research has been gradually working its way from well-defined to ill-defined problems, from tasks that draw on limited knowledge to tasks that draw on large bodies of knowledge, and from tasks that are easily constrained experimentally to ones that are more susceptible to intentions of the participants.

In this paper we develop a variation of the direct imaging correlator we call the MOFF correlator. The MOFF correlator shares the computational advantages of a direct imaging correlator, while avoiding a number of its shortcomings. In particular the MOFF correlator makes no constraints on the antenna arrangement or type, provides a fully calibrated output image including widefield polarimetry and non-coplanar baseline effects, and can be orders-of-magnitude more efficient than XF or FX correlators for compact radio cosmology arrays.",Astronomy

Thus far, no one has been able to offer a definition which, without vagueness and yet with sufficient comprehensiveness, has told once for all what religion is in its essence, in that which is common alike to the religion of Christians and South Sea islanders, to Buddhism and Mexican idolatry. Thus far it has not been distinguished, on the one hand, from mere metaphysical speculation, nor, on the other, from the credulity which believes in ""ghosts."" Its purest and highest manifestations are not yet proof against comparison with these. And the multiplicity of psychological causes to which religion is ascribed corresponds to this indefinite conception as to its nature. It matters not whether fear or love, ancestor-worship or self-deification, the moral instincts or the feeling of dependence, be regarded as the subjective root of religion; a theory is only then entirely erroneous when it assumes to be the sole explanation, and then only correct when it claims to point out merely one of the sources of religion. Hence the solution of the problem will be approached only when all the impulses, ideas, and conditions operating in this domain are inventoried, and that with the express determination that the significance of known particular motives is not to be arbitrarily expanded into general laws.

Combining the 192 ESSENCE data with the observational $H(z)$ data to constrain a parameterized deceleration parameter, we obtain the best fit values of transition redshift and current deceleration parameter $z_{T}=0.632^{+0.256}_{-0.127}$, $q_{0}=-0.788^{+0.182}_{-0.182}$. Furthermore, using $\Lambda$CDM model and two model-independent equation of state of dark energy, we find that the combined constraint from the 192 ESSENCE data and other four cosmological observations gives smaller values of $\Omega_{0m}$ and $q_{0}$, but a larger value of $z_{T}$ than the combined constraint from the 182 Gold data with other four observations. Finally, according to the Akaike information criterion it is shown that the recently observed data equally supports three dark energy models: $\Lambda$CDM, $w_{de}(z)=w_{0}$ and $w_{de}(z)=w_{0}+w_{1}\ln(1+z)$.",Astronomy
2212,639.0,"The sociology of childhood has been used increasingly as a theoretical perspective in early childhood education since the late 1980s. In Australia, those who draw on the sociology of childhood have tended to use it in similar ways to European counterparts, being guided by six major tenets identified by Prout and James (1997) that form the basis of the sociology of childhood. These include the notion that childhood is a social construction, that childhood is a variable of social analysis and is closely connected to other variables such as class and gender, and that children's relationships and cultures are worthy of study in their own right (p. 8). Further, children are considered as active (rather than passive) agents in their daily lives and to be competent and knowledgeable about their own lives (p. 8). Although the sociology of childhood is comparatively young, there has been little analysis of the key tenets of the position. Morss is an exception and raises some fundamental issues for consideration, which include refining the notion of the 'socially constructed child', a term that is used widely in much that written about the sociology of childhood.",Sociology

2215,44.0,"In a novel approach to studying viscous accretion flows, viscosity has been introduced as a perturbative effect, involving a first-order correction in the $\alpha$-viscosity parameter. This method reduces the problem of solving a second-order nonlinear differential equation (Navier-Stokes equation) to that of an effective first-order equation. Viscosity breaks down the invariance of the equilibrium conditions for stationary inflow and outflow solutions, and distinguishes accretion from wind. Under a dynamical systems classification, the only feasible critical points of this ""quasi-viscous"" flow are saddle points and spirals. A linearised and radially propagating time-dependent perturbation gives rise to secular instability on large spatial scales of the disc. Further, on these same length scales, the velocity evolution equation of the quasi-viscous flow has been transformed to bear a formal closeness with Schr\""odinger's equation with a repulsive potential. Compatible with the transport of angular momentum to the outer regions of the disc, a viscosity-limited length scale has been defined for the full spatial extent over which the accretion process would be viable.",Astronomy

Extending a previous analysis of the gravitational lensing phenomenology to a new set of 28 stars, whose orbits have been well determined by recent observations, we have calculated all the properties of their secondary images, including time and magnitude of their luminosity peaks and their angular distances from the central black hole. The best lensing candidate is represented by the star S6, since the magnitude of its secondary image at the peak reaches K=20.8, with an angular separation of 0.3 mas from the central black hole, that is just at the borders of the resolution limit in the K band of incoming astronomical instruments.",Astronomy

2222,861.0,"What is an ‘information professional’? For that matter, what is a ‘professional’? These questions are awkward because they are difficult to answer with precision or certainty. ‘The professions’ have been an object of study by sociologists for many decades, but only one author has meaningfully ventured into the information professions. The System of Professions is now somewhat elderly, but the foundational theory developed here is very well-suited to a field like Information – weakly delineated and continually evolving. The purpose of this review is to explore whether this classic sociological work, following its thirtieth birthday, might have new relevance to students and practitioners of both traditional and emerging information professions, given their rapidly changing work environments. Andrew Abbott is a professor of Sociology at the University of Chicago, and he served as the long-time editor of the American Journal of Sociology (2000–2016). This was his first book, notably winning the prestigious American Sociology Association’s Distinguished Scholarly Book Award (1991). Abbott’s own doctoral research had focused on the emergence of psychiatry as a profession; it was from this work that he abstracted his general conceptual model of professions as a ‘survival-of-thefittest’ ecology, and one that is set in a frequently changing social, epistemological, and technical landscape. Abbott’s distinctive contribution to the discourse is to methodically define professions wholly in terms of an elbows-out application of expertise; professions compete with each other for expertise-based jurisdiction over solvable problems.

2223,800.0,"An alternative approach to understanding innovation is made using two intersecting ideas. The first is that successful innovation requires consideration of the social and organizational contexts in which it is located. The complex context of construction work is characterized by inter-organizational collaboration, a project-based approach and power distributed amongst collaborating organizations. The second is that innovations can be divided into two modes: ‘bounded’, where the implications of innovation are restricted within a single, coherent sphere of influence, and ‘unbounded’, where the effects of implementation spill over beyond this. Bounded innovations are adequately explained within the construction literature. However, less discussed are unbounded innovations, where many firms' collaboration is required for successful implementation, even though many innovations can be considered unbounded within construction's inter-organizational context. It is argued that unbounded innovations require an approach to understand and facilitate the interactions both within a range of actors and between the actors and technological artefacts. The insights from a sociology of technology approach can be applied to the multiplicity of negotiations and alignments that constitute the implementation of unbounded innovation. The utility of concepts from the sociology of technology, including ‘system building’ and ‘heterogeneous engineering’, is demonstrated by applying them to an empirical study of an unbounded innovation on a major construction project (the new terminal at Heathrow Airport, London, UK). This study suggests that ‘system building’ contains outcomes that are not only transformations of practices, processes and systems, but also the potential transformation of technologies themselves.",Sociology

Recently, by studying 6 lensing systems, Ferreras et al. (2008) claimed that MOND still needs dark matter even in galactic scales. When we study the same systems, however, we yield an opposite conclusion. In this contribution, we report our result and conclude that MOND does not need dark matter in galactic lensing systems.

Next I discuss the major role of diagnosis in social construction, leading to the need for a sociology of diagnosis. I emphasize controversial and conflictual diagnoses, as a first step toward a more general sociology of diagnosis. Then I put forth a typology of social construction, involving four combinations based on whether a condition is generally accepted and whether a biomedical definition is applied. Next I detail a series of stages in the social construction of a condition. In that process, my primary concern is the initial social discovery, which is essentially a matter of diagnosis, with a secondary emphasis on illness experience. This is followed by stages of treatment and outcome, which recursively affect social construction. I conclude by noting the health policy implications of the social constructionist perspective.",Sociology
2226,822.0,"There is a strong tendency in the social sciences to understand and conceptualize the new information technologies in terms of their technical properties and to construct the relation to the sociological world as one of applications and impacts. Less work has gone into developing analytic categories that allow us to capture the complex imbrications of technology and society. This article addresses two particular aspects of this challenge through two organizing efforts. First, understanding the place of these new technologies from a sociological perspective requires avoiding a purely technological interpretation and recognizing the embeddedness and the variable outcomes of these technologies for different social orders. These technologies can indeed be constitutive of new social dynamics, but they can also be derivative or merely reproduce older conditions. Second, such an effort will, in turn, call for categories that capture what are now often conceived of as contradictory, or mutually exclusive, attributes. The article examines these two aspects by focusing on three analytic issues for sociology: the embeddedness of the new technologies, the complex interactions between the digital and the material world, and the mediating cultures that organize the relation between these technologies and users.",Sociology
2227,78.0,"We investigate dark matter halo properties as a function of a time--varying dark energy equation of state. The dynamics of the collapse of the halo is governed by the form of the quintessence potential, the time evolution of its equation of state, the initial conditions of the field and its homogeneity nature in the highly non--linear regime. These have a direct impact on the turnaround, virialisation and collapse times, altering in consequence the non--linear density contrast and virial radius. We compute halo concentrations using the Eke, Navarro &amp; Steinmetz algorithm, examining two extreme scenarios: first, we assume that the quintessence field does not exhibit fluctuations on cluster scales and below - homogeneous fluid; second, we assume that the field inside the overdensity collapses along with the dark matter - inhomogeneous fluid. The Eke, Navarro &amp; Steinmetz prescription reveals, in general, higher halo concentrations in inhomogeneous dark energy models than in their homogeneous equivalents. Halo concentrations appear to be controlled by both changes in formation epochs of the halo cores as well as by differing virialisation overdensities. We derive physical halo properties in all models and discuss their observational implications. We examine two possible methods for comparing observations with theoretical predictions. The first method works on galaxy cluster scales and consists of fitting the observed X-ray cluster gas density distributions to those predicted for an NFW profile. The second method works on galaxy scales and involves the observational measurement of the so--called central density parameter.",Astronomy

2238,680.0,"xAccording to Marcel Mauss’ definition, mobility is a “total” social phenomenon, in other words a lens through which may be read all of the social relationships of a given society. As early as the 1920s, Robert Park declared that “the man gifted with locomotion” is the subject of urban sociology. The idea is therefore not new but, rather, was long left fallow. Concretely, the central place of mobility in sociology was ignored until the 1970s, when it resurfaced first in urban sociology and then, more recently, in general sociology. However, this rediscovery is accompanied by a multitude of works on mobility whose scope is often very general and theoretical. In this article, we would like to seriously consider the idea that mobility is a “total” social phenomenon and, therefore, that the analysis of mobility teaches us about the composition of and changes in a society. This implies seeing mobility as a tool that must be well defined and finely tuned to be able to “read” a society. As such, we will revisit and identify common conceptual limits of understanding mobility to address the urban phenomenon. Then, using theoretical works on mobility, we will diagnose the pitfalls that a re-conceptualization of mobility must avoid. Thirdly, we will develop a new conceptual proposition based on motility. Finally, from the research findings based on this conceptualization, we will attempt to highlight its contribution to knowledge.",Sociology

2241,11.0,"We study the impact of catastrophic errors occurring in the photometric redshifts of galaxies on cosmological parameter estimates with cosmic shear tomography. We consider a fiducial survey with 9-filter set and perform photo-z measurement simulations. It is found that a fraction of 1% galaxies at z_{spec}~0.4 is misidentified to be at z_{phot}~3.5. We then employ both chi^2 fitting method and the extension of Fisher matrix formalism to evaluate the bias on the equation of state parameters of dark energy, w_0 and w_a, induced by those catastrophic outliers. By comparing the results from both methods, we verify that the estimation of w_0 and w_a from the fiducial 5-bin tomographic analyses can be significantly biased. To minimize the impact of this bias, two strategies can be followed: (A) the cosmic shear analysis is restricted to 0.5&lt;z&lt;2.5 where catastrophic redshift errors are expected to be insignificant; (B) a spectroscopic survey is conducted for galaxies with 3&lt;z_{phot}&lt;4.

2243,723.0,"This article explores the conditions under which the sociology of childhood was created, suggests some of the problems encountered in this effort and points to some possible remedies. It is argued that the construction of a sociology of childhood entailed a double task. First, space had to be created for childhood within sociological discourse. Second, the increasing complexity and ambiguity of childhood as a contemporary, destabilized phenomenon had to be confronted. It is argued that, whilst a space for childhood has been created, this was accomplished largely in terms of modernist sociology, a discourse that was increasingly unable to deal adequately with the destabilized world of late modernity. An important aspect of this problem is apparent in the reproduction within the sociology of childhood of the dichotomized oppositions that characterize modernist sociology. Three of these oppositions (agency and structure, nature and culture, being and becoming) are explored. It is suggested that moving the sociology of childhood beyond the grip of such modernist thinking entails developing a strategy for ‘including the excluded middle’. Inter alia this may necessitate greater attention to the interdisciplinarity and the hybridity of childhood; being symmetrical about how childhoods are constructed; attending to the networks, flows and mediations of its production, and the co-construction of generational relations.",Sociology

We find that the flux depends sensitively on the bag constant of the MIT bag model of QCD and disappears for high values of the bag constant and thus more compact strange stars. In the latter case strange stars could coexist with ordinary neutron stars as they are not converted by the capture of cosmic ray strangelets. An unambiguous detection of an ordinary neutron star would then not rule out the strange matter hypothesis.,Astronomy

2246,263.0,"In this thesis we study the influence of a possible variation of fundamental ""constants"" on the process of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). Our findings are combined with further studies on variations of constants in other physical processes to constrain models of grand unification (GUT) and quintessence. We will find that the 7Li problem of BBN can be ameliorated if one allows for varying constants, where especially varying light quark masses show a strong influence. Furthermore, we show that recent studies of varying constants are in contradiction with each other and BBN in the framework of six exemplary GUT scenarios, if one assumes monotonic variation with time. We conclude that there is strong tension between recent claims of varying constants, hence either some claims have to be revised, or there are much more sophisticated GUT relations (and/or non-monotonic variations) realized in nature. The methods introduced in this thesis prove to be powerful tools to probe regimes well beyond the Standard Model of particle physics or the concordance model of cosmology, which are currently inaccessible by experiments.

Events that threaten self-integrity arouse stress and self-protective defenses that can hamper performance and growth. However, an intervention known as self-affirmation can curb these negative outcomes. Self-affirmation interventions typically have people write about core personal values. The interventions bring about a more expansive view of the self and its resources, weakening the implications of a threat for personal integrity. Timely affirmations have been shown to improve education, health, and relationship outcomes, with benefits that sometimes persist for months and years. Like other interventions and experiences, self-affirmations can have lasting benefits when they touch off a cycle of adaptive potential, a positive feedback loop between the self-system and the social system that propagates adaptive outcomes over time.

For example, foods to eat on a diet might be a well-established, goal-derived category for someone who diets often, but activities to do on a vacation in Japan with one's grandmother is probably an ad hoc category for most people. Although I only address the ad hoc categories that people derive while constructing plans to achieve goals, ad hoc categories also arise in other contexts, including decision making (Kahneman & Miller, 1986), metaphor (Glucksberg & Keysar, 1990), and comparative judgment (Cech, Shoben, & Love, 1990).",Psychology

We have used light-cone simulations to show how the deprojection method successfully recovers the real space correlation function when applied to mock photometric redshift surveys. We study how the errors in the redshift determination affect the quality of the recovered two-point correlation function. Considering the expected errors associated to the planned photometric redshift surveys, we conclude that this method provides information on the clustering of matter useful for the estimation of cosmological parameters that depend on the large scale distribution of galaxies.",Astronomy

2254,353.0,"For whatever reason consciousness evolved, our awareness of ourselves in our ecological niche would be expected to be experienced as compatible. The industrial revolution challenged this compatibility because many individuals worked and lived in inhumane conditions. The technological revolution provides another (less compelling) challenge to this compatibility. Donald A. Norman's goal is to help relieve feelings of incompatibility by putting the blame on the poor design of everyday things in our environment rather than on ourselves. When we fail to deal appropriately with our environment of water faucets, doors, and VCRs, we usually blame ourselves. Norman demonstrates that much of the blame should be placed on the designer and, in so doing, illustrates once again that psychology is relevant to our everyday life. Theories developed and tested in the laboratory can be used to rationalize behavioral successes and failures in everyday life. Although the book seeks to show that the incompatibility is due to the environment and not the participant, it does not address the reason that we blame ourselves. Perhaps our psychology might also speak to this issue as well as the other.",Psychology
2255,370.0,"In this article, we approach the relationship between neoliberalism and psychological science from the theoretical perspective of cultural psychology. In the first section, we trace how engagement with neoliberal systems results in characteristic tendencies—including a radical abstraction of self from social and material context, an entrepreneurial understanding of self as an ongoing development project, an imperative for personal growth and fulfillment, and an emphasis on affect management for self-regulation—that increasingly constitute the knowledge base of mainstream psychological science. However, as we consider in the second section, psychological science is not just an observer of neoliberalism and its impact on psychological experience. Instead, by studying psychological processes independent of cultural–ecological or historical context and by championing individual growth and affective regulation as the key to optimal well-being, psychological scientists reproduce and reinforce the influence and authority of neoliberal systems. Rather than a disinterested bystander, hegemonic forms of psychological science are thoroughly implicated in the neoliberal project.",Psychology
2256,458.0,"Abstract : This volume pulls together and republishes, with some editing, updating, and additions, articles written during 1978-86 for internal use within the CIA Directorate of Intelligence. Four of the articles also appeared in the Intelligence Community journal Studies in Intelligence during that time frame. The information is relatively timeless and still relevant to the never-ending quest for better analysis. The articles are based on reviewing cognitive psychology literature concerning how people process information to make judgments on incomplete and ambiguous information. I selected the experiments and findings that seem most relevant to intelligence analysis and most in need of communication to intelligence analysts. I then translated the technical reports into language that intelligence analysts can understand and interpreted the relevance of these findings to the problems intelligence analysts face. The result is a compromise that may not be wholly satisfactory to either research psychologists or intelligence analysts. Cognitive psychologists and decision analysts may complain of oversimplification, while the non-psychologist reader may have to absorb some new terminology. Unfortunately, mental processes are so complex that discussion of them does require some specialized vocabulary.",Psychology

Independently we checked the archival data and found the features noted in A2003 were not from the effect of phase referencing by simultaneous differential VLBI but mainly from a removal of large phase change by subtracting an arbitrary fitted curve to the phase variations. The differential phase of the observed H2O masers between W49 North (W49N) and OH~43.8-0.1 did not show a sinusoidal variation with a period of one sidereal day due to a positional offset from the real celestial positions. We therefore could not reproduce the results in A2003 by a normal positional correction estimated from all time data, but could reproduce almost the same phases only for the first hour by adjusting parameters. Using the parameters, we could not suppress the large amount of phase variations for the successive time data that A2003 did not show in their paper. It is appropriate to regard the analysis in A2003 as not being proper for showing the performance of the instrument for phase referencing, which should be demonstrated by other experiments observing several pairs of continuum sources.",Astronomy
2258,964.0,"The contribution of the field of science and technology studies (STS) to mainstream sociology has so far been slim because of a misunderstanding about what it means to provide a social explanation of a piece of science or of an artifact. The type of explanation possible for religion, art or popular culture no longer works in the case of hard science or technology. This does not mean that science and technology escapes sociological explanation, but that a deep redistribution of what is a social explanation is in order. Once this misunderstanding has been clarified, it becomes interesting to measure up the challenge raised by STS to the usual epistemologies social sciences believed necessary for their undertakings. The social sciences imitate the natural sciences in a way that render them unable to profit from the type of objectivity found in the natural sciences. It is argued that by following the STS lead, social sciences may start to imitate the natural sciences in a very different fashion. Once the meanings ""social"" and ""science"" are reconfigured, the definition of what a ""social science"" is and what it can do in the political arena is considered. Again it is not by imitating the philosophers of science's ideas of what is a natural science that sociology can be made politically relevant.",Sociology

In order to obtain an analytic approximation for the intermediate coupling and transition to the Debye-Hueckel limit, we perform hypernetted-chain calculations of the free energy, internal energy, and pressure for mixtures of different ion species and introduce a correction to the LMR, which allows a smooth transition from strong to weak Coulomb coupling in agreement with the numerical results.",Astronomy
2260,750.0,"Responding to the growing gap between the sociological ethos and the world we study, the challenge of public sociology is to engage multiple publics in multiple ways. These public sociologies should not be left out in the cold, but brought into the framework of our discipline. In this way we make public sociology a visible and legitimate enterprise, and, thereby, invigorate the discipline as a whole. Accordingly, if we map out the division of sociological labor, we discover antagonistic interdependence among four types of knowledge: professional, critical, policy, and public. In the best of all worlds the flourishing of each type of sociology is a condition for the flourishing of all, but they can just as easily assume pathological forms or become victims of exclusion and subordination. This field of power beckons us to explore the relations among the four types of sociology as they vary historically and nationally, and as they provide the template for divergent individual careers. Finally, comparing disciplines points to the umbilical chord that connects sociology to the world of publics, underlining sociology's particular investment in the defense of civil society, itself beleaguered by the encroachment of markets and states.",Sociology

D ARwINIAN LITERARY STUDY has emerged only in the past 15 years or so, and its practitioners still constitute a relatively small community on the margins of the academic literary establishment. That establishment is oriented to postmodern beliefs and thus repudiates the ideas both of human nature and of objective scientific knowledge. Darwinian literary critics embrace the notion of consilience, affirm the cogency of Darwinian evolutionary theory, and assimilate the findings of Darwinian social science. They would agree with E. O. Wilson (1998) that the world constitutes a unified causal order and that knowledge itself forms an integrated field that encompasses the physical sciences, the social sciences , and the humanities. They affirm that human mental and cultural activity is constrained by the principles that regulate all biological activity, life has evolved through an adaptive process by means of natural selection, and all complex functional structure in living things has been produced by adaptation. They argue that the adapted mind produces literature and that literature reflects the structure and character of the adapted mind. To distinguish this kind of literary study from other schools that are in some way associated with ""evolutionary"" thinking, I refer to it as adaptationist or Darwinian literary study. Adaptationist literary study makes use of a variety of concepts common in other approaches to literary study-eoncepts such as point of view, realism and symbolism, character/setting/plot, thematic structure, tone, and formal organization. Adaptationist critics locate all of these concepts in relation to a structured account of human nature, and they derive that account from Darwinian social science.

For example, the threat of a loss has a greater impact on a decision than the possibility of an equivalent gain. Most people are also very sensitive to the difference between certainty and high probability and relatively insensitive to intermediate gradations of probability. The regret associated with a loss that was incurred by an action tends to be more intense than the regret associated with inaction or a missed opportunity. These observations and others of a similar character contribute to the understanding of how people make decisions and to the elucidation of some puzzles of rational choice . . . .

2270,716.0,"THAT conflict has sociological significance, inasmuch as it either produces or modifies communities of interest, unifications, organizations, is in principle never contested. On the other hand, it must appear paradoxical to the ordinary mode of thinking to ask whether conflict itself, without reference to its consequences or its accompaniments, is not a form of socialization. This seems, at first glance, to be merely a verbal question. If every reaction among men is a socialization, of course conflict must count as such, since it is one of the most intense reactions, and is logically impossible if restricted to a single element. The actually dissociating elements are the causes of the conflict -hatred and envy, want and desire. If, however, from these impulses conflict has once broken out, it is in reality the way to remove the dualism and to arrive at some form of unity, even if through annihilation of one of the parties. The case is, in a way, illustrated by the most violent symptoms of disease. They frequently represent the efforts of the organism to free itself from disorders and injuries. This is by no means equivalent merely to the triviality, si vis pacem para bellum, but it is the wide generalization of which that special case is a particular. Conflict itself is the resolution of the tension between the contraries. That it eventuates in peace is only a single, specially obvious and evident, expression of the fact that it is a conjunction of elements, an opposition, which belongs with the combination under one higher conception. This conception is characterized by the common contrast between both forms of relationship and the mere reciprocal indifference between elements. Repudiation and dissolution of social relation are also negatives, but conflict shows itself to be the positive factor in this very contrast with them; viz., shows negative factors in a unity which, in idea only, not at all in reality, is disjunctive.

Our first case study illustrates how the technique was employed in data analysis undertaken by a team of researchers in a large-scale qualitative research project.

We show how this approach, or cluster of approaches, rooted variously in conversational analysis, symbolic interactionism, network analysis, and structuralist cultural sociologies, has both responded to problems associated with the narrative turn and shed light on enduring sociological questions such as the bases of institutional authority, how inequalities are maintained and reproduced, why political challengers are sometimes able to win support, and the cultural foundations of self-interest and instrumental rationality.",Sociology

We argue in this paper that when the knowledge base of an industry is both complex and expanding and the sources of expertise are widely dispersed, the locus of innovation will be found in networks of learning, rather than in individual firms. The large-scale reliance on interorganizational collaborations in the biotechnology industry reflects a fundamental and pervasive concern with access to knowledge. We develop a network approach to organizational learning and derive firm-level, longitudinal hypotheses that link research and development alliances, experience with managing interfirm relationships, network position, rates of growth, and portfolios of collaborative activities. We test these hypotheses on a sample of dedicated biotechnology firms in the years 1990-1994.

2284,916.0,"In the light of the recent growth of artificial intelligence (AI), and of its implications for understanding human behaviour, this paper evaluates the prospects for an association between sociology and artificial intelligence. Current presumptions about the distinction between human behaviour and artificial intelligence are identified through a survey of discussions about AI and `expert systems'. These discussions exhibit a restricted view of sociological competence, a marked rhetoric of progress and a wide variation in assessments of the state of the art. By drawing upon recent themes in the social study of science, these discussions are shown to depend on certain key dichotomies and on an interpretive flexibility associated with the notions of intelligence and expertise. The range of possible associations between sociology and AI reflects the extent to which we are willing to adopt these features of AI discourse. It is suggested that one of the more important options is to view the AI phenomenon as an occasion for reassessing the central axiom of sociology that there is something distinctively `social' about human behaviour.",Sociology

We show that retrograde precession of the stellar orbits, due to the presence of a stellar cusp, induces coherent torques that amplify deviations of individual orbital eccentricities from the average, and thus drive all eccentricities away from their initial value. We investigate the instability using N-body simulations, and show that it can drive individual orbital eccentricities to significantly higher or lower values on the order of a precession time-scale. This physics is relevant for the Galactic center, where massive stars are likely to form in eccentric disks around the SgrA* black hole. We show that the observed bimodal eccentricity distribution of disk stars in the Galactic center is in good agreement with the distribution resulting from the eccentricity instability and demonstrate how the dynamical evolution of such a disk results in several of its stars acquiring high (1-e &lt; 0.1) orbital eccentricity. Binary stars on such highly eccentric orbits would get tidally disrupted by the SgrA* black hole, possibly producing both S-stars near the black hole and high-velocity stars in the Galactic halo.",Astronomy

We provide a detailed analysis of the perturbations to the recombination history of the universe and show that a perturbed version of the Peebles effective 3-level atom is sufficient for obtaining the evolution of \delta_e for comoving wavenumbers smaller than 1Mpc^{-1}. We calculate rigorously the perturbations to the Ly\alpha escape probability and show that to a good approximation it is governed by the local baryon velocity divergence. For modes shorter than the photon diffusion scale, we find that \delta_e is enhanced during recombination by a factor of roughly 5 relative to other first-order quantities sourcing the CMB anisotropies at second order. Using these results, in a companion paper we calculate the CMB bispectrum generated during recombination.",Astronomy

This matter was further developed (Bernstein, 1996), with the distinction between vertical and horizontal discourses and their various modalities introduced in the context of differentiating this mode of analysis from more 'Bourdieuan' perspectives. This present paper is concerned with filling out and extending the sketches adumbrated in earlier work in a more accessible form. The model proposed generates a language which relates the internal structure of specialised knowledges, the positional nature of their fields or arenas of practice, identity constructions and their change, and the forms of acquisition for successful performances.",Sociology
2295,549.0,"This article describes a 2-systems model that explains social behavior as a joint function of reflective and impulsive processes. In particular, it is assumed that social behavior is controlled by 2 interacting systems that follow different operating principles. The reflective system generates behavioral decisions that are based on knowledge about facts and values, whereas the impulsive system elicits behavior through associative links and motivational orientations. The proposed model describes how the 2 systems interact at various stages of processing, and how their outputs may determine behavior in a synergistic or antagonistic fashion. It extends previous models by integrating motivational components that allow more precise predictions of behavior. The implications of this reflective-impulsive model are applied to various phenomena from social psychology and beyond. Extending previous dual-process accounts, this model is not limited to specific domains of mental functioning and attempts to integrate cognitive, motivational, and behavioral mechanisms.",Psychology

2298,89.0,"We present results of a combined investigation of the spectral and kHz QPO evolution around the Z-track in GX 5-1 based on high-quality RXTE data. The Extended ADC emission model provides very good fits to the spectra, the results pointing clearly to a model for the nature of the Z-track, in agreement with previous results for the similar source GX 340+0. In this model, at the soft apex of the Z-track, the mass accretion rate Mdot is minimum and the neutron star has its lowest temperature; but as the source moves along the normal branch, the luminosity of the Comptonized emission increases, indicating that Mdot increases and the neutron star gets hotter. The measured flux f of the neutron star emission increases by a factor of ten becoming super-Eddington, and we propose that this disrupts the inner disk so forming jets. In flaring, the luminosity of the dominant Comptonized emission from the ADC is constant, while the neutron star emission increases, and we propose for the first time that flaring consists of unstable nuclear burning on the neutron star, and the measured mass accretion rate per unit area mdot at the onset of flaring agrees well with the theoretical critical value at which burning becomes unstable. There is a striking correlation between the frequencies of the kHz QPO and the ratio of the flux to the Eddington value: f/f_Edd, suggesting an explanation of the higher frequency QPO and of its variation along the Z-track. It is well known that a Keplerian orbit in the disk at this frequency corresponds to a position some distance from the neutron star; we propose that the oscillation always occurs at the inner disk edge, which moves radially outwards on the upper normal and horizontal branches as the measured increasing radiation pressure increasingly disrupts the inner disk.",Astronomy

2300,264.0,"We present high angular resolution observations of the HC$_3$N J=5--4 line from the Egg nebula, which is the archetype of protoplanetary nebulae. We find that the HC$_{\rm 3}$N emission in the approaching and receding portion of the envelope traces a clumpy hollow shell, similar to that seen in normal carbon rich envelopes. Near the systemic velocity, the hollow shell is fragmented into several large blobs or arcs with missing portions correspond spatially to locations of previously reported high--velocity outlows in the Egg nebula. This provides direct evidence for the disruption of the slowly--expanding envelope ejected during the AGB phase by the collimated fast outflows initiated during the transition to the protoplanetary nebula phase. We also find that the intersection of fast molecular outflows previously suggested as the location of the central post-AGB star is significantly offset from the center of the hollow shell. From modelling the HC$_3$N distribution we could reproduce qualitatively the spatial kinematics of the HC$_3$N J=5--4 emission using a HC$_3$N shell with two pairs of cavities cleared by the collimated high velocity outflows along the polar direction and in the equatorial plane. We infer a relatively high abundance of HC$_3$N/H$_2$ $\sim$3x10$^{-6}$ for an estimated mass--loss rate of 3x10$^{-5}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ in the HC$_3$N shell. The high abundance of HC$_3$N and the presence of some weaker J=5--4 emission in the vicinity of the central post-AGB star suggest an unusually efficient formation of this molecule in the Egg nebula.",Astronomy
2301,831.0,"synthesis of the many separate times a community has stated its sentiments on a given issue. Thus the norm has a history much like that of an article of common law: it is an accumulation of decisions made by the community over a long period of time which gradually gathers enough moral influence to serve as a precedent for future decisions. Like an article of common law, the norm retains its validity only if it is regularly used as a basis for judgment. Each time the community censures some act of deviance, then, it sharpens the authority of the violated norm and re-establishes the boundaries of the group. One of the most interesting features of control institutions, in this regard, is the amount of publicity they have always attracted. In an earlier day, correction of deviant offenders took place in the public market and gave the crowd a chance to display its interest in a direct, active way. In our own day, the guilty are no longer paraded in public places, but instead we are confronted by a heavy flow of newspaper and radio reports which offer much the same kind of entertainment. Why are these reports considered ""newsworthy"" and why do they rate the extraordinary attention they receiv ? Perhaps they satisfy a number of psychological perversities among the mass audience, as many commentators have suggested, but at the same time they constitute our main source of information about the normative outlines of society. They are lessons through which we teach one another what the norms mean and how far they extend. In a figurative sense, at least, morality and immorality meet at the public scaffold, and it is during this meeting that the community declares where the line between them should be drawn. Human groups need to regulate the routine affairs of everyday life, and to this end the norms provide an important focus for behavior. But human groups also need to describe and ancipate those areas of being which lie beyond the immediate borders of the group-the unseen dangers which in any culture and in any age seem to threaten the security of group life. The universal folklore depicting demons, devils, witches and evil spirits may be one way to give form to these otherwise formless dangers, but the visible deviant is another kind of reminder. As a trespasser against the norm, he represents those forces excluded by the group's boundaries: he informs us, as it were, what evil looks like, what shapes the devil can assume. In doing so, he shows us the difference between kinds of experience which belong within the group and kinds of experience which belong outside it. Thus deviance cannot be dismissed as behavior which disrupts stability in society, but is itself, in controlled quantities, an important condition for preserving stability.",Sociology

EMA aims to minimize recall bias, maximize ecological validity, and allow study of microprocesses that influence behavior in real-world contexts. EMA studies assess particular events in subjects' lives or assess subjects at periodic intervals, often by random time sampling, using technologies ranging from written diaries and telephones to electronic diaries and physiological sensors.

After a brief outline of Bourdieu's reasoning in Masculine Domination and of the controversy surrounding this essay, I discuss the concept of habitus, which forms the theoretical core of Masculine Domination, in the broader context of Bourdieu's work. Habitus is an analytical tool that overcomes the discipline's theoretical barriers to the integration of the category of gender on a central point: the concept of the social agent. I will demonstrate this by opposing the concept of habitus to the construct of the social role that, up to this day, is most influential in shaping the sociological understanding of the social agent.",Sociology

2308,959.0,"Much empirical work in the social-movements literature has focused on the role of social ties in movement recruitment. Yet these studies have been plagued by a troubling theoretical and empirical imprecision. This imprecision stems from three sources. First, these studies are generally silent on the basic sociological dynamics that account for the reported findings. Second, movement scholars have generally failed to specify and test the precise dimensions of social ties that seem to account for their effects. Finally, most studies fail to acknowledge that individuals are embedded in many relationships that may expose the individual to conflicting pressures.

Historically, psychological factors have been neglected by researchers and health authorities despite evidence that pandemics are, to a large extent, psychological phenomena whereby beliefs and behaviors influence the spreading versus containment of infection. Psychological factors are important in determining (a) adherence to pandemic mitigation methods (e.g., adherence to social distancing), (b) pandemic-related social disruption (e.g., panic buying, racism, antilockdown protests), and (c) pandemic-related distress and related problems (e.g., anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, prolonged grief disorder). The psychology of pandemics has emerged as an important field of research and practice during the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. As a scholarly discipline, the psychology of pandemics is fragmented and diverse, encompassing various psychological subspecialties and allied disciplines, but is vital for shaping clinical practice and public health guidelines for COVID-19 and future pandemics.

We present a preliminary report on our attempts to detect a magnetic field in this star with high-resolution measurements obtained with the spectropolarimeter Narval at TBL, France during 2 observing runs of 5 nights in 2006 and 5 nights in 2007. Only upper limits could be obtained, even with the longest possible exposure times. If the star hosts a magnetic field, its surface strength should be less than about 300 G.

2317,153.0,"We study global non-axisymmetric oscillation modes trapped near the inner boundary of an accretion disc. Observations indicate that some of the quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) observed in the luminosities of accreting compact objects (neutron stars, black holes and white dwarfs) are produced in the inner-most regions of accretion discs or boundary layers. Two simple models are considered in this paper: The magnetosphere-disc model consists of a thin Keplerian disc in contact with a uniformly rotating magnetosphere with and low plasma density, while the star-disc model involves a Keplerian disc terminated at the stellar atomosphere with high density and small density scale height. We find that the interface modes at the magnetosphere-disc boundary are generally unstable due to Rayleigh-Taylor and/or Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities. However, differential rotation of the disc tends to suppress Rayleigh-Taylor instability and a sufficiently high disc sound speed (or temperature) is needed to overcome this suppression and to attain net mode growth. On the other hand, Kelvin-Helmholtz instability may be active at low disc sound speeds. We also find that the interface modes trapped at the boundary between a thin disc and an unmagnetized star do not suffer Rayleigh-Taylor or Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, but can become unstable due to wave leakage to large disc radii and, for sufficiently steep disc density distributions, due to wave absorption at the corotation resonance in the disc. The non-axisymmetric interface modes studied in this paper may be relevant to the high-frequency QPOs observed in some X-ray binaries and in cataclysmic variables.",Astronomy
2318,780.0,"This is a study of social mobility within the developing class structures of modern industrial societies based on a unique data-set constructed by John Goldthorpe and Robert Erikson. The focus is on the experience of European nations - western and eastern - in the period of the `long boom' following the Second World War; but the book also devotes separate chapters to examining the experience of the USA, Australia, and Japan. The authors combine historical and statistical approaches in their analysis of both trends in mobility and of cross-national similarities and differences. They show that wide variation at the level of actually observed mobility coexists with a surprising degree of constancy and commonality in underlying patterns of social fluidity. The empirical results of their study serve as the basis for a critical re-examination of current theories of mobility and for raising more general issues of the proper concerns and methods of comparative macro-sociology.

The superhump period decreased when the superhump amplitude reached to the first maximum, successively gradually increased until the second maximum of the amplitude, and finally decreased again. Investigating other SU UMa-type dwarf novae which show an increase of the superhump period, we found the same trend of the superhump evolution in superoutbursts of them. We speculate that the superhump regrowth in the amplitude has a close relation to the increase of the superhump period, and all of SU UMa-type dwarf novae with a superhump regrowth follow the same evolution of the ordinary superhumps as that of ASAS 160048-4846.2.",Astronomy

The utility of this approach is demonstrated by using it to explain the recent precipitous rise in autism diagnoses.

While much of this work is atheoretical, the focus on attitudes suggests that researchers are implicitly drawing upon attitude theory in psychology. The present research brings sociological theory to environmental sociology by drawing on identity theory to understand environmentally responsive behavior. We develop an environment identity model of environmental behavior that includes not only the meanings of the environment identity, but also the prominence and salience of the environment identity and commitment to the environment identity. We examine the identity process as it relates to behavior, though not to the exclusion of examining the effects of environmental attitudes. The findings reveal that individual agency is important in influencing environmentally responsive behavior, but this agency is largely through identity processes, rather than attitude processes. This provides an important theoretical and empirical advance over earlier work in environmental sociology.",Sociology
2327,9.0,"The association of an electromagnetic signal with the merger of a pair of supermassive black holes would have many important implications. For example, it would provide new information about gas and magnetic field interactions in dynamical spacetimes as well as a combination of redshift and luminosity distance that would enable precise cosmological tests. A proposal first made by Bode &amp; Phinney (2007) is that because radiation of gravitational waves during the final inspiral and merger of the holes is abrupt and decreases the mass of the central object by a few percent, there will be waves in the disk that can steepen into shocks and thus increase the disk luminosity in a characteristic way. We evaluate this process analytically and numerically. We find that shocks only occur when the fractional mass loss exceeds the half-thickness (h/r) of the disk, hence significant energy release only occurs for geometrically thin disks which are thus at low Eddington ratios. This strongly limits the effective energy release, and in fact our simulations show that the natural variations in disk luminosity are likely to obscure this effect entirely. However, we demonstrate that the reduction of luminosity caused by the retreat of the inner edge of the disk following mass loss is potentially detectable. This decrease occurs even if the disk is geometrically thick, and lasts for a duration on the order of the viscous time of the modified disk. Observationally, the best prospect for detection would be a sensitive future X-ray instrument with a field of view of on the order of a square degree, or possibly a wide-field radio array such as the Square Kilometer Array, if the disk changes produce or interrupt radio emission from a jet.",Astronomy
2328,862.0,"Sociology was born as an attempt to delimit an object of investigation offered by society as a social reality. The ambition was that of “treating the social facts as things” (Durkheim) or of understanding and explaining the social relations by respecting an “axiological neutrality” (Max Weber). Today, however, we are in the presence of a new kind of sociologists, and they are by no means the less popular ones, who are not trying to avoid assessments in their analysis of the present social world. I have in mind especially two sociologists, Ulrich Beck (Munich) and David Held (London). I will discuss in particular the view of sociology presented in a recent book of Ulrich Beck (Macht und Gegenmacht im globalen Zeitalter, 2002, translated into French under the title Pouvoir et contre-pouvoir a l’ere de la mondialisation, 2003), and I will show some analogies between Beck and Held.

The rapid expansion of environmental psychology can be gauged by the diversity and sheer quantity of publications that have appeared since Kenneth Craik’s 1973 review of this area in the present series (92). During the past 5 years (from early 1972 through early 1977), no fewer than ten text books (13, 72, 151,194, 214, 271,306, 307a, 344, 372) and six edited readers (160, 210, 320, 352, 360, 400) were published, all of which pertain to the interface between human behavior and the sociophysical environment. In addition, two multiple volume series designed to communicate significant theoretical and methodological dvances in the field (15, 16, 41) were established, while more than 30 ""state of the art"" monographs and edited volumes on specific topics within the environment-and-behavior area appeared (5, 18, 33, 39, 42, 82, 89, 96, 102, 115, 116, 135, 157, 172, 176, 179, 212, 259, 264, 276, 304, 305, 307, 315, 318, 324, 388, 389, 408, 415, 426, 433, 443, 453, 490, 494).

I conclude by suggesting some ways in which this area could be expanded and developed further. I suggest that sociological analyses of how individuals experience, understand and manage their mouth and oral health, can add to and enhance the broader field of the sociology of health and illness.

2335,562.0,"Most current models in health psychology assume that stress adversely affects physical health. We re-examined this assumption by reviewing extensive data from the literature and from six samples of our own, in which we collected measures of personality, health and fitness, stress, and current emotional functioning. Results indicate that self-report health measures reflect a pervasive mood disposition of negative affectivity (NA); self-report stress scales also contain a substantial NA component. However, although NA is correlated with health compliant scales, it is not strongly or consistently related to actual, long-term health status, and thus will act as a general nuisance factor in health research. Because self-report measures of stress and health both contain a significant NA component, correlations between such measures likely overestimate the true association between stress and health. Results demonstrate the importance of including different types of health measures in health psychology research.",Psychology

The sample is composed of 56 bursts, corresponding to a rate of ~ 0.8 GRB per month. Thanks to the performances of the INTEGRAL Burst Alert System, 50% of the IBIS GRBs have detected afterglows, while 5% have redshift measurements. A spectral analysis of the 43 bursts in the INTEGRAL public archive has been carried out using the most recent software and calibration, deriving an updated, homogeneous and accurate catalogue with the spectral features of the sample. When possible also a time-resolved spectral analysis has been carried out. The GRBs in the sample have 20-200 keV fluences in the range 5 x 1E-8 --2.5 x 1E-4 erg cm-2, and peak fluxes in the range 0.11 - 56 ph cm-2 s-1. While most of the spectra are well fitted by a power law with photon index ~ 1.6, we found that 9 bursts are better described by a cut-off power law, resulting in Ep values in the range 35--190 keV. Altough these results are comparable with those obtained with BAT onboard Swift, there is a marginal evidence that ISGRI detects dimmer bursts than Swift/BAT. Using the revised spectral parameters and an updated sky exposure map that takes into account also the effects of the GRB trigger efficiency, we strengthen the evidence for a spatial correlation with the super galactic plane of the faint bursts with long spectral lag (Foley et al.,2008).",Astronomy

In European cities, by contrast, the spread of districts of 'exclusion' does not herald the formation of ghettos.

2348,133.0,"Over the last decade, X-ray observations unveiled the existence of several classes of isolated neutron stars (INSs) which are radio-quiet or exhibit radio emission with properties much at variance with those of ordinary radio pulsars. The identification of new sources is crucial in order to understand the relations among the different classes and to compare observational constraints with theoretical expectations. A recent analysis of the 2XMMp catalogue provided less than 30 new thermally emitting INS candidates. Among these, the source 2XMM J104608.7-594306 appears particularly interesting because of the softness of its X-ray spectrum and of the present upper limits in the optical, which imply a logarithmic X-ray-to-optical flux ratio greater than 3.1, corrected for absorption. We present the X-ray and optical properties of 2XMM J104608.7-594306 and discuss its nature in the light of two possible scenarios invoked to explain the X-ray thermal emission from INSs: the release of residual heat in a cooling neutron star, as in the seven radio-quiet ROSAT-discovered INSs, and accretion from the interstellar medium. We find that the present observational picture of 2XMM J104608.7-594306 is consistent with a distant cooling INS with properties in agreement with the most up-to-date expectations of population synthesis models: it is fainter, hotter and more absorbed than the seven ROSAT sources and possibly located in the Carina Nebula, a region likely to harbour unidentified cooling neutron stars.

We review all the primordial non-Gaussian models in the present literature and calculate the CMB bispectrum up to l &lt;2000 for each different model. This allows us to determine the observational independence of these models by calculating the cross-correlation of their CMB bispectra. We are able to identify several distinct classes of primordial shapes - including equilateral, local, warm, flat and feature (non-scale invariant) - which should be distinguishable given a significant detection of CMB non-Gaussianity. We demonstrate that a simple shape correlator provides a fast and reliable method for determining whether or not CMB shapes are well correlated. We use an eigenmode decomposition of the primordial shape to characterise and understand model independence. Finally, we advocate a standardised normalisation method for $f_{NL}$ based on the shape autocorrelator, so that observational limits and errors can be consistently compared for different models.",Astronomy

2351,351.0,"This paper explores the power of personality traits both as predictors and as causes of academic and economic success, health, and criminal activity. Measured personality is interpreted as a construct derived from an economic model of preferences, constraints, and information. Evidence is reviewed about the ""situational specificity"" of personality traits and preferences. An extreme version of the situationist view claims that there are no stable personality traits or preference parameters that persons carry across different situations. Those who hold this view claim that personality psychology has little relevance for economics. The biological and evolutionary origins of personality traits are explored. Personality measurement systems and relationships among the measures used by psychologists are examined. The predictive power of personality measures is compared with the predictive power of measures of cognition captured by IQ and achievement tests. For many outcomes, personality measures are just as predictive as cognitive measures, even after controlling for family background and cognition. Moreover, standard measures of cognition are heavily influenced by personality traits and incentives. Measured personality traits are positively correlated over the life cycle. However, they are not fixed and can be altered by experience and investment. Intervention studies, along with studies in biology and neuroscience, establish a causal basis for the observed effect of personality traits on economic and social outcomes. Personality traits are more malleable over the life cycle compared to cognition, which becomes highly rank stable around age 10. Interventions that change personality are promising avenues for addressing poverty and disadvantage.",Psychology

2356,668.0,"■ Abstract Sociologists often model social processes as interactions among variables. We review an alternative approach that models social life as interactions among adaptive agents who influence one another in response to the influence they receive. These agent-based models (ABMs) show how simple and predictable local interactions can generate familiar but enigmatic global patterns, such as the diffusion of information, emergence of norms, coordination of conventions, or participation in collective action. Emergent social patterns can also appear unexpectedly and then just as dramatically transform or disappear, as happens in revolutions, market crashes, fads, and feeding frenzies. ABMs provide theoretical leverage where the global patterns of interest are more than the aggregation of individual attributes, but at the same time, the emergent pattern cannot be understood without a bottom up dynamical model of the microfoundations at the relational level. We begin with a brief historical sketch of the shift from “factors” to “actors” in computational sociology that shows how agent-based modeling differs fundamentally from earlier sociological uses of computer simulation. We then review recent contributions focused on the emergence of social structure and social order out of local interaction. Although sociology has lagged behind other social sciences in appreciating this new methodology, a distinctive sociological contribution is evident in the papers we review. First, theoretical interest focuses on dynamic social networks that shape and are shaped by agent interaction. Second, ABMs are used to perform virtual experiments that test macrosociological theories by manipulating structural factors like network topology, social stratification, or spatial mobility. We conclude our review with a series of recommendations for realizing the rich sociological potential of this approach.",Sociology
2357,247.0,"We investigate shattering and coagulation of dust grains in turbulent interstellar medium (ISM). The typical velocity of dust grain as a function of grain size has been calculated for various ISM phases based on a theory of grain dynamics in compressible magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. In this paper, we develop a scheme of grain shattering and coagulation and apply it to turbulent ISM by using the grain velocities predicted by the above turbulence theory. Since large grains tend to acquire large velocity dispersions as shown by earlier studies, large grains tend to be shattered. Large shattering effects are indeed seen in warm ionized medium (WIM) within a few Myr for grains with radius $a\ga 10^{-6}$ cm. We also show that shattering in warm neutral medium (WNM) can limit the largest grain size in ISM ($a\sim 2\times 10^{-5} \mathrm{cm}$). On the other hand, coagulation tends to modify small grains since it only occurs when the grain velocity is small enough. Coagulation significantly modifies the grain size distribution in dense clouds (DC), where a large fraction of the grains with $a&lt;10^{-6}$ cm coagulate in 10 Myr. In fact, the correlation among $R_V$, the carbon bump strength, and the ultraviolet slope in the observed Milky Way extinction curves can be explained by the coagulation in DC. It is possible that the grain size distribution in the Milky Way is determined by a combination of all the above effects of shattering and coagulation. Considering that shattering and coagulation in turbulence are effective if dust-to-gas ratio is typically more than $\sim 1/10$ of the Galactic value, the regulation mechanism of grain size distribution should be different between metal-poor and metal-rich environments.",Astronomy
2358,52.0,"A new solar burst emission spectral component has been found showing sub-THz fluxes increasing with frequency, spectrally separated from the well known microwave component. Rapid pulsations are found present in all events observed at the two frequencies of the solar submillimeter-wave telescope (SST): 212 and 405 GHz. They were studied in greater detail for three solar bursts exhibiting the new THz spectral component. The pulse amplitudes are of about 5-8% of the mean flux throughout the bursts durations, being comparable for both frequencies. Pulsations range from one pulse every few seconds to 8-10 per second. The pulse repetition rates (R) are linearly proportional to the mean burst fluxes (S), following the simple relationship S = k R, suggesting that the pulsations might be the response to discrete flare particle accelerator injections quantized in energy. Although this result is consistent with qualitative trends previously found in the GHz range, the pulse amplitude relative to the mean fluxes at the sub-THz frequencies appear to be nearly ten times smaller than expected from the extrapolation of the trends found in the GHz range. However there are difficulties to reconcile the nearly simultaneous GHz and THz burst emission spectrally separated components, exhibiting rapid pulsations with considerably larger relative intensities in the GHz range.",Astronomy

2361,80.0,"We study the possibility that minor mergers resolve the loss cone depletion problem, which is the difficulty occured in the coalescence process of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) binary, by performing numerical simulations with a highly accurate $N$-body code. We show that the minor merger of a dwarf galaxy disturbs stellar orbits in the galactic central region of the host galaxy where the loss cone depletion is already caused by the SMBH binary. The disturbed stars are supplied into the loss cone. Stars of the dwarf galaxy are also supplied into the loss cone. The gravitational interactions between the SMBH binary and these stars become very effective. The gravitational interaction decreases the binding energy of the SMBH binary effectively. As a result, the shrink of the separation of the SMBH binary is accelerated. Our numerical results strongly suggest that the minor mergers are one of the important processes to reduce the coalescence time of the SMBH binary much less than the Hubble time.",Astronomy
2362,75.0,"Our work focuses on a comprehensive orbital phase dependent spectroscopy of the four High Mass X-ray Binary Pulsars (HMXBPs) 4U 1538-52, GX 301-2, OAO 1657-415 &amp; Vela X-1. We hereby report the measurements of the variation of the absorption column density and iron-line flux along with other spectral parameters over the binary orbit for the above-mentioned HMXBPs in elliptical orbits, as observed with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) and the BeppoSAX satellites. A spherically symmetric wind profile was used as a model to compare the observed column density variations. Out of the four pulsars, only in 4U 1538-52, we find the model having a reasonable corroboration with the observations, whereas in the remaining three the stellar wind seems to be clumpy and a smooth symmetric stellar wind model appears to be quite inadequate in explaining the data. Moreover, in GX 301-2, neither the presence of a disk nor a gas stream from the companion was validated. Furthermore, the spectral results obtained in the case of OAO 1657-415 &amp; Vela X-1 were more or less similar to that of GX 301-2.",Astronomy

2364,869.0,"This is an introduction to sociology, suitable for students encountering the subject for the first time. Sociology is the study of human beings as individuals and the society we live in. It tackles issues which form the centre of our lives, such as the family, education and employment. Learning more about sociology can help us understand the social forces which constrain us, and empowers us to take control of our own lives. This title covers the theories and methods of sociology and the social divisions, including class, gender, race, age and ability. It also deals with the changing nature of the family, the media and its influence, power and politics, and crime and devience. It addresses the subjects of work, unemployment and leisure, the education system and the welfare state, including poverty and health.",Sociology
2365,654.0,"Theorization in the sociology of migration and the field of refugee studies has been retarded by a path-dependent division that we argue should be broken down by greater mutual engagement. Excavating the construction of the refugee category reveals how unwarranted assumptions shape contemporary disputes about the scale of refugee crises, appropriate policy responses, and suitable research tools. Empirical studies of how violence interacts with economic and other factors shaping mobility offer lessons for both fields. Adapting existing theories that may not appear immediately applicable, such as household economy approaches, helps explain refugees’ decision-making processes. At a macro level, world systems theory sheds light on the interactive policies around refugees across states of origin, mass hosting, asylum, transit, and resettlement. Finally, focusing on the integration of refugees in the Global South reveals a pattern that poses major challenges to theories of assimilation and citizenship developed in settler states of the Global North.",Sociology
2366,958.0,"Upon what kind of moral order does capitalism rest? Conversely, does the market give rise to a distinctive set of beliefs, habits, and social bonds? These questions are certainly as old as social science itself. In this review, we evaluate how today’s scholarship approaches the relationship between markets and the moral order. We begin with Hirschman’s characterization of the three rival views of the market as civilizing, destructive, or feeble in its effects on society. We review recent work at the intersection of sociology, economics, and political economy and show that these views persist both as theories of market society and moral arguments about it. We then argue that a fourth view, which we call moralized markets, has become increasingly prominent in economic sociology. This line of research sees markets as cultural phenomena and moral projects in their own right, and seeks to study the mechanisms and techniques by which such projects are realized in practice.",Sociology
2367,556.0,"It is commonly assumed that people make intertemporal choices by ""discounting"" the value of delayed outcomes, assigning discounted values independently to all options, and comparing the discounted values. We identify a class of anomalies to this assumption of alternative-based discounting, which collectively shows that options are not treated independently but rather comparatively: The time difference, or interval, between the options sometimes counts more and sometimes counts less if it is taken as a whole than if it is divided into shorter subintervals (superadditivity and subadditivity, respectively), and whether the interval counts more or less depends on the money difference, or compensation, involved (inseparability). We develop a model that replaces alternative-based discounting with attribute-based tradeoffs. In our model, people make intertemporal choices by weighing how much more they will receive or pay if they wait longer against how much longer the wait will be, or, conversely, how much less they will receive or pay if they do not wait longer against how much shorter the wait will be. This model, called the tradeoff model, accommodates, in a psychologically plausible way, all anomalies that the discounting approach can and cannot address.",Psychology

What has psychology contributed, for example, to our understanding of the various human virtues? Regrettably, not much. The last decade, however, has witnessed a growing movement to abandon the exclusive focus on the negative. Psychologists from several subdisciplines are now asking an intriguing question: ""What strengths does a person employ to deal effectively with life?""

In its pages, readers are treated to an analysis of what the foremost experts believe to be the fundamental strengths of humankind. Both seasoned professionals and students just entering the field are eager to grasp the power and vitality of the human spirit as it faces a multitude of life challenges.

2370,342.0,"Life-span developmental psychology involves the study of constancy and change in behavior throughout the life course. One aspect of life-span research has been the advancement of a more general, metatheoretical view on the nature of development. The family of theoretical perspectives associated with this metatheoretical view of life-span developmental psychology includes the recognition of multidirectionality in ontogenetic change, consideration of both age-connected and disconnected developmental factors, a focus on the dynamic and continuous interplay between growth (gain) and decline (loss), emphasis on historical embeddedness and other structural contextual factors, and the study of the range of plasticity in development. Application of the family of perspectives associated with life-span developmental psychology is illustrated for the domain of intellectual development. Two recently emerging perspectives of the family of beliefs are given particular attention. The first proposition is methodological and suggests that plasticity can best be studied with a research strategy called testing-the-limits. The second proposition is theoretical and proffers that any developmental change includes the joint occurrence of gain (growth) and loss (decline) in adaptive capacity. To assess the pattern of positive (gains) and negative (losses) consequences resulting from development, it is necessary to know the criterion demands posed by the individual and the environment during the lifelong process of adaptation. The study of life-span development is not a homogeneous field. It comes in two major interrelated modes. The first mode is the extension of developmental studies across the life course without a major effort at the construction of metatheory that emanates from life-span work. The second mode includes the endeavor to explore whether life-span research has specific implications for the general nature of developmental theory. The second approach represents the topic of this article. Specifically, the purpose of this article is twofold. First, after a brief introduction to the field of life-span developmental psychology, some ""prototypical"" features of the life-span approach in developmental psychology are presented. Second, these features are illustrated by work in one domain: intellectual development. Although the focus of this paper is on life-span developmental psychology and its theoretical thrust, it is important to recognize at the outset that similar perspectives on developmental theory have been advanced in other quarters of developmental scholarship as well (Hetherington & Baltes, in press; Scan; 1986). There is, however, a major difference in the ""gestalt"" in which the features of the theoretical perspective of life-span psychology are organized.",Psychology

We explicitly construct an example of the inflaton potential governing the motion of a mobile D3 brane in the entire warped deformed conifold. This allows us to precisely identify the corresponding scales of the cosmic microwave background. The effects due to bulk fluxes or localized sources are parametrized using gauge/string duality. We next perform some sample scannings to explore the parameter space of the complete potential, and first demonstrate that without the bulk effects there can be large degenerate sets of parameters with observationally consistent predictions. When the bulk perturbations are included, however, the observational predictions are generally spoiled. For them to remain consistent, the magnitudes of the bulk effects need to be highly suppressed via fine tuning.",Astronomy
2373,173.0,"We explore the observational characteristics of jet-driven supernovae by simulating bipolar-jet-driven explosions in a red supergiant progenitor. We present results of four models in which we hold the injected kinetic energy at a constant $10^{51}$ ergs across all jet models but vary the specific characteristics of the jets to explore the influence of the nature of jets on the structure of the supernova ejecta. We evolve the explosions past shock-breakout and into quasi-homologous expansion of the supernova envelope into a red supergiant wind. The oppositely-directed, nickel-rich jets give a large-scale asymmetry that may account for the non-spherical excitation and substructure of spectral lines such as H$\alpha$ and He I 10830\AA. Jets with a large fraction of kinetic to thermal energy punch through the progenitor envelope and give rise to explosions that would be observed to be asymmetric from the earliest epochs, inconsistent with spectropolarimetric measurements of Type II supernovae. Jets with higher thermal energy fractions result in explosions that are roughly spherical at large radii but are significantly elongated at smaller radii, deep inside the ejecta, in agreement with the polarimetric observations. We present shock breakout light curves that indicate that strongly aspherical shock breakouts are incompatible with recent {\it GALEX} observations of shock breakout from red supergiant stars. Comparison with observations indicates that jets must deposit their kinetic energy efficiently throughout the ejecta while in the hydrogen envelope. Thermal energy-dominated jets satisfy this criterion and yield many of the observational characteristics of Type II supernovae.",Astronomy

2378,235.0,"Measurements of Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations in galaxy surveys have been recognized as a powerful tool for constraining dark energy. However, this method relies on the knowledge of the size of the acoustic horizon at recombination derived from Cosmic Microwave Background Anisotropy measurements. This estimate is typically derived assuming a standard recombination scheme; additional radiation sources can delay recombination altering the cosmic ionization history and the cosmological inferences drawn from CMB and BAO data. In this paper we quantify the effect of delayed recombination on the determination of dark energy parameters from future BAO surveys such as BOSS and WFMOS. We find the impact to be small but still not negligible. In particular, if recombination is non-standard (to a level still allowed by CMB data), but this is ignored, future surveys may incorrectly suggest the presence of a redshift dependent dark energy component. On the other hand, in the case of delayed recombination, adding to the analysis one extra parameter describing deviations from standard recombination, does not significantly degrade the error-bars on dark energy parameters and yields unbiased estimates.",Astronomy
2379,74.0,"The two-component, core-crust, model of a neutron star with homogenous internal and dipolar external magnetic field is studied responding to quake-induced perturbation by substantially nodeless differentially rotational Alfv\'en oscillations of the perfectly conducting crustal matter about axis of fossil magnetic field frozen in the immobile core. The energy variational method of the magneto-solid-mechanical theory of a viscoelastic perfectly conducting medium pervaded by magnetic field is utilized to compute the frequency and lifetime of nodeless torsional vibrations of crustal solid-state plasma about the dipole magnetic-moment axis of the star. It is found that obtained two-parametric spectral formula for the frequency of this toroidal Alfven mode provides fairly accurate account of rapid oscillations of the X-ray flux during the flare of SGR 1806-20 and SGR 1900+14, supporting the investigated conjecture that these quasi-periodic oscillations owe its origin to axisymmetric torsional oscillations predominately driven by Lorentz force of magnetic field stresses in the finite-depth crustal region of the above magnetars.",Astronomy

Often the latter kind of student had high school grades and high standardized test scores. What appeared to underlie the differences in these two groups of students was the differences in the way they approached learning of subject matter. Unfortunately, as a graduate student at the University of Minnesota in the 1950’s, the only learning psychology taught was behavioral psychology, and this largely sought to remove meaning from learning experiments, either by using animals, nonsense syllables, paired-word associations, or other material that would not “contaminate” experiments due to the almost idiosyncratic nature of leaner’s meanings of concepts or ideas. I thought then that behavioral psychology had essentially no relevance to human learning of the kind I was interested in.

2388,77.0,"The constraint on the total energy in a given spatial region is given from holography by the mass of a black hole which just fits in that region, which leads to an UV/IR relation: the maximal energy density in that region is proportional to $M_p^2/L^2$, where $M_p$ is the Planck mass and $L$ is the spatial scale of that region under consideration. Assuming the maximal black hole in the universe is formed through gravitational collapse of perturbations in the universe, then the ""Jeans"" scale of the perturbations gives a causal connection scale $R_{\rm CC}$. For gravitational perturbations, $R^{-2}_{\rm CC}={\rm Max}(\dot H+2H^2, -\dot H)$ for a flat universe. We study the cosmological dynamics of the corresponding vacuum energy density by choosing the causal connection scale as the IR cutoff in the UV/IR relation, in the cases of the vacuum energy density as an independently conserved energy component and an effective dynamical cosmological constant, respectively. It turns out that only the case with the choice $R_{\rm CC}^{-2}= \dot H +2H^2$, could be consistent with the current cosmological observations when the vacuum density appears as an independently conserved energy component. In this case, the model is called holographic Ricci scalar dark energy model in the literature.",Astronomy

For b&lt;0 rotating black holes with dimensionless spin a&gt;1 are allowed. We investigate the role of the tidal charge b in the orbital resonance model of QPOs in black hole systems. The orbital Keplerian, the radial and vertical epicyclic frequencies of the equatorial, quasicircular geodetical motion are given and their radial profiles are discussed. The resonant conditions are given in three astrophysically relevant situations: for direct (parametric) resonances, for the relativistic precession model, and for some trapped oscillations of the warped discs, with resonant combinational frequencies. It is shown, how b could influence matching of the observational data indicating the 3:2 frequency ratio observed in GRS 1915+105 microquasar with prediction of the orbital resonance model; limits on allowed range of the black hole parameters a and b are established. The ""magic"" dimensionless black hole spin enabling presence of strong resonant phenomena at the radius where \nu_K:\nu_{\theta}:\nu_r=3:2:1 is determined in dependence on b. Such strong resonances could be relevant even in sources with highly scattered resonant frequencies, as those expected in Sgr A*. The specific values of a and b are given also for existence of specific radius where \nu_K:\nu_{\theta}:\nu_r=s:t:u with 5&gt;=s&gt;t&gt;u being small natural numbers.

We compare our results with the soft X-ray diffuse background (SXRB) emission detected in front of 378 identified shadowing regions during the ROSAT All-Sky Survey (Snowden et al. 2000). This foreground component is principally attributed to the hot gas of the so-called Local Bubble (LB), an irregularly shaped cavity of ~50-150 pc around the Sun, which is supposed to contain ~10^6 K plasma. Our results suggest that the SWCX emission from the heliosphere is bright enough to account for most of the foreground emission towards the majority of low galactic latitude directions, where the LB is the least extended. In a large part of directions with galactic latitude above 30deg the heliospheric SWCX intensity is significantly smaller than the measured one. However, the SWCX R2/R1 band ratio differs slightly from the data in the galactic center direction, and more significantly in the galactic anti-centre direction where the observed ratio is the smallest. Assuming that both SWCX and hot gas emission are present and their relative contributions vary with direction, we tested a series of thermal plasma spectra for temperatures ranging from 10^5 to 10^6.5 K and searched for a combination of SWCX spectra and thermal emission matching the observed intensities and band ratios, while simultaneously being compatible with O VI emission measurements. In the frame of collisional equilibrium models and for solar abundances, the range we derive for hot gas temperature and emission measure cannot reproduce the Wisconsin C/B band ratio. We emphasize the need for additional atomic data, describing consistently EUV and X-ray photon spectra of the charge-exchange emission of heavier solar wind ions.",Astronomy
2393,973.0,"This collection of essays, written by Dorothy Smith over the past eight years, is a long-awaited treasure by one of the world's foremost social thinkers. In it, Smith turns her wit and common sense on the prevailing discourses of sociology, political economy, philosophy, and popular culture, at the same time developing her own sociological and feminist practice in unexpected and remarkable directions. Shedding the idiom of the sociologist, Smith inquires directly into the actualities of peoples' lives. Her critical investigations of postmodernism, political correctness, university politics, and SNAF (the Standard North American Family) draw on metaphors and examples from a stimulating range of autobiographical, theoretical, historical, political, and humorous resources. Out of an abstract encounter with Bakhtin, for example, comes an analysis of a child learning to name a bird, and a new way of seeing the story of Helen Keller. In introducing a radically innovative approach to the sociology of discourse, even the most difficult points are addressed through ordinary scenes of mothers, cats, and birds, as well as scientists, pulsars, and cell microscopes. Smith's engaged, rebel sociology throws light on a remarkable range of issues and authors, forever changing the way the reader experiences the world. This, her signature work, will delight a wide and varied audience, and enliven university courses for years to come.",Sociology
2394,278.0,"We explore the relationship between the hard X-ray photon index $\Gamma$ and the Eddington ratio (\xi=L_{X}(0.5-25 keV)/L_{Edd}) in six XRBs. We find that different XRBs follow different anti-correlations between $\Gamma$ and $\xi$ when $\xi$ is less than a critical value, while they follow the same positive correlation when $\xi$ is larger than the critical value. This anti-correlation and positive correlation are also found in LLAGNs and QSOs respectively, and the anti-correlation and positive correlation of different XRBs roughly converge to the same point ($\log \xi=-2.1, \Gamma=1.5$), which may correspond to the accretion mode transition, since that the anti-correlation and positive correlation are consistent with the prediction of ADAFs and standard disk/corona system respectively. The traditional low/hard state are divided into two parts by the cross point $\log \xi\sim-2.1$, i.e., faint-hard state in the anti-correlation part and bright-hard state in the positive correlation part. The accretion process in the bright-hard state may be still the standard accretion disk as that in the high/soft state, which is consistent with that both the cold disk component and broad Fe K emission line are observed in some bright-hard state of XRBs. The ADAF is only important in the faint-hard state XRBs. Motivated by the similarities of the state transition and timing properties of the ULXs to that of XRBs, we then constrain the BH masses for seven luminous ULXs assuming that their X-ray spectral evolution is similar to that of XRBs. We find that the BH masses of these seven ULXs are around $10^{4}M_sun$, which are typical intermediate mass BHs (IMBHs). Our results are roughly consistent with the BH masses constrained from the model fitting with a multi-color disk and/or the timing properties(e.g., QPO and break frequency).",Astronomy

With COVID-19 presenting as a global pandemic, there is much speculation about the implications of this crisis for the future of work and for people working in organizations. In this article, we discuss 10 of the most relevant research and practice topics in the field of industrial and organizational psychology that will likely be strongly influenced by COVID-19. For each of these topics, the pandemic crisis is creating new work-related challenges, but it is also presenting various opportunities. The topics discussed herein include occupational health and safety, work–family issues, telecommuting, virtual teamwork, job insecurity, precarious work, leadership, human resources policy, the aging workforce, and careers. This article sets the stage for further discussion of various ways in which I-O psychology research and practice can address the issues that COVID-19 creates for work and organizational processes that are affecting workers now and will shape the future of work and organizations in both the short and long term.

With a focus on content, structure, and process, identity is defined as ideology cognized through the individual engagement with discourse, made manifest in a personal narrative constructed and reconstructed across the life course, and scripted in and through social interaction and social practice. This approach to the study of identity challenges personality and social psychologists to consider a cultural psychology framework that focuses on the relationship between master narratives and personal narratives of identity, recognizes the value of a developmental perspective, and uses ethnographic and idiographic methods. Research in personality and social psychology that either explicitly or implicitly relies on the model is reviewed.",Psychology
2400,691.0,"Abstract Developing an agenda for the social study of ignorance, this paper introduces the sociology of strategic unknowns: the investigation of the multifaceted ways that ignorance can be harnessed as a resource, enabling knowledge to be deflected, obscured, concealed or magnified in a way that increases the scope of what remains unintelligible. In contrast to theoretical preoccupations that underlie the study of knowledge accumulation, a focus on the importance of strategic unknowns resists the tendency to value knowledge over ignorance or to assume that the procurement of more knowledge is linked in an automatic or a linear fashion to the attainment of more social or political power. Refining and challenging the assumption that modern liberal societies inevitably thrive on the accumulation of information about the public personas, private psyches, consumer habits or political proclivities of citizens, the papers in the special issue explore how the cultivation of strategic unknowns remains a resource – perhaps the greatest resource – for those in a position of power and those subject to it.",Sociology

2403,922.0,"The object of this paper is both critical and constructive. The first section contains a critical account of some leading interpretations of the rise of modern sociology in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in Europe, concentrating primarily on Durkheim but refering also to Max Weber. I try to show that these interpretations, still very commonly held, have to be abandoned as myths. Like all myths, however, they contain a rational kernel, and in seeking to show what this might be, I indicate some lines of development which I consider to be important in sociology in the present day. Most characterizations of the current travails of social theory are concerned with issues of epistemology, that is, with problems of the sorts of ""truth claims"" that can be made in sociology. These matters, undeniably of pressing importance, are related to legacies from 19th-century social thought which we have to disavow. But there is another residue of the 19th century with which we have also to break: this is represented by what I cal the theory of industrial society. An essential task facing contemporary social theory is that of reconciling a revised epistemology of social science with new frameworks for the analysis of the development of advanced societies.",Sociology

The intellectual diffusion of agency theory illustrates this process. Agency theory is a general model of social relations involving the delegation of authority, and generally resulting in problems of control, which has been applied to a broad range of substantive contexts. This paper analyzes applications of agency theory to state policy implementation in economics, political science, and sociology. After documenting variations in the theory across disciplinary contexts, the strengths and weaknesses of these different varieties of agency theory are assessed. Sociological versions of agency theory, incorporating both broader microfoundations and richer models of social structure, are in many respects the most promising. This type of agency theory illustrates the potential of an emerging sociological version of rational choice theory.",Sociology

The concept of lifespan developmental psychology was previously advanced to incorporate two approaches (i.e., wholistic person-centered and function-centered) to lifespan ontogenesis. Historical and societal contexts of theoretical arguments are discussed to embed the current issues surrounding lifespan psychology and its location in the larger field of developmental psychology. Five sequential but interrelated steps are presented to examine psychological theories of lifespan development.

2424,179.0,"We use dissipationless N-body simulations to investigate the evolution of the true coarse-grained phase-space density distribution f(x,v) in equal-mass mergers between dark matter (DM) halos. The halo models are constructed with various asymptotic power-law indices ranging from steep cusps to core-like profiles and we employ the phase-space density estimator ``Enbid'' developed by Sharma &amp; Steinmetz to compute f(x,v). The adopted force resolution allows robust phase-space density profile estimates in the inner ~1% of the virial radii of the simulated systems. We confirm that mergers result in a decrease of the coarse-grained phase-space density in accordance with expectations from Mixing Theorems for collisionless systems. We demonstrate that binary mergers between identical DM halos produce remnants that retain excellent memories of the inner slopes and overall shapes of the phase-space density distribution of their progenitors. The robustness of the phase-space density profiles holds for a range of orbital energies, and a variety of encounter configurations including sequences of several consecutive merger events, designed to mimic hierarchical merging, and collisions occurring at different cosmological epochs. If the progenitor halos are constructed with appreciably different asymptotic power-law indices, we find that the inner slope and overall shape of the phase-space density distribution of the remnant are substantially closer to that of the initial system with the steepest central density cusp. These results explicitly demonstrate that mixing is incomplete in equal-mass mergers between DM halos, as it does not erase memory of the progenitor properties. Our results also confirm the recent analytical predictions of Dehnen (2005) regarding the preservation of merging self-gravitating central density cusps.",Astronomy

Furthermore, the associative sequence learning model of imitation proposes that experience-based Hebbian learning forms links between sensory processing of the actions of others and motor plans. Social psychology studies have demonstrated that imitation and mimicry are pervasive, automatic, and facilitate empathy. Neuroscience investigations have demonstrated physiological mechanisms of mirroring at single-cell and neural-system levels that support the cognitive and social psychology constructs.

Qualitative approaches are often based on fundamentally different values from (post)positivistempiricism, raising important considerations for quality, and whether qualitative work adheres to, and is judged by, appropriate publication standards. Thematic analysis (TA) has become a particularly popular method in qualitative health psychology, but poor practice is widespread. To support high quality, methodologically coherent TA practice and reporting, we critically reviewed 100 systematically selected papers reporting TA, published in five prominent health psychology journals. Our review assessed reported practice, and considered this in relation to methodological and quality recommendations. We identified 10 common areas of problematic practice in the reviewed papers, the majority citing reflexive TA. Considering the role of three ‘arbiters of quality’ in a peer review publication system – authors, reviewers, and editors – we developed 20 recommendations for authors, to support them in conducting and reporting high quality TA research, with associated questions for reviewers and editors to consider when evaluating TA manuscripts for publication. We end with considerations for facilitating better qualitative research, and enriching the understandings and knowledge base from which health psychology is practiced.",Psychology
2434,30.0,"Like other starburst galaxies, M82 hosts compact, massive young star clusters that are interesting both in their own right and as benchmarks for population synthesis models. Can spectral synthesis models at resolutions around 1000 adequately reproduce the near-IR spectral features and the energy distribution of these clusters between 0.8 and 2.4 microns? How do the derived cluster properties compare with previous results from optical studies? We analyse the spectra of 5 massive clusters in M82, using data acquired with the spectrograph SpeX on the InfraRed Telescope Facility (NASA/IRTF) and a new population synthesis tool with a highly improved near-IR extension, based on a recent collection of empirical and theoretical spectra of red supergiant stars. We obtain excellent fits across the near-IR with models at quasi-solar metallicity and a solar neighbourhood extinction law. Spectroscopy breaks a strong degeneracy between age and extinction in the near-IR colours in the red supergiant-dominated phase of evolution. The estimated near-IR ages cluster between 9 and 30 Myr, i.e. the ages at which the molecular bands due to luminous red supergiants are strongest in the current models. They do not always agree with optical spectroscopic ages. Adding optical data sometimes leads to the rejection of the solar neighbourhood extinction law. This is not surprising considering small-scale structure around the clusters, but it has no significant effect on the near-IR based spectroscopic ages. [abridged]",Astronomy
2435,992.0,"In this paper I explore the questions of why and how sociologists should be interested in narrative. The answer to the first question is straightforward: Narrative texts are packed with sociological information, and a great deal of our empirical evidence is in narrative form. In an attempt to answer the second question, I look at definitions of narrative, distinguishing narrative from non-narrative texts. I highlight the linguistic properties of narrative and illustrate modes of analysis, paying close attention to both the structural properties of the text and its subtle linguistic nuances. I guide the reader through a detailed analysis of a short narrative text. I show how linguistics and sociology interplay at the level of a text.",Sociology
2436,929.0,"Over the years, sociology has exhibited a partly dialectical and partly alternating emphasis on the global and on the particular. Many early theorists emphasized the unity of mankind, or attempted to order civilizations according to various theories of history. Subsequently, there was a retreat to description and data collection, particularly in the United States; the rediscovery of other times and other places, but in a predominantly relativistic context; and the use of ""systems"" concepts to exaggerate the sovereignty of society. The renewed quest for generality appears to be partly an autonomous development within the scholarly discipline, as exemplified by ""comparative analysis"" and emphasis on common functional requisites. A seemingly more powerful influence has been the course of contemporary history, which is divisive in important and conspicuous ways, but has elements of unity, such as the universal quest for economic growth and political participation. Though the degree to which common structural features will emerge from somewhat common goals and the use of pooled techniques is an empirical question of great theoretical import, the methodological moral is drawn that our systems must at times cut across national frontiers and, indeed, here and there, become global.",Sociology

A literature review is presented that points to a number of shortcomings in existing studies, most of which are associated with the psychological reductionism that predominates in this area of study. An effort is made to provide a sociological account of voluntary risk taking by (1) introducing a new classifyin concept- edgework-based on numerous themes emerging from primary and secondary data on risk taking and (2) explaining edgework in terms of the newly emerging social psychological perspective produced from the synthesis of the Marxian and Meadian frameworks. The concept of edgework highlights the most sociologically relevant features of voluntary risk taking, while the connections between various aspects of risk-taking behaviour and structural characteristic of modern American society at both the micro and macro levels.

2439,23.0,"Radio synchrotron emission, its polarization and its Faraday rotation are powerful tools to study the strength and structure of interstellar magnetic fields. The total intensity traces the strength and distribution of total magnetic fields. Total fields in gas-rich spiral arms and bars of nearby galaxies have strengths of 20-30 $\mu$Gauss, due to the amplification of turbulent fields, and are dynamically important. In the Milky Way, the total field strength is about 6 $\mu$G near the Sun and several 100 $\mu$G in filaments near the Galactic Center. -- The polarized intensity measures ordered fields with a preferred orientation, which can be regular or anisotropic fields. Ordered fields with spiral structure exist in grand-design, barred, flocculent and even in irregular galaxies. The strongest ordered fields are found in interarm regions, sometimes forming ""magnetic spiral arms"" between the optical arms. Halo fields are X-shaped, probably due to outflows. -- The Faraday rotation of the polarization vectors traces coherent regular fields which have a preferred direction. In some galaxies Faraday rotation reveals large-scale patterns which are signatures of dynamo fields. However, in most galaxies the field has a complicated structure and interacts with local gas flows. In the Milky Way, diffuse polarized radio emission and Faraday rotation of the polarized emission from pulsars and background sources show many small-scale and large-scale magnetic features, but the overall field structure in our Galaxy is still under debate.",Astronomy

The main goal of our high-resolution, high-sensitivity radio observations is to unveil the dominant gas heating mechanism in the central regions of local (U)LIRGs. The main tracer of recent star-formation in (U)LIRGs is the explosion of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), which are the endproducts of the explosion of massive stars and yield bright radio events. Therefore, our observations will not only allow us to answer the question of the dominant heating mechanism in (U)LIRGs, but will yield also the CCSN rate and the star-formation rate (SFR) for the galaxies of the sample.",Astronomy
2441,669.0,"This analysis of the history of the Chicago Board Options Exchange explores the performativity of economics, a theme in economic sociology recently developed by Callon. Economics was crucial to the creation of financial derivatives exchanges: it helped remedy the drastic loss of legitimacy suffered by derivatives in the first half of the 20th century. Option pricing theory—a “crown jewel” of neoclassical economics—succeeded empirically not because it discovered preexisting price patterns but because markets changed in ways that made its assumptions more accurate and because the theory was used in arbitrage. The performativity of economics, however, has limits, and an emphasis on it needs to be combined with classic themes in economic sociology, such as Granovetterian embedding and the way in which exchanges can be cultures and moral communities in which collective action problems can be solved.",Sociology

In 1980 we began to use a hydrogen fluoride gas cell with the CFHT coud\'{e} spectrograph and, for 12 years, monitored RVs of some 29 solar-type stars. Since extra-solar planets were expected to resemble Jupiter in both mass and orbit, we were awarded only three or four two-night observing runs each year.

2446,299.0,"We model the evolution of the abundances of light elements in carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars, under the assumption that such stars are formed by mass transfer in a binary system. We have modelled the accretion of material ejected by an asymptotic giant branch star on to the surface of a companion star. We then examine three different scenarios: one in which the material is mixed only by convective processes, one in which thermohaline mixing is present and a third in which both thermohaline mixing and gravitational settling are taken in to account. The results of these runs are compared to light element abundance measurements in CEMP stars (primarily CEMP-s stars, which are rich in $s$-processes elements and likely to have formed by mass transfer from an AGB star), focusing on the elements Li, F, Na and Mg. None of the elements is able to provide a conclusive picture of the extent of mixing of accreted material. We confirm that lithium can only be preserved if little mixing takes place. The bulk of the sodium observations suggest that accreted material is effectively mixed but there are also several highly Na and Mg-rich objects that can only be explained if the accreted material is unmixed. We suggest that the available sodium data may hint that extra mixing is taking place on the giant branch, though we caution that the data is sparse.",Astronomy
2447,293.0,"In order to get astrometric parameters achieving the precision permitted by the the forthcoming generation of astrometri cmeasurements, it will be necessary to take into account effects that were neglected until the present time. Two effects concerning the orbital elements of binary stars are considered hereafter: the former is the local perspective (LP) effect, which is due to the variation of the distance and of the orientation of the orbital plane during the observation time span. The latter effect is the light--travel time (LTT), which is also related to the orientation of the orbital plane. Taking these effects into account would allow to find the ascending nodes of the orbits, and lead to orbital elements more accurate than when they are ignored. It is derived from simulations that, at a distance of 5 pc, and assuming velocities typical of Pop.I stars, the position of the right ascending node could be derived for a few simulated unresolved binaries when the astrometric measurements have errors around 1 microas. For the resolved brown dwarf binary 2MASS J07464256 +2000321, it appears that ignoring the LP effect would result in underestimating the masses of the components by 14 per cent of the errors as soon as the astrometric errors are around 20 microas for each measurement. However, a `degenerate LP solution', taking into account the variation of the semi-major axis when the distance is varying, should provide reliable masses when the measurement errors are larger than 1 or 2 microas. A few binaries in the Gaia program could deserve a degenerate LP solution, whereas a the complete LP+LTT solution could be justified for resolved binaries observed with SIM.",Astronomy

Socioecological psychology attempts to bring the objectivist perspective to psychological science, investigating how objective social and physical environments, not just perception and construal of the environments, affect one's thinking, feeling, and behaviors, as well as how people's thinking, feeling, and behaviors give rise to social and built environments.",Psychology

The dissemination of psychological knowledge modifies the patterns of behavior upon which the knowledge is based. It does so because of the prescriptive bias of psychological theorizing, the liberating effects of knowledge, and the resistance based on common values of freedom and individuality. In addition, theoretical premises are based primarily on acquired dispositions. As the culture changes, such dispositions are altered, and the premises are often invalidated. Several modifications in the scope and methods of social psychology are derived from this analysis.",Psychology

Stress and other emotional responses are components of complex interactions of genetic, physiological, behavioral, and environmental factors that affect the body's ability to remain or become healthy or to resist or overcome disease. Regulated by nervous, endocrine, and immune systems, and exerting powerful influence on other bodily systems and key health-relevant behaviors, stress and emotion appear to have important implications for the initiation or progression of cancer, HIV, cardiovascular disease, and other illnesses. Health-enhancing and health-impairing behaviors, including diet, exercise, tobacco use, and protection from the sun, can compromise or benefit health and are directed by a number of influences as well. Finally, health behaviors related to being ill or trying to avoid disease or its severest consequences are important. Seeking care and adhering to medical regimens and recommendations for disease surveillance allow for earlier identification of health threats and more effective treatment. Evidence that biobehavioral factors are linked to health in integrated, complex ways continues to mount, and knowledge of these influences has implications for medical outcomes and health care practice.",Psychology

Bertrand Badie and Pierre Birnbaum here persuasively argue that the origin of the state is a social fact, arising out of the peculiar sociohistorical context of Western Europe. Drawing on historical materials and bringing sociological insights to bear on a field long abandoned to jurists and political scientists, the authors lay the foundations for a strikingly original theory of the birth and subsequent diffusion of the state. The book opens with a review of the principal evolutionary theories concerning the origin of the institution proposed by such thinkers as Marx, Durkheim, and Weber. Rejecting these views, the authors set forward and defend their thesis that the state was an ""invention"" rather than a necessary consequence of any other process. Once invented, the state was disseminated outside its Western European birthplace either through imposition or imitation. The study concludes with concrete analyses of the differences in actual state institutions in France, Prussia, Great Britain, the United States, and Switzerland.",Sociology

Lyrical sociology is characterized by an engaged, nonironic stance toward its object of analysis, by specific location of both its subject and its object in social space, and by a momentaneous conception of social time. Lyrical sociology typically uses strong figuration and personification, and aims to communicate its author's emotional stance toward his or her object of study, rather than to “explain” that object.

In contrast, this fraction is about 1/2 for dwarf satellite galaxies. Many red dwarf galaxies are physically associated with more massive halos. In total, about $\sim 45$% of red dwarf galaxies reside in massive halos as satellites, while another $\sim 25$% have a spatial distribution that is much more concentrated towards their nearest massive haloes than other dwarf galaxies. We use mock catalogs to show that the reddest population of non-satellite dwarf galaxies are distributed within about 3 times the virial radii of their nearest massive halos. We suggest that this population of dwarf galaxies are hosted by low-mass halos that have passed through their massive neighbors, and that the same environmental effects that cause satellite galaxies to become red are also responsible for the red colors of this population of galaxies. We do not find any significant radial dependence of the population of dwarf galaxies with the highest concentrations, suggesting that the mechanisms operating on these galaxies affect color more than structure.

This shift in focus--from knowledge acquisition to the adaptive regulation of behavior--provides new ways of thinking about every topic in psychology.

Such research shows that time compression has multiple dimensions, and that the effect of digital devices like the mobile phone is not simply one of acceleration. In particular, I suggest that the social studies of technology offers a richer analysis of the reciprocal relationship between technological innovation and changing time practices. My argument is that while the hitherto neglected temporal dimension in sociological theory is now being addressed, there is an urgent need for increased dialogue to connect social theory with detailed empirical studies. Without this, we will continue to have difficulty distinguishing social science from science fiction.",Sociology

It is not practical to treat here the studies of ATIs in social behavior (e.g., Fiedler, 1973; McGuire, 1969), ATIs in response to drugs and therapy (e.g., Insel & Moos, 1974; Lasagna, 1972; Schildkraut, 1970), or ATIs in learning and motivation generally. I confine myself to ATIs related to instruction, drawing on a comprehensive review Richard Snow and I have just completed (Cronbach & Snow, in press). In that field, several research programs have brought us a long way; particularly to be acknowledged are the sustained inquiries, of Bill McKeachie, Jack Atkinson, Russ Kropp and Fred King, George Stern, David Hunt, Victor Bunderson and Jack Dunham, and Snow and his graduate students. Important as ATIs are proving to be, the line of investigation I advocated in 1957 no longer seems sufficient. Interactions are not confined to the first order; the dimensions of the situation and of the person enter into complex interactions. This complexity forces us to ask once again, Should social science aspire to reduce behavior to laws?",Psychology
2470,354.0,"The literature of social psychology contains a number of phenomena that appear to be paradoxical. For example, persons who face a threatening experience prefer to affiliate with threatened others rather than with nonthreatened others (Schachter, 1959), and persons in groups in which reward is equally distributed are less satisfied compared with persons in groups that include one particularly unfortunate member (Brickman, 1975). The purpose of this article is to show that these phenomena are best construed as social comparison processes and that various phenomena derive from one basic process termed downward comparison; the essence of this process is that persons can enhance their own subjective well-being by comparing themselves with a less fortunate other. In this article I show that downward comparison is a process evoked by negative affect, that there is considerable evidence for self-enhancing comparison processes, and that downward comparison effects are involved in several areas of social-psycho logical research.",Psychology

2473,296.0,"We study the axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric, time-dependent hydrodynamics of gas that is under the influence of the gravity of a super massive black hole (SMBH) and the radiation force produced by a radiatively efficient flow accreting onto the SMBH. We have considered two cases: (1) the formation of an outflow from the accretion of the ambient gas without rotation and (2) that with weak rotation. The main goals of this study are: (1) to examine if there is a significant difference between the models with identical initial and boundary conditions but in different dimensionality (2-D and 3-D), and (2) to understand the gas dynamics in AGN. Our 3-D simulations of a non-rotating gas show small yet noticeable non-axisymmetric small-scale features inside the outflow. The outflow as a whole and the inflow do not seem to suffer from any large-scale instability. In the rotating case, the non-axisymmetric features are very prominent, especially in the outflow which consists of many cold dense clouds entrained in a smoother hot flow. The 3-D outflow is non-axisymmetric due to the shear and thermal instabilities. In both 2-D and 3-D simulations, gas rotation increases the outflow thermal energy flux, but reduces the outflow mass and kinetic energy fluxes. Rotation also leads to time variability and fragmentation of the outflow in the radial and latitudinal directions. The collimation of the outflow is reduced in the models with gas rotation. The time variability in the mass and energy fluxes is reduced in the 3-D case because of the outflow fragmentation in the azimuthal direction. The virial mass estimated from the kinematics of the dense cold clouds found in our 3-D simulations of rotating gas underestimates the actual mass used in the simulations by about 40 %.

2485,830.0,"In this paper, I revisit the relationship of queer theory and sociology in order to address some critical issues around conceiving the subject and the self in sexualities research. I suggest that while sociology and queer theory are not reducible to each other, sociology has its own deconstructionist impulse built into pragmatist and symbolic interactionist analyses of identity and subjectivity that is often overlooked by or reinvented through queer theory. But, conversely, queer theory has a very specific deconstructionist raison d'etre with regard to conceiving the sexual subject that marks its key departure from Foucault and sociology more generally. This deconstructionist mandate, by definition, moves queer theory away from the analysis of self and subject position—including those accruing from race, class and gender—and toward a conception of the self radically disarticulated from the social. This “anti-identitarian” position has been a source of criticism among some sociologists who find in queer theory an indefensible “refusal to name a subject” (Seidman 1993:132). But this criticism, I suggest, stems from a misplaced effort to synthesize queer theory and sociology when, in fact, the two approaches to the subject are founded on incommensurable methodological and epistemological principles. Rather, I argue that the very promise of queer theory rests in a strong deconstructionism that exists in tension with, rather than as an extension of, sociological approaches to the self.",Sociology
2486,63.0,"Earlier studies of grain alignment dealt mostly with interstellar grains that have strong internal relaxation of energy which aligns grain axis of maximum moment of inertia with respect to grain's angular momentum. In this paper, we study the alignment by radiative torques for large irregular grains, e.g., grains in accretion disks, for which internal relaxation is subdominant. We use both numerical calculations and the analytical model of a helical grain introduced by us earlier. We demonstrate that grains in such a regime exhibit more complex dynamics. In particular, if initially the grain axis of maximum moment of inertia makes a small angle with angular momentum, then radiative torques can align the grain axis of maximum moment of inertia with angular momentum, and both axis of maximum moment of inertia and angular momentum are aligned with the magnetic field when attractors with high angular momentum (high-J attractors) are available. For the alignment without high-J attractors, beside the earlier studied attractors with low angular momentum (low-J attractors), there appears new low-J attractors. The former and later cases correspond to the alignment with long axes perpendicular and parallel to the angular momentum, respectively. In addition, we study the alignment of grains in the presence of strong internal relaxation, but induced not by a radiation beam as in earlier studies, instead, induced by a complex radiation field, that can be decomposed into dipole and quadrupole components. We find that in this situation, the parameter space $q^{max}$, for the existence of high-$J$ attractors is more extended, which entails higher degrees of polarization expected. Our obtained results are useful for modeling polarization arising from aligned grains in molecular clouds and accretion disks.",Astronomy

The aim of this article is to achieve that, while returning to the basic premise that sociology is the primary discipline that charts changes within the world-society. Two typical subjects for the sociology of globalization can be distinguished: defining what is ‘global’ at first sight and the identification of similar changes in (almost) all countries. However, can national-born concepts help to explain these subjects? This is debated by considering the sociology of social movements (Touraine) and the sociology of the elite (Aron and Rocher) to explain power in the study of alterglobalist movements. The authors conclude that in order to understand world metamorphosis, there is an urgency to make available accurate and reliable data and match universally recognized definitions.

2498,254.0,"The radiation background above the ionization edge of HeII varies strongly during and after helium reionization, because the attenuation length of such photons is relatively short (&lt;40 Mpc) and because the ionizing sources (quasars) are rare. Here we construct analytic and Monte Carlo models to examine these fluctuations, including, for the first time, those during the reionization era itself. In agreement with detailed numerical simulations, our analytic model for the post-reionization Universe predicts order-of-magnitude fluctuations in the HeII ionization rate. Observations of the hardness ratio between HeII/HI show even larger fluctuations, which may be due to more complicated radiative transfer effects. During reionization, the fluctuations are even stronger. In contrast to hydrogen reionization, our model predicts that regions with strong HeII Lyman-alpha forest transmission should be reasonably common even during the beginning stages of reionization, because of strong illumination from bright quasars. Partly due to this, the mean ionizing background does not evolve strongly during and after helium reionization; it is roughly proportional to the filling fraction of HeIII regions. On the other hand, regions full of HeII and also ""fossil"" ionized regions that contain no (or few) active sources appear as strong IGM absorbers. Their presence exaggerates the evolution of the hardness ratio, making it evolve faster than naively expected during the reionization era.",Astronomy
2499,223.0,"We perform SPH simulations of the collapse and fragmentation of low-mass cores having different initial levels of turbulence (alpha_turb=0.05,0.10,0.25). We use a new treatment of the energy equation which captures the transport of cooling radiation against opacity due to both dust and gas (including the effects of dust sublimation, molecules, and H^- ions). We also perform comparison simulations using a standard barotropic equation of state. We find that -- when compared with the barotropic equation of state -- our more realistic treatment of the energy equation results in more protostellar objects being formed, and a higher proportion of brown dwarfs; the multiplicity frequency is essentially unchanged, but the multiple systems tend to have shorter periods (by a factor ~3), higher eccentricities, and higher mass ratios. The reason for this is that small fragments are able to cool more effectively with the new treatment, as compared with the barotropic equation of state. We find that the process of fragmentation is often bimodal. The first protostar to form is usually, at the end, the most massive, i.e. the primary. However, frequently a disc-like structure subsequently forms round this primary, and then, once it has accumulated sufficient mass, quickly fragments to produce several secondaries. We believe that this delayed fragmentation of a disc-like structure is likely to be an important source of very low-mass hydrogen-burning stars and brown dwarfs.",Astronomy

Every advance in culture, it has been said, commences with a new period of migration and movement of populations. Present endencies indicate that while the mobility of individuals has increased, the migration of peoples has relatively decreased. The consequences, however, of migration and mobility seem, on the whole, to be the same. In both cases the ""cake of custom"" is broken and the individual is freed for new enterprises and for new associations. One of the consequences of migration is to create a situation in which the same individual-who may or may not be a mixed blood-finds himself striving to live in two diverse cultural groups. The effect is to produce an unstable character-a personality type with characteristic forms of behavior. This is the ""marginal man.""

2505,883.0,"It is frequently argued that classical sociology, if not sociology as a whole, cannot provide any significant insight into globalization, primarily because its assumptions about the nation-state, national cultures and national societies are no longer relevant to a global world. Sociology cannot consequently contribute to a normative debate about cosmopolitanism, which invites us to consider loyalties and identities that reach beyond the nation-state. My argument considers four principal topics. First, I defend the classical legacy by arguing that classical sociology involved the study of 'the social' not national societies. This argument is illustration by reference to Emile Durkheim and Talcott Parsons. Secondly, Durkheim specifically developed the notion of a cosmopolitan sociology to challenge the nationalist assumptions of his day. Thirdly, I attempt to develop a critical version of Max Weber's verstehende soziologie to consider the conditions for critical recognition theory in sociology as a necessary precondition of cosmopolitanism. Finally, I consider the limitations of some contemporary versions of global sociology in the example of 'flexible citizenship' to provide an empirical case study of the limitations of globalization processes and 'sociology beyond society'. While many institutions have become global, some cannot make this transition. Hence, we should consider the limitations on as well as the opportunities for cosmopolitan sociology.",Sociology

2507,886.0,"Concern with multi-faceted or ‘plural’ conceptions of justice has grown within policy sociology. This paper briefly summarizes some of the dimensions and facets of such plural models and considers their implications for policy sociology. Three implications, in particular, are considered. It is suggested that: first, plural models of justice substantially enlarge the agenda of evaluation; second, tensions within and between different facets of justice need to be acknowledged and responded to; and third, plural models entail a collapse of the distinction between evaluation and action. The paper argues that the latter two implications are frequently overlooked in policy sociology, particularly in work with a dominant focus on critiquing educational and social reproduction in a style the paper labels ‘sociology from above’. By contrast, the paper discusses examples of scholarship that meet the challenges of plural models — scholarship that has more in common with the cultural studies tradition. In so doing, the paper indicates the importance of a ‘sociology of just practices’, and a modified ‘reflective equilibrium’ approach is identified as one means of developing such a sociology.",Sociology

2509,316.0,"This article examines concepts of the trustworthiness, or credibility, of qualitative research. Following a “researcher-as-instrument,” or self-reflective, statement, the paradigmatic underpinnings of various criteria for judging the quality of qualitative research are explored, setting the stage for a discussion of more transcendent standards (those not associated with specific paradigms) for conducting quality research: social validity, subjectivity and reflexivity, adequacy of data, and adequacy of interpretation. Finally, current guidelines for writing and publishing qualitative research are reviewed, and strategies for conducting and writing qualitative research reports are suggested. Qualitative research, ensuing from a variety of disciplines, paradigms, and epistemologies, embraces multiple standards of quality, known variously as validity, credibility, rigor ,o rtrustworthiness. In addition to some standards that may be thought of as somewhat universal across disciplines and paradigms, the “goodness” (Morrow & Smith, 2000) of qualitative inquiry is assessed on the basis of the paradigmatic underpinnings of the research and the standards of the discipline. Thus, a grounded theory study or a consensual qualitative research investigation in counseling psychology that is rooted in a postpositivist or constructivist/interpretivist paradigm will look quite different from a critical ethnography in education; and the standards appropriate for evaluating these studies will vary accordingly. I begin this article by addressing the paradigmatic underpinnings of trustworthiness or rigor in qualitative research. Next, I discuss central topics related to trustworthiness or validity that span paradigms and may be thought of as relevant across most research designs.

Fourth, some key strategies for promoting the use of evidence in I–O psychology are considered: practice-oriented research and systematic reviews. Fifth, barriers to practicing evidence-based I–O psychology are identified along with suggestions for overcoming them. Last is a look to the future of an evidence-based I–O psychology that plays an important role in helping consultants, in-house I–O psychologists, managers, and organizations become more evidence based.",Psychology
2512,902.0,"Abstract Arguing that the phenomenon of global environmental change has received inadequate attention within environmental sociology and that the predominant approach of environmental sociology to global change has been limited, this article suggests several new perspectives. Environmental sociology must give more attention to the social construction of environmental knowledge, by building on and transcending the debates within the sociology of science of the past 15 years. At the same time, environmental sociology must rethink its theories that give analytical priority to the nation‐state and to national units of analysis. These principles are illustrated through analyses of the role of global constructions of environmental knowledge and the recent politics of global environmental change.",Sociology

2514,369.0,"Poverty remains one of the most pressing problems facing the world; the mechanisms through which poverty arises and perpetuates itself, however, are not well understood. Here, we examine the evidence for the hypothesis that poverty may have particular psychological consequences that can lead to economic behaviors that make it difficult to escape poverty. The evidence indicates that poverty causes stress and negative affective states which in turn may lead to short-sighted and risk-averse decision-making, possibly by limiting attention and favoring habitual behaviors at the expense of goal-directed ones. Together, these relationships may constitute a feedback loop that contributes to the perpetuation of poverty. We conclude by pointing toward specific gaps in our knowledge and outlining poverty alleviation programs that this mechanism suggests.",Psychology
2515,176.0,"The negative pressure accompanying gravitationally-induced particle creation can lead to a cold dark matter (CDM) dominated, accelerating Universe (Lima et al. 1996) without requiring the presence of dark energy or a cosmological constant. In a recent study Lima et al. (2008, LSS) demonstrated that particle creation driven cosmological models are capable of accounting for the SNIa observations of the recent transition from a decelerating to an accelerating Universe. Here we test the evolution of such models at high redshift using the constraint on z_eq, the redshift of the epoch of matter radiation equality, provided by the WMAP constraints on the early Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect. Since the contribution of baryons and radiation was ignored in the work of LSS, we include them in our study of this class of models. The parameters of these more realistic models with continuous creation of CDM is tested and constrained at widely-separated epochs (z = z_eq and z = 0) in the evolution of the Universe. This comparison reveals a tension between the high redshift CMB constraint on z_eq and that which follows from the low redshift SNIa data, challenging the viability of this class of models.",Astronomy

There is a great deal of agreement that markets are social structures characterized by extensive social relationships between firms, workers, suppliers, customers, and governments. But, like in many sociological literatures, the theory camps that have formed often seem to speak by each other. We show that some of the disagreement between theory camps is due to differences in conceptual language, and other disagreements stem from the fact that theory camps ignore the concepts in other theory camps, thereby making their theories less complete. We end by considering deeper controversies in the literature that seem open both to new conceptualization and further empirical research.",Sociology

2519,73.0,"The Kozai mechanism often destabilises high inclination orbits. It couples changes in the eccentricity and inclination, and drives high inclination, circular orbits to low inclination, eccentric orbits. In a recent study of the dynamics of planetesimals in the quadruple star system HD98800 (Verrier &amp; Evans 2008), there were significant numbers of stable particles in circumbinary polar orbits about the inner binary pair which are apparently able to evade the Kozai instability. Here, we isolate this feature and investigate the dynamics through numerical and analytical models. The results show that the Kozai mechanism of the outer star is disrupted by a nodal libration induced by the inner binary pair on a shorter timescale. By empirically modelling the period of the libration, a criteria for determining the high inclination stability limits in general triple systems is derived. The nodal libration feature is interesting and, although effecting inclination and node only, shows many parallels to the Kozai mechanism. This raises the possibility that high inclination planets and asteroids may be able to survive in multistellar systems.",Astronomy

Like the sociology literature, it emphasizes that behavior is often best predicted by the analysis of group as well as individual incentives; and it gropes toward a precise definition of concepts such as ""power,"" ""cliques,"" ""corporate politics,"" and ""bureaucracy"" (Crozier, 1963; Cyert and March; Dalton; Scott). It differs from this literature in that it tries to incorporate the acquired knowledge of modern information economics into the analysis. The research also borrows a considerable amount from the principal/agent paradigm of information economics. This paradigm, mainly developed for two-tier organizations, emphasizes the productive inefficiency associated with asymmetric information and insurance motives (or limited liability constraints).' Formally, organizations can be seen as networks of overlapping or nested principal/agent relationships. A theme of the paper, however, is that the analysis of hierarchical structures does not boil down to a compounding of the basic inefficiency, due to the fact that going from the simple two-tier principal/agent structure to more complex ones introduces the possibility of",Sociology

The addictions field has experienced its own growth in a positive direction, embodied by the recovery movement. Despite parallel developments, and great momentum on both sides, there has been little crosspollination. This article introduces positive psychology and the recovery movement, describes the research on positive psychology in the addictions, and discusses future avenues of theory, research, and intervention based on a positive-psychology framework. A systematic review of positive psychology applied to substance use, addiction, and recovery found nine studies which are discussed according to the following themes: theoretical propositions, character strengths and drinking, positive psychology and recovery, positive interventions, and addiction: feeling good and feeling bad. The current scholarship is scant, but diverse, covering a wide range of populations (adults, adolescents, those in and out of treatment), topics (character strengths, recovery, positive affect), and addictive behaviors (work addiction, cigarette smoking, and alcohol use disorders). There is diversity, too, in country of origin, with work originating in the U.S., U.K., Poland, and Spain. The rigorous application of the lens, tools, and approaches of positive psychology to addiction research generally, and to the aims of the recovery movement specifically, has potential for the development of theory and innovation in prevention and intervention. Further, because the work in positive psychology has primarily focused on microsystems, it may be primed to make contributions to the predominantly macrosystems focus of the recovery movement.

2528,233.0,"Using time evolutions of the relevant linearised equations we study non-axisymmetric oscillations of rapidly rotating and superfluid neutron stars. We consider perturbations of Newtonian axisymmetric background configurations and account for the presence of superfluid components via the standard two-fluid model. Within the Cowling approximation, we are able to carry out evolutions for uniformly rotating stars up to the mass-shedding limit. This leads to the first detailed analysis of superfluid neutron star oscillations in the fast rotation regime, where the star is significantly deformed by the centrifugal force. For simplicity, we focus on background models where the two fluids (superfluid neutrons and protons) co-rotate, are in beta-equilibrium and coexist throughout the volume of the star. We construct sequences of rotating stars for two analytical model equations of state. These models represent relatively simple generalisations of single fluid, polytropic stars. We study the effects of entrainment, rotation and symmetry energy on non-radial oscillations of these models. Our results show that entrainment and symmetry energy can have a significant effect on the rotational splitting of non-axisymmetric modes. In particular, the symmetry energy modifies the inertial mode frequencies considerably in the regime of fast rotation.",Astronomy

This research presents a model of sense of place based in conventional social psychology: cognitions, attitudes, identities, and behavioral intentions located in and fundamentally about place. A survey of property owners in Vilas County, Wisconsin, revealed the importance of symbolic meanings as underpinning both place satisfaction, conceptualized as an attitude toward a setting, and attachment, conceptualized as personal identification with a setting. In turn, attachment, satisfaction, and meanings all have independent effects on willingness to engage in behaviors that maintain or enhance valued attributes of the setting.",Psychology

To understand how these categories depend on one another for meaning and are jointly associated with outcomes, reconceptualization of the meaning and significance of the categories is necessary. To accomplish this, the author presents 3 questions for psychologists to ask: Who is included within this category? What role does inequality play? Where are there similarities? The 1st question involves attending to diversity within social categories. The 2nd conceptualizes social categories as connoting hierarchies of privilege and power that structure social and material life. The 3rd looks for commonalities across categories commonly viewed as deeply different. The author concludes with a discussion of the implications and value of these 3 questions for each stage of the research process.",Psychology
2531,62.0,"Astrophysical fluids are generically turbulent, which means that frozen-in magnetic fields are, at least, weakly stochastic. Therefore realistic studies of astrophysical magnetic reconnection should include the effects of stochastic magnetic field. In the paper we discuss and test numerically the Lazarian &amp; Vishniac (1999) model of magnetic field reconnection of weakly stochastic fields. The turbulence in the model is assumed to be subAlfvenic, with the magnetic field only slightly perturbed. The model predicts that the degree of magnetic field stochasticity controls the reconnection rate and that the reconnection can be fast independently on the presence or absence of anomalous plasma effects. For testing of the model we use 3D MHD simulations. To measure the reconnection rate we employ both the inflow of magnetic flux and a more sophisticated measure that we introduce in the paper. Both measures of reconnection provide consistent results. Our testing successfully reproduces the dependences predicted by the model, including the variations of the reconnection speed with the variations of the injection scale of turbulence driving as well as the intensity of driving. We conclude that, while anomalous and Hall-MHD effects in particular circumstances may be important for the initiation of reconnection, the generic astrophysical reconnection is fast due to turbulence, irrespectively of the microphysical plasma effects involved. This conclusion justifies numerical modeling of many astrophysical environments, e.g. interstellar medium, for which plasma-effect-based collisionless reconnection is not applicable.",Astronomy

The impact of this principle on diffusion of influence and information, mobility opportunity, and community organization is explored. Stress is laid on the cohesive power of weak ties. Most network models deal, implicitly, with strong ties, thus confining their applicability to small, well-defined groups.

The availability of new telescopes and the recent technical development towards larger observing bandwidth and higher data-rates now allow to image with 3mm-VLBI hundreds of sources with high dynamic range. As an example we show new images of the jets of Cygnus A. At 1.3 mm, pilot VLBI studies have proven detectability of the brightest AGN, and the existence of ultra-compact regions therein. In the next few years global VLBI imaging will be established also at 1.3 mm and 0.85 mm wavelength. With an angular resolution in the 10-20 micro-arcsecond range, future 1.3 mm- and 0.8 mm VLBI will be an extraordinarily powerful astronomical observing method, allowing to image the enigmatic `central engines' and the foot-points of AGN-jets in greater detail than ever possible before. A sufficiently large number of telescopes is a prerequisite for global aperture synthesis imaging. Therefore a strong effort is needed to make more telescopes available for VLBI at short millimeter and sub-millimeter wavelengths. In this context, the further VLBI upgrade of both IRAM telescopes and the outfit of the APEX telescope in Chile, in preparation for later mm-/sub-mm VLBI with ALMA, is of high scientific importance. With a sufficiently large mm-VLBI network, the micro-arcsecond scale imaging of the post-Newtonian emission zone around the event horizon/ergosphere of nearby super-massive Black Holes (such as e.g. Sgr A*, M87, ...) should become possible within the next few years.",Astronomy

This comprises four elements: a sociology of environmental knowledges; social variation in the reading of natures; a sociology of the diverse forms of environmental damage; and a more general examination of environmentalism and society. We conclude with an examination of the relations between culture and nature suggesting that changes in this relationship now demonstrates what has always been the case, namely, that nature is elaborately entangled and fundamentally bound up with the social and the cultural.

Advances to the theory have principally concerned implicative relationships between constructs, construing of the self, social relationships, emotions, links with other approaches, and supporting research. With regard to methods of assessment of construing, major developments have occurred in both repertory grid and nongrid techniques, such as laddering. The principal advances in the applications of PCP have been in the clinical, educational, and organizational fields, but have by no means been limited to these areas. It can be concluded that PCP has met Kelly's own design specifications for a useful theory and that PCP can perhaps anticipate at least another half-century of elaboration.",Psychology
2543,918.0,"Sociology of science deals with the social conditions and effects of science, and with the social structures and processes of scientific activity. Science is a cultural tradi­ tion, preserved and transmitted from generation to generation partly because it is valued in its own right, and partly because of its wide technological applications. Its most distinguishing characteristic is that the primary purpose of its cultivators, the scientists, is to change the tradition through discoveries. This bears some simi­ larity to the purpose of modern artists and writers. But innovations in art and literature are accompanied by dissension and conflict, because there are no explicit criteria and accepted procedures to determine whether an innovation is an improve­ ment or deterioration of existing tradition. Although scientific criteria and proce­ dures are neither perfectly unequivocal nor entirely stable, they are still far superior to criteria used in the evaluation of other cultural products. The relatively objective, consensual evaluation of discoveries makes science an extreme case of institutionally regulated cultural change. Sociologists of science have concentrated on this characteristic of science as a tradition and as an institution. The questions they deal with are: How did this unique tradition of modern science emerge and become institutionalized? How is it maintained and controlled? How is research organized? What determines changes in scientific organization, and how are these changes related to research? These are wide-ranging problems, difficult to delimit. Our task of setting limits to this survey has been further complicated by the fact that the sociology of science, as of other cultural fields, is the common interest of several different disciplines. In our selection we concentrate on issues in which important work has been done during the last five years, but we also include earlier work to the extent that this is necessary as background for current developments.

2544,83.0,"We argue that both the positron fraction measured by PAMELA and the peculiar spectral features reported in the total electron-positron (e+e-) flux measured by ATIC have a very natural explanation in electron-positron pairs produced by nearby pulsars. While this possibility was pointed out a long time ago, the greatly improved quality of current data potentially allow to reverse-engineer the problem: given the regions of pulsar parameter space favored by PAMELA and by ATIC, are there known pulsars that explain the data with reasonable assumptions on the injected e+e- pairs? In the context of simple benchmark models for estimating the e+e- output, we consider all known pulsars, as listed in the most complete available catalogue. We find that it is unlikely that a single pulsar be responsible for both the PAMELA e+ fraction anomaly and for the ATIC excess, although two single sources are in principle enough to explain both experimental results. The PAMELA excess e+ likely come from a set of mature pulsars (age ~ 10^6 yr), with a distance of 0.8-1 kpc, or from a single, younger and closer source like Geminga. The ATIC data require a larger (and less plausible) energy output, and favor an origin associated to powerful, more distant (1-2 kpc) and younger (age ~ 10^5$ yr) pulsars. We list several candidate pulsars that can individually or coherently contribute to explain the PAMELA and ATIC data. Although generally suppressed, we find that the contribution of pulsars more distant than 1-2 kpc could contribute for the ATIC excess. Finally, we stress the multi-faceted and decisive role that Fermi-LAT will play in the very near future by (1) providing an exquisite measurement of the e+e- flux, (2) unveiling the existence of as yet undetected pulsars, and (3) searching for anisotropies in the arrival direction of high-energy e+e-.",Astronomy
2545,154.0,"Stationary solutions to the equations of non-linear diffusive shock acceleration play a fundamental role in the theory of cosmic-ray acceleration. Their existence usually requires that a fraction of the accelerated particles be allowed to escape from the system. Because the scattering mean-free-path is thought to be an increasing function of energy, this condition is conventionally implemented as an upper cut-off in energy space -- particles are then permitted to escape from any part of the system, once their energy exceeds this limit. However, because accelerated particles are responsible for substantial amplification of the ambient magnetic field in a region upstream of the shock front, we examine an alternative approach in which particles escape over a spatial boundary. We use a simple iterative scheme that constructs stationary numerical solutions to the coupled kinetic and hydrodynamic equations. For parameters appropriate for supernova remnants, we find stationary solutions with efficient acceleration when the escape boundary is placed at the point where growth and advection of strongly driven non-resonant waves are in balance. We also present the energy dependence of the distribution function close to the energy where it cuts off - a diagnostic that is in principle accessible to observation.",Astronomy

2548,737.0,"John Urry’s (2010 [2000]) Mobile Sociology remains as relevant as when it was first published. His ‘manifesto for sociology’ reveals the kind of grand plans that only theoreticians of Urry’s standing have the courage to advance. His eloquent argument for a sociology that attends to ‘the diverse mobilities of peoples, objects, images, information, and wastes; and of the complex interdependencies between, and social consequences of, such diverse mobilities’ shifted the discipline onto new conceptual ground and framed new agendas for researchers, proposing new questions, theories and methodologies (Sheller and Urry 2006: 211). In Mobile Sociology ‘the social as mobility’ (Urry 2010 [2000]: 348 [186]), with ‘global civil society’ as its social base, replaced the ‘social as society’ (Urry 2010 [2000]: 348 [186]), a scheme developed in conversation with a broader set of arguments articulated by Mol and Law (1994), in Castells’ (1996) account of networks as dynamic open structures, and the intertwining of human and physical worlds (Urry 2010 [2000]: 356–7 [194]) acknowledging that humans do not act independently from objects. Urry offers ‘complexity’, ‘inhuman, mobile intersecting hybrids’ as the ‘basis of post-social knowledge’ (Urry 2010 [2000]: 357 [195]). This chimed with developments in intersecting disciplines. Anthropology was rethinking culture in motion (Clifford 1997), and the production of migrant activities and subjectivities as place-making on the hoof (Rapport 1995). Geographers generated more dynamic approaches to spatiality, foregrounding intersection and connection; the run of life had found its pace and Thrift and Dewsbury’s (2000) ‘Dead Geographies and How to Make Them Live’, captured this zeitgeist.The mobility and dynamism of social worlds were no longer arrested in the analytic gaze: henceforth knowledge must be mobile (Merleau-Ponty 2002; Bauman 2000). Mobility’s moment deepens; which is why it is important to republish this paper and reflect on it further.

The observed positron fraction appears larger than the actual theoretical predictions for energies larger than 10 GeV. The indirect evidences of Dark Matter in connection with Beyond the Standard Model theories would suggest the existence of an extra contribution present in the cosmic ray signal. We study and calculate the positron signal produced by the annihilation of a generic Dark Matter candidate. Especially, We analyze typical annihilation signatures and the impact of CR propagation physics on the positron signal. In addition, we study the positron signal related to spallation processes between nuclei cosmic--rays and the interstellar gas. We analyze the effects of uncertainties present in nuclear cross section, nuclei cosmic--ray and CR propagation physics. The propagation of positrons is modeled according to the Two--Zone Propagation Model which has been successfully tested in the study of nuclei cosmic--ray and present an analytical approach to study the cosmic--ray physics.",Astronomy

2555,259.0,"In cyclic universe models based on a single scalar field (e.g., the radion determining the distance between branes in M-theory), virtually the entire universe makes it through the ekpyrotic smoothing and flattening phase, bounces, and enters a new epoch of expansion and cooling. This stable evolution cannot occur, however, if scale-invariant curvature perturbations are produced by the entropic mechanism because it requires two scalar fields (e.g., the radion and the Calabi-Yau dilaton) evolving along an unstable classical trajectory. In fact, we show here that an overwhelming fraction of the universe fails to make it through the ekpyrotic phase; nevertheless, a sufficient volume survives and cycling continues forever provided the dark energy phase of the cycle lasts long enough, of order a trillion years. Two consequences are a new role for dark energy and a global structure of the universe radically different from that of eternal inflation.",Astronomy

Before the crisis, disintermediation and securitization changed how the U.S. financial system operated, as bank operations shifted from the traditional originate-and-hold model to originate-and-distribute. During the 1980s and 1990s, the overall size and profitability of the financial system grew as deregulation unleashed financial innovation and reorganization. Global shifts toward capital market integration and liberalization created greater global interdependence. Households in the years before the crisis also altered their relationship to the financial system, increasing debt loads and overall exposure to the stock market.

More work has been done at the micro-level than the macro-level of analysis. At both analytical levels, emotion most commonly is treated as a dependent variable, although increasingly, its role as an intervening and independent variable in social processes is being recognized, especially with regard to problems in substantive fields as diverse as gender roles, stress, small groups, social movements, and stratification. Considerable gaps exist in sociological knowledge about emotions; in particular, little is known about distribution of different emotional experiences in the population, the content of emotion culture, emotional socialization processes, emotional interactions, and relationships between social structure and emotion norms. More empirical research is necessary, to build on the theoretical groundwork that has been laid. Problems in measuring emotional experience and aspects of emotion culture have not been addressed and are likely to become critical issues as empirical work accumulates in the future.",Sociology
2559,198.0,"We describe a method for incorporating ambipolar diffusion in the strong coupling approximation into a multidimensional magnetohydrodynamics code based on the total variation diminishing scheme. Contributions from ambipolar diffusion terms are included by explicit finite difference operators in a fully unsplit way, maintaining second order accuracy. The divergence-free condition of magnetic fields is exactly ensured at all times by a flux-interpolated constrained transport scheme. The super time stepping method is used to accelerate the timestep in high resolution calculations and/or in strong ambipolar diffusion. We perform two test problems, the steady-state oblique C-type shocks and the decay of Alfv\'en waves, confirming the accuracy and robustness of our numerical approach. Results from the simulations of the compressible MHD turbulence with ambipolar diffusion show the flexibility of our method as well as its ability to follow complex MHD flows in the presence of ambipolar diffusion. These simulations show that the dissipation rate of MHD turbulence is strongly affected by the strength of ambipolar diffusion.",Astronomy

Such an analysis portrays the ways in which the separate and joint actions of two persons affect the quality of their lives and the survival of their relationship. The authors focus on patterns of interdependence, and on the assumption that these patterns play an important causal role in the processes, roles, and norms of relationships.

2561,797.0,"We argue for a sociology of health, illness, and disease. Under the influence of Talcott Parsons, the social study of health began as medical sociology and then morphed into sociology of health and illness, focusing largely on the social aspects of health-related topics. Social scientists have been reluctant to tackle disease in its physiological and biological manifestations. The result is an impoverishment of sociological analysis on at least three levels: social scientists have rarely made diseases central to their inquiries; they have been reluctant to include clinical endpoints in their analysis; and they have largely bracketed the normative purpose of health interventions. Consequently, social scientists tend to ignore what often matters most to patients and health care providers, and the social processes social scientists describe remain clinically unanchored. A sociology of disease explores the dialectic between social life and disease; aiming to examine whether and how social life matters for morbidity and mortality and vice versa. Drawing from specific advances in science and technology studies and social epidemiology, we point to ways that sociologists can participate as health researchers.",Sociology
2562,171.0,"The measurement of the gravitational lens delay time between light paths has relied, to date, on the source having sufficient variability to allow photometric variations from each path to be compared. However, the delay times of many gravitational lenses cannot be measured because the intrinsic source amplitude variations are too small to be detectable. At the fundamental quantum mechanical level, such photometric time stamps allow which-path knowledge, removing the ability to obtain an interference pattern. However, if the two paths can be made equal (zero time delay) then interference can occur. We describe an interferometric approach to measuring gravitational lens delay times using a quantum-eraser/restorer approach, whereby the time travel along the two paths may be rendered measurably equal. Energy and time being non-commuting observables, constraints on the photon energy in the energy-time uncertainty principle, via adjustments of the width of the radio bandpass, dictate the uncertainty of the time delay and therefore whether the path taken along one or the other gravitational lens geodesic is knowable. If one starts with interference, for example, which-path information returns when the bandpass is broadened (constraints on the energy are relaxed) to the point where the uncertainty principle allows a knowledge of the arrival time to better than the gravitational lens delay time itself, at which point the interference will disappear. We discuss the near-term feasibility of such measurements in light of current narrow-band radio detectors and known short time-delay gravitational lenses.",Astronomy
2563,174.0,"All accretion models of gamma-ray bursts share a common assumption: accretion power and gravitational binding energy is released and then dissipated locally, with the mass of its origin. This is equivalent to the Shakura-Sunyaev 1973 (SS73) prescription for the dissipation of accretion power and subsequent conversion into radiate output. Since their seminal paper, broadband observations of quasars and black hole X-ray binaries insist that the SS73 prescription cannot wholly describe their behavior. In particular, optically thick black hole accretion flows are almost universally accompanied by coronae whose relative power by far exceeds anything seen in studies of stellar chromospheric and coronal activity. In this note, we briefly discuss the possible repercussions of freeing accretion models of GRBs from the SS73 prescription. Our main conclusion is that the efficiency of converting gravitational binding energy into a GRB power can be increased by an order of magnitude or more.",Astronomy

In this work, we realize scale invariant perturbations from thermal fluctuations in (conformal) radiation during a radiation dominated contraction era prior to inflation. As the modes exit the Hubble radius during the contraction phase, scale invariant fluctuations are indeed generated. After many cycles, we enter into a power-law inflationary phase, that stretches the modes produced in the previous contraction phase to scales that we observe today.",Astronomy

It is in particular in situations of dispute that a need arises to explicate the grounds on which responsibility for errors is distributed and on which new agreement can be reached. Since a plurality of mutually incompatible modes of justification exists, disputes can be understood as disagreements either about whether the accepted rule of justification has not been violated or about which mode of justification to apply at all. The article develops a grammar of such modes of justification, called orders of worth (grandeur), and argues that the human capacity for criticism becomes visible in the daily occurrence of disputes over criteria for justification. At the same time, it is underlined that not all social situations can be interpreted with the help of such a sense of justice, which resides on a notion of equivalence.

2569,610.0,"The theory of social representations occupies a place apart in social psychology both by the problems it raises and the scale of the phenomena with which it deals. This provokes many a criticism and misunderstanding. Such a theory may not correspond with the model of social psychology as it is defined at present. One attempts however to show that it answers important social and scientific questions, in what it differs from the classical conception of collective representations and, from the very beginning, adopts a constructivist perspective which has spread in social psychology since. Several trends of research have confirmed its vision of the relations between social and cognitive phenomena, communication and thought. More detailed remarks aim at outlining the nature of social representations, their capacity to create information, their function which is to familiarize us with the strange, according to the categories of our culture. Going farther, one insists on the diversity of methodological approaches. If the experimental method is useful to understand how people should think, higher mental and social processes must be approached by different methods, including linguistic analysis and observation of how people think. No doubt, social representations have a relation with the more recent field of social cognition. But inasmuch as the former depend on content and context, i.e. subjectivity and sociability of people, they approach the phenomena differently from the latter. Referring to child psychology and anthropology, one can contend, despite appearances, that it is also a more scientific approach. There is however much to be learned from criticisms and there is still a long way to go before we arrive at a satisfactory theory of social thinking and communication.",Psychology

Distinguishing these domains highlights a need to marry two approaches to research methodology: the classical approach, which we describe as snapshot, bookend, between-group experimentation; and a microgenetic approach that traces proximal cause-effect bonds over time to validate theoretical accounts of how learning generates achievements.

2576,819.0,Sociological perspectives and research provide important and distinctive contributions to the understanding of entrepreneurship in three ways. The first is through the development of societal conceptions regarding productive activities that encompass the entrepreneurial role or function. The major alternatives emphasize socioeconomic systems as (a) moving toward an equilibrium (reflecting a broad consensus) or (b) reflecting the outcome of class competition (emphasizing conflict resolution). Both assume the inevitable dominance of massive productive organizations. These conceptions have recently been supplemented with attention to the dual nature of advanced economies or the benefits of flexible specialization. The second is through attention to specific societal characteristics affecting entrepreneurship: modernization; the role of the state in economic development; variations in the scope and nature of the unregistered (underground) economy; and the character of organizational populations and their ecological niche as they affect new firm foundings. The third is through attention to the impact of social context on the decisions of individuals to pursue entrepreneurial options.

2581,894.0,"Sociology, writes Irving Louis Horowitz, has changed from a central discipline of the social sciences to an ideological outpost of political extremism. As a result, the field is in crisis. Some departments have been shut down, others cut back, research programs have dried up, and the growth of professional organizations and student enrollments have been either curbed or atrophied. In The Decomposition of Sociology, Professor Horowitz, for four decades a leading social scientist, offers a frank and full account of the maelstrom engulfing this field. Horowitz pulls no punches in this provocative volume. He charges that much contemporary sociological theory has degenerated into pure critique, strongly influenced by Marxist dogmatism. Such thinking has a strong element of anti-American and anti-Western bias, in which all questions have one answer--the evil of capitalism--and all problems one solution--the good of socialism. In criminology, for instance, he shows that high crime rates are seen as an expression of capitalist disintegration, and criminal behavior a covert expression of radical action. Indeed, in one area after another, Horowitz shows how this same formulaic thinking dominates the field, resulting in a crude reductionist view of contemporary social life. At a time when the world is moving closer to the free market and democratic norms, he concludes, such reductionist tendencies and ideological posturings are outmoded. Horowitz offers an alternative. He urges a larger vision of the social sciences, one in which universities, granting agencies and research institutes provide an environment in which research may be untainted by partisan agencies--where policy choices will not be hindered by the prevailing cultural climate. He counsels sociologists to move away from blind advocacy, to meet the challenges of the twenty-first century by incorporating the knowledge of other times and places, and to take into account the shrinking globe--in short, to develop and maintain a new set of universal standards in this era of a world culture. Here then is an eloquent plea for a revolution in sociology, written by one of the field's foremost figures.

2583,327.0,"Do positive psychology interventions-that is, treatment methods or intentional activities aimed at cultivating positive feelings, positive behaviors, or positive cognitions-enhance well-being and ameliorate depressive symptoms? A meta-analysis of 51 such interventions with 4,266 individuals was conducted to address this question and to provide practical guidance to clinicians. The results revealed that positive psychology interventions do indeed significantly enhance well-being (mean r=.29) and decrease depressive symptoms (mean r=.31). In addition, several factors were found to impact the effectiveness of positive psychology interventions, including the depression status, self-selection, and age of participants, as well as the format and duration of the interventions. Accordingly, clinicians should be encouraged to incorporate positive psychology techniques into their clinical work, particularly for treating clients who are depressed, relatively older, or highly motivated to improve.

We propose that principles and techniques from the field of machine learning can help psychology become a more predictive science.

In conjunction with recent developments in history and philosophy of science, sociologists of science speak of the disunity of science and describe the local-historical origins of particular scientific facts and laws. Core sociology textbooks devote no attention to the methodological implications of recent sociology of science. Elementary textbooks present up-beat versions of the discipline that emphasize sociology's scientific methodology; they describe sociological methods as implementations of general research process designed along hypothetico-deductive lines. Viewed from the vantage point of SSK, such widely disseminated elementary versions of sociology promote an asociological conception of science.

2588,956.0,"There is no adequate definition of social problems within sociology, and there is not and never has been a sociology of social problems. That observation is the point of departure of this book. The authors aim to provide such a definition and to prepare the ground for the empirical study of social problems. They are aware that their objective will strike many fellow sociologists as ambitious, perhaps even arrogant. Their work challenges sociologists who have, over a period of fifty years, written treatises on social problems, produced textbooks cataloguing the nature, distribution, and causes of these problems, and taught many sociology courses. It is only natural that the authors' work will be viewed as controversial in light of the large literature which has established a ""sociology of"" a wide range of social problems-the sociology of race relations, prostitution, poverty, crime, mental illness, and so forth. In the 1970s when the authors were preparing for a seminar on the sociology of social problems, their review of the ""literature"" revealed the absence of any systematic, coherent statement of theory or method in the study of social problems. For many years the subject was listed and offered by university departments of sociology as a ""service course"" to present undergraduates with what they should know about the various ""social pathologies"" that exist in their society. This conception of social problems for several decades has been reflected in the substance and quality of the literature dominated by textbooks. In Constructing Social Problems, the authors propose that social problems be conceived as the claims-making activities of individuals or groups regarding social conditions they consider unjust, immoral, or harmful and that should be addressed. This perspective, as the authors have formulated it, conceives of social problems as a process of interaction that produces social problems as social facts in society. The authors further propose that this process and the social facts it produces are the data to be researched for the sociology of social problems.

I conclude by looking at the emergence of evolutionary psychology as our field matures into the 21st century.",Psychology

2595,180.0,"The possibility of explaining the positron and electron excess recently found by the PAMELA and ATIC collaborations in terms of dark matter (DM) annihilation has attracted considerable attention. Models surviving bounds from, e.g, antiproton production generally fall into two classes, where either DM annihilates directly with a large branching fraction into light leptons, or, as in the recent models of Arkani-Hamed et al., and of Nomura and Thaler, the annihilation gives low-mass (pseudo)scalars or vectors $\phi$ which then decay into $\mu^+\mu^-$ or $e^+e^-$. While the constraints on the first kind of models have recently been treated by several authors, we study here specifically models of the second type which rely on an efficient Sommerfeld enhancement in order to obtain the necessary boost in the annihilation cross section. We compute the photon flux generated by QED radiative corrections to the decay of $\phi$ and show that this indeed gives a rather spectacular broad peak in $E^2d\sigma/dE$, that for these extreme values of the cross section violate gamma-ray observations of the Galactic center for DM density profiles steeper than that of Navarro, Frenk and White. The most stringent constraint comes from the comparison of the predicted synchrotron radiation in the central part of the Galaxy with radio observations of Sgr A*. For the most commonly adopted DM profiles, the models that provide a good fit to the PAMELA and ATIC data are ruled out, unless there are physical processes that boost the local anti-matter fluxes more than one order of magnitude, while not affecting the gamma-ray or radio fluxes.",Astronomy
2596,466.0,"We have argued that the evolutionary perspective to social psychology is not untestable, not reductionist, not a theory about rigid genetic determinism, not a justification for the status quo, and not incompatible with sociocultural or cognitive analyses. What it is, instead, is a set of ideas that have proved quite useful in generating novel hypotheses, and parsimoniously connecting findings from very different domains ranging from mate choice and family relationships to aggression and intergroup relations. Adopting an evolutionary perspective can help us appreciate not only the common threads that bind the people in our culture to those in other cultures, but also, beyond that, to the other species with which we share the earth. Taking this broad perspective, however, also makes us aware of the vast reaches of our own ignorance. As yet, we know very little about how evolved psychological mechanisnis inside individuals develop, or how they influence, and are influenced by, the complex cultures that humans construct. Bringing light to these questions will require a fuller integration of all the different theoretical perspectives on human social behavior.",Psychology

The broaden-and-build theory posits that experiences of positive emotions broaden people's momentary thought-action repertoires, which in turn serves to build their enduring personal resources, ranging from physical and intellectual resources to social and psychological resources. Preliminary empirical evidence supporting the broaden-and-build theory is reviewed, and open empirical questions that remain to be tested are identified. The theory and findings suggest that the capacity to experience positive emotions may be a fundamental human strength central to the study of human flourishing.",Psychology
2598,256.0,"Context: Submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) are distant, dusty galaxies undergoing star formation at prodigious rates. Recently there has been major progress in understanding the nature of the bright SMGs (i.e. S(850um)&gt;5mJy). The samples for the fainter SMGs are small and are currently in a phase of being built up through identification studies. Aims: We study the molecular gas content in two SMGs, SMMJ163555 and SMMJ163541, at z=1.034 and z=3.187 with unlensed submm fluxes of 0.4mJy and 6.0mJy. Both SMGs are gravitationally lensed by the foreground cluster A2218. Methods: IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometry observations at 3mm were obtained for the lines CO(2-1) for SMMJ163555 and CO(3-2) for SMMJ163541. Additionally we obtained CO(4-3) for the candidate z=4.048 SMMJ163556 with an unlensed submm flux of 2.7mJy. Results: CO(2-1) was detected for SMMJ163555 at z=1.0313 with an integrated line intensity of 1.2+-0.2Jy km/s and a line width of 410+-120 km/s. From this a gas mass of 1.6x10^9 Msun is derived and a star formation efficiency of 440Lsun/Msun is estimated. CO(3-2) was detected for SMMJ163541 at z=3.1824, possibly with a second component at z=3.1883, with an integrated line intensity of 1.0+-0.1 Jy km/s and a line width of 280+-50 km/s. From this a gas mass of 2.2x10^10 Msun is derived and a star formation efficiency of 1000 Lsun/Msun is estimated. For SMMJ163556 the CO(4-3) is undetected within the redshift range 4.035-4.082 down to a sensitivity of 0.15 Jy km/s. Conclusions: Our CO line observations confirm the optical redshifts for SMMJ163555 and SMMJ163541. The CO line luminosity L'_CO for both galaxies is consistent with the L_FIR-L'_CO relation. SMMJ163555 has the lowest FIR luminosity of all SMGs with a known redshift and is one of the few high redshift LIRGs whose properties can be estimated prior to ALMA.",Astronomy
2599,139.0,"We present results obtained from near-infrared JHK spectroscopic observations of novae V2491 Cyg and V597 Pup in the early declining phases of their 2007 and 2008 outbursts respectively. In both objects, the spectra displayed emission lines of HI, OI, HeI and NI. In V597 Pup, the HeI lines were found to strengthen rapidly with time. Based on the observed spectral characteristics, both objects are classified as He/N novae. We have investigated the possibility of V2491 Cyg being a recurrent nova as has been suggested. By studying the temporal evolution of the line widths in V2491 Cyg it appears unlikely that the binary companion is a giant star with heavy wind as in recurrent novae of the RS Oph type. Significant deviations from that of recombination case B conditions are observed in the strengths of the HI lines. This indicates that the HI lines, in both novae, are optically thick during the span of our observations. The slope of the continuum spectra in both cases was found to have a \lambda^-(3-3.5) dependence which deviates from a Rayleigh-Jeans spectral distribution. Both novae were detected in the post-outburst super-soft X-ray phase; V2491 Cyg being very bright in X-rays has been the target of several observations. We discuss and correlate our infrared observations with the observed X-ray properties of these novae.",Astronomy

2604,70.0,"The ACS Survey of Galactic Globular Clusters is a Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Treasury program designed to provide a new large, deep and homogeneous photometric database. Based on observations from this program, we have measured precise relative ages for a sample of 64 Galactic globular clusters by comparing the relative position of the clusters' main sequence turn offs, using main-sequence fitting to cross-compare clusters within the sample. This method provides relative ages to a formal precision of 2-7%. We demonstrate that the calculated relative ages are independent of the choice of theoretical model. We find that the Galactic globular cluster sample can be divided into two groups -- a population of old clusters with an age dispersion of ~5% and no age-metallicity relation, and a group of younger clusters with an age-metallicity relation similar to that of the globular clusters associated with the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy. These results are consistent with the Milky Way halo having formed in two phases or processes. The first one would be compatible with a rapid (&lt;0.8 Gyr) assembling process of the halo, in which the clusters in the old group were formed. Also these clusters could have been formed before reionization in dwarf galaxies that would later merge to build the Milky Way halo as predicted by Lambda-CDM cosmology. However, the galactocentric metallicity gradient shown by these clusters seems difficult to reconcile with the latter. As for the younger clusters, it is very tempting to argue that their origin is related to their formation within Milky Way satellite galaxies that were later accreted, but the origin of the age-metallicity relation remains unclear.",Astronomy
2605,451.0,"Traditional theories of forgetting are wedded to the notion that cue-overload interference procedures (often involving the A-B, A-C list-learning paradigm) capture the most important elements of forgetting in everyday life. However, findings from a century of work in psychology, psychopharmacology, and neuroscience converge on the notion that such procedures may pertain mainly to forgetting in the laboratory and that everyday forgetting is attributable to an altogether different form of interference. According to this idea, recently formed memories that have not yet had a chance to consolidate are vulnerable to the interfering force of mental activity and memory formation (even if the interfering activity is not similar to the previously learned material). This account helps to explain why sleep, alcohol, and benzodiazepines all improve memory for a recently learned list, and it is consistent with recent work on the variables that affect the induction and maintenance of long-term potentiation in the hippocampus.",Psychology

2611,694.0,"This paper describes a qualitative study of how people use their time at work, why they use it this way, and whether their way of using time is optimal for them or their work groups. Results of a nine-month field study of the work practices of a software engineering team revealed that the group's collective use of time perpetuated its members' “time famine,” a feeling of having too much to do and not enough time to do it. Engineers had difficulty getting their individual work done because they were constantly interrupted by others. A crisis mentality and a reward system based on individual heroics perpetuated this disruptive way of interacting. Altering the way software engineers used their time at work, however, enhanced their collective productivity. This research points toward a “sociology of work time,” a framework integrating individuals' interdependent work patterns and the larger social and temporal contexts. The theoretical and practical implications of a sociology of work time are explored.",Sociology

We aim to provide a picture as wide and complete as possible of the problem of measuring the distance of microquasars in our Galaxy. The purpose of this work is to fairly and critically review in great detail every distance method used for these two microquasars in order to show that the distances of probably all microquasars in our galaxy are much more uncertain than currently admitted. Moreover, we show that many confirmations of quantitative results are often entangled and rely on very uncertain measurements. We also present a new determination of the maximum distance of GRO J1655-40 using red clump giant stars, and show that it confirms our earlier result of a distance less than 2 kpc instead of 3.2 kpc. Since it then becomes more likely that GRO J1655-40 could originate from the stellar cluster NGC 6242, located at 1.0 kpc, we review the distance estimations of A0620-00, which is so far the closest black hole with an average distance of about 1.0 kpc. We show that the distance methods used for A0620-00 are also problematic. Finally, we present a new analysis of spectroscopic and astrometric archival data on this microquasar, and apply the maximum-distance method of Foellmi et al. (2006). It appears that A0620-00 could indeed be even closer to the Sun than currently estimated, and consequently would be the closest known black hole to the Sun.",Astronomy

Systematic psychological research on the nature and effects of work groups dates back at least to the Hawthorne studies of the 1920s and 1930s.

The authors review the evolution of team research over the past century with a particular focus on that which has appeared in this journal. They chronicle the shift from a focus on individuals within teams, or on individual versus team comparisons, to a focus on the team itself and larger systems of teams. They describe the major outcomes studied within this literature, and how they relate to the nature of team tasks and structures. Further, the authors consider the roles of team members' characteristics and composition, and team dynamics in terms of processes and emergent states.

Taking in the cultural, political and economic dimensions of globalization, the book provides a thorough introduction to key debates and critically evaluates the causes and consequences of a globalizing world. In addition to topics such as America's changing position in the world under President Obama, the growth of China as a global power and anti-globalization movements, Martell brings to the discussion other aspects of world affairs that sociologists have sometimes not focused on so much. In doing so, he underlines the importance of economic motivations and structures, and shows how power, inequality and conflict are major factors in globalization. The book argues that globalization offers many opportunities for greater interaction and participation in societies throughout the world, for instance through the media and migration, but also has dark sides such as war and nuclear proliferation, global poverty, climate change and financial crisis. This book will be an ideal companion to students across the social sciences taking courses that cover globalization, and the sociology of globalization in particular.",Sociology

2617,51.0,"Most gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) observed by the Swift satellite show an early rapid decay phase (RDP) in their X-ray lightcurve, which is usually a smooth continuation of the prompt gamma-ray emission, strongly suggesting that it is its tail. However, the mechanism behind it is still not clear. The most popular model for this RDP is High Latitude Emission (HLE). While HLE is expected in many models for the prompt GRB emission, such as the popular internal shocks model, there are models in which it is not expected, such as sporadic magnetic reconnection events. Therefore, testing whether the RDP is consistent with HLE can help distinguish between different prompt emission models. We address this question by modeling the prompt emission as the sum of its individual pulses with their HLE tails. Analytic expressions for the observed flux density are obtained for power-law and Band function emission spectra. For internal shocks the observed instantaneous spectrum is very close to the emitted one, and should be well described by a Band function also during the RDP. Our model naturally produces, the observed spectral softening and steepening of the flux decay. The observed flux during the RDP is initially dominated by the tail of the last pulse, but the tails of one or more earlier pulses can become dominant later on. Moreover, modeling several overlapping pulses as a single wider pulse would over-predict the emission tail. Thus, one should be very careful when testing the predictions of HLE and do a combined temporal and spectral fit of the prompt GRB emission and the RDP.",Astronomy

2620,12.0,"Our ability to determine stellar ages from measurements of stellar rotation, hinges on how well we can measure the dependence of rotation on age for stars of different masses. Rotation periods for stars in open clusters are essential to determine the relations between stellar age, rotation, and mass (color). Until recently, ambiguities in vsini data and lack of cluster membership information, prevented a clear empirical definition of the dependence of rotation on color. Direct measurements of stellar rotation periods for members in young clusters have now revealed a well-defined period-color relation. We show new results for the open clusters M35 and M34. However, rotation periods based on ground-based observations are limited to young clusters. The Hyades represent the oldest coeval population of stars with measured rotation periods.

2621,658.0,"Throughout the world, culture has been doggedly pushing its way onto the center stage of debates not only in sociological theory and research but also throughout the human sciences. As with any profound intellectual shift, this has been a process characterized by leads and lags. In the UK, for example, culture has been making headway since the early 1970s. In the USA, the tide began to turn unmistakably only in the mid-1980s. In continental Europe, it is possible to argue that culture never really went away. Despite this ongoing revival of interest, however, there is anything but consensus among sociologists specializing in the area about just what the concept means and how it relates to the discipline as traditionally understood. These differences of opinion can be usefully explained only partly as empirical reflections of geographical, sociopolitical, or national traditions. More importantly, they are manifestations of deeper contradictions relating to axiomatic and foundational logics in the theory of culture. Pivotal to all these disputes is the issue of ‘cultural autonomy’ (Alexander l990, Smith 1998a). In this paper, we employ the concept of cultural autonomy to explore and evaluate the competing understandings of culture currently available to social theory. We suggest that fundamental flaws characterize most of these models, and we argue for an alternative approach that can be broadly understood as a kind of structural hermeneutics.",Sociology

This is illustrated with an agent‐based model of mutual social influence on domestic water demand. The consequences for many frequently used statistical techniques are discussed.",Sociology
2623,946.0,"The concept of stigma, denoting relations of shame, has a long ancestry and has from the earliest times been associated with deviations from the 'normal', including, in various times and places, deviations from normative prescriptions of acceptable states of being for self and others. This paper dwells on modern social formations and offers conceptual and theoretical pointers towards a more convincing contemporary sociology of health-related stigma. It starts with an appreciation and critique of Goffman's benchmark sensitisation and traces his influence on the personal tragedy or deviance paradigm dominant in the medical sociology from the 1970s. To allow for the development of an argument, the focus here is on specific types of disorder--principally, epilepsy and HIV--rather than the research literature as a whole. Brief and critical consideration is given to attempts to operationalise or otherwise 'measure' health-related stigma. The advocacy of a rival oppression paradigm by disability theorists from the 1980s, notably through re-workings of the social model of disability, is addressed. It is suggested that we are now in a position to learn and move on from this paradigm 'clash'. A re-framing of notions of relations of stigma, signalling shame, and relations of deviance, signalling blame, is proposed. This framework, and the positing of a variable and changing dynamic between cultural norms of shame and blame--always embedded in social structures of class, command, gender, ethnicity and so on--is utilised to explore recent approaches to health stigma reduction programmes.",Sociology

2628,245.0,"A four-dimensional statistical description of electromagnetic radiation is developed and applied to the analysis of radio pulsar polarization. The new formalism provides an elementary statistical explanation of the modal broadening phenomenon in single pulse observations. It is also used to argue that the degree of polarization of giant pulses has been poorly defined in past studies. Single and giant pulse polarimetry typically involves sources with large flux densities and observations with high time resolution, factors that necessitate consideration of source-intrinsic noise and small-number statistics. Self noise is shown to fully explain the excess polarization dispersion previously noted in single pulse observations of bright pulsars, obviating the need for additional randomly polarized radiation. Rather, these observations are more simply interpreted as an incoherent sum of covariant, orthogonal, partially polarized modes. Based on this premise, the four-dimensional covariance matrix of the Stokes parameters may be used to derive mode-separated pulse profiles without any assumptions about the intrinsic degrees of mode polarization. Finally, utilizing the small-number statistics of the Stokes parameters, it is established that the degree of polarization of an unresolved pulse is fundamentally undefined; therefore, previous claims of highly polarized giant pulses are unsubstantiated.

Recent texts have chronicled economic sociology's nineteenth-century origins while pointing to the importance of context and power in economic life, yet the field lacks a clear understanding of the role that concepts at different levels of abstraction play in its organization. Economic Sociology fills this critical gap by surveying the current state of the field while advancing a framework for further theoretical development. Alejandro Portes examines economic sociology's principal assumptions, key explanatory concepts, and selected research sites. He argues that economic activity is embedded in social and cultural relations, but also that power and the unintended consequences of rational purposive action must be factored in when seeking to explain or predict economic behavior. Drawing upon a wealth of examples, Portes identifies three strategic sites of research--the informal economy, ethnic enclaves, and transnational communities--and he eschews grand narratives in favor of mid-range theories that help us understand specific kinds of social action. The book shows how the meta-assumptions of economic sociology can be transformed, under certain conditions, into testable propositions, and puts forward a theoretical agenda aimed at moving the field out of its present impasse.",Sociology
2630,450.0,"Five studies explored cognitive, affective, and behavioral responses to proscribed forms of social cognition. Experiments 1 and 2 revealed that people responded to taboo trade-offs that monetized sacred values with moral outrage and cleansing. Experiments 3 and 4 revealed that racial egalitarians were least likely to use, and angriest at those who did use, race-tainted base rates and that egalitarians who inadvertently used such base rates tried to reaffirm their fair-mindedness. Experiment 5 revealed that Christian fundamentalists were most likely to reject heretical counterfactuals that applied everyday causal schemata to Biblical narratives and to engage in moral cleansing after merely contemplating such possibilities. Although the results fit the sacred-value-protection model (SVPM) better than rival formulations, the SVPM must draw on cross-cultural taxonomies of relational schemata to specify normative boundaries on thought.",Psychology

2632,581.0,"Four basic models in personality research (trait psychology, psychodynamics, situationism, and interactionsim) are reviewed and compared with respect to (a) types of laws sought, (b) determinants of behavior, (c) units of analysis, (d) the consistency vs specificity issue, (e) ontogenetic development of behavior, and (f) research strategies and populations sampled. An analysis of the controversy between the trait model and the interactional model suggests that the trait model is limited as a basis for use in description and prediction of behavior and as a general basis for personality research. Empirical results support an interactional view of behavior, in which actual behavior is determined by a continuous and multidirectional interaction between person variables and situation variables. The issues and research on situational determinants of behavior are reviewed, and the need for more systematic psychological studies of situations is stressed. Major features of the interactional model of personality are discussed, and the necessity of developing methods for investigating continuous interaction processes is emphasized.

We find that the hemispherical power asymmetry previously reported for the largest scales l=2-40 extend to much smaller scales. In fact, for the full multipole range l=2-600, significantly more power is found in the hemisphere centered at (theta=107 deg., phi=226 deg.) in galactic co-latitude and longitude than in the opposite hemisphere consistent with the previously detected direction of asymmetry for l=2-40. We adopt a model selection test where the direction and amplitude of asymmetry as well as the multipole range are free parameters. A model with an asymmetric distribution of power for l=2-600 is found to be preferred over the isotropic model at the 0.4% significance level taking into account the additional parameters required to describe it. A similar direction of asymmetry is found independently in all six subranges of 100 multipoles between l=2-600 and none of our 9800 isotropic simulated maps show a similarly consistent direction of asymmetry over such a large multipole range.

This article reviews research on a selection of trends brought on by the climate crisis: ( a) compounding and cumulative disasters, infrastructure breakdown, and adaptation; ( b) intensifying migration and shifting patterns of settlement; and ( c) transformations in consumption, labor, and energy. While climate change's far-reaching implications remain peripheral to the discipline at large, sociologists studying these trends increasingly understand the crisis as a central problem for the study of social life. We show how sociologists can shed light on core problems emerging from and contributing to the crisis, and also reveal the conditions that make necessary social and cultural transformations more likely. Throughout, we illuminate how sociology can help chart a path out of the climate crisis by identifying alternatives to the high-carbon, low-equity social structures that organize the modern world. Finally, we identify possibilities for scholars who do not see themselves as “environmental sociologists” to contribute meaningful research on the climate crisis, and we encourage them to do so while we can make a difference.",Sociology
2635,49.0,"A new semianalytical model that explains the formation and sizes of the 'great walls' - the largest structures observed in the universe is suggested. Although the basis of the model is the Zel'dovich approximation it has been used in a new way very different from the previous studies. Instead of traditional approach that evaluates the nonlinear density field it has been utilized for identification of the regions in Lagrangian space that after the mapping to real or redshift space (depending on the kind of structure is studied) end up in the regions where shell-crossing occurs. The set of these regions in Lagrangian space form the progenitor of the structure and after the mapping it determines the pattern of the structure in real or redshift space. The particle trajectories have crossed in such regions and the mapping is no longer unique there. The progenitor after mapping makes only one stream in the multi-stream flow regions therefore it does not comprise all the mass. Nevertheless, it approximately retains the shape of the structure. The progenitor of the structure in redshift space depends on a few non-Gaussian fields and also it is strongly affected by two anisotropic fields that determine the pattern of great walls as well as their huge sizes. All the fields used in the mappings are derived from the linear potential smoothed at the current scale of nonlinearity which is $R_{nl} = 2.7$ {\hmpc} for the adopted parameters of the \lcdm universe normalized to $\sigma_8 = 0.8$. The model predicts the existence of walls with sizes significantly greater than 500 {\hmpc} that may be found in sufficiently large redshift surveys.",Astronomy
2636,756.0,Humans are inexorably driven to search for order and meaning in their own and others' lives; accounts are a major avenue for sociologists to depict and understand the ways in which individuals experience and identify with that meaning and their social world. The accounts concept has a solid foundation and history in early sociological analysis and research. The current work on accounts focuses on “story-like” interpretations or explanations and their functions and consequences to a social actor's life. The concept is useful for gaining insight into the human experience and arriving at meanings or culturally embedded normative explanations. This concept deserves greater explicit attention in sociology and is in need of further theoretical development and stimulation. I argue that sociologists should embrace the concept of accounts; the foundation is set for a resurgence of work on accounts in sociology.,Sociology

2638,145.0,"We report an analysis of photometric behaviour of DI UMa, an extremely active dwarf nova. The observational campaign (completed in 2007) covers five superoutbursts and four normal outbursts. We examined principal parameters of the system to understand peculiarities of DI UMa, and other active cataclysmic variables. Based on precise photometric measurements, temporal light curve behaviour, O-C analysis, and power spectrum analysis, we investigated physical parameters of the system. We found that the period of the supercycle now equals 31.45 +/-0.3 days. Observations during superoutbursts infer that the period of superhumps equals P_sh = 0.055318(11) days (79.66 +/- 0.02 min). During quiescence, the light curve reveals a modulation of period P_orb = 0.054579(6) days (78.59 +/- 0.01 min), which we interpret as the orbital period of the binary system. The values obtained allowed us to determine a fractional period excess of 1.35% +/- 0.02%, which is surprisingly small compared to the usual value for dwarf novae (2%-5%). A detailed O-C analysis was performed for two superoutbursts with the most comprehensive coverage. In both cases, we detected an increase in the superhump period with a mean rate of dot_P/P_sh = 4.4(1.0)*10^{-5}. Based on these measurements, we confirm that DI UMa is probably a period bouncer, an old system that reached its period minimum a long time ago, has a secondary that became a degenerate brown dwarf, the entire system evolving now toward longer periods. DI UMa is an extremely interesting object because we know only one more active ER UMa star with similar characteristics (IX Dra).",Astronomy

The second solar spectrum is the observational signature of radiatively induced quantum coherences in the atoms and molecules of the solar atmosphere. Magnetic fields produce partial decoherence via the Hanle effect, giving rise to fascinating observable effects in the emergent spectral line polarization. Interestingly, these effects allow us to ""see"" magnetic fields to which the Zeeman effect is blind within the limitations of the available instrumentation. In the coming years, the physical interpretation of observations of the spectral line polarization resulting from the joint action of the Hanle and Zeeman effects might lead to a new revolution in our empirical understanding of solar magnetic fields.",Astronomy
2640,32.0,"Magnetospheres of neutron stars are anchored in the rigid crust and can be twisted by sudden crustal motions (""starquakes""). The twisted magnetosphere does not remain static and gradually untwists, dissipating magnetic energy and producing radiation. The equation describing this evolution is derived, and its solutions are presented. Two distinct regions coexist in untwisting magnetospheres: a potential region where curl(B)=0 (""cavity"") and a current-carrying bundle of field lines (""j-bundle""). The cavity has a sharp boundary, which expands with time and eventually erases all of the twist. In this process, the electric current of the j-bundle is sucked into the star. Observational appearance of the untwisting process is discussed. A hot spot forms at the footprints of the j-bundle. The spot shrinks with time toward the magnetic dipole axis, and its luminosity and temperature gradually decrease. As the j-bundle shrinks, the amplitude of its twist can grow to the maximum possible value ~ 1. The strong twist near the dipole axis increases the spindown rate of the star and can generate a broad beam of radio emission. The model explains the puzzling behavior of magnetar XTE J1810-197 -- a canonical example of magnetospheric evolution following a starquake. We also discuss implications for other magnetars. The untwisting theory suggests that the nonthermal radiation of magnetars is preferentially generated on a bundle of extended closed field lines near the dipole axis.",Astronomy

Our central finding is that in systems with certain space-time symmetries, quantum coherence manifests itself in the form of new spectral solutions for the dynamical 2-point correlation function. This spectral structure leads to a consistent approximation for dynamical equations that describe coherent evolution in presence of decohering collisions. We illustrate the method by solving the bosonic Klein problem and the bound states for the nonrelativistic square well potential. We then compare our spectral phase space definition of particle number to other definitions in the nonequilibrium field theory.

Combining FUV and NUV spectra of PKS0312-77 with optical observations of galaxies in the surrounding field (15'x32'), we present an analysis of these absorbers and their connection to galaxies. The observed OI/HI ratio and photoionization modelling of other low ions indicate the metallicity of the LLS is [Z/H]_LLS=-0.6 and that the LLS is nearly 100% photoionized. In contrast, the OVI-bearing gas is collisionally ionized at T~(3-10)x10^5 K as derived from the high-ion ratios and profile broadenings.

Its main purpose is to show how psychology can be done differently'. From a standpoint which views knowledge as produced and reproduced within specific historical conditions and power relations, Wendy Hollway criticizes the almost intentional blindness of psychology to its own conditions of production'. She describes her own method in her research on subjectivity and gender difference as well as the subjective, cultural and theoretical conditions within which it was developed. She outlines a theory of how meaning is achieved within discourses and discusses how the theory can be used to understand and analyse accounts and their production. She explains how her theory helped her to understand the production and reproduction of gender difference in adult relations. Then, using a framework which connects psychodynamic processes, power relations and gender-differentiated positions, she analyses the production of a range of mainstream psychologies. Central to the book is a radical reappraisal of the concept of subjectivity and its use as a tool for psychological understanding. The author concludes with an analysis of the way in which gender difference and subjectivity are involved in dominant conceptions of psychology as a science. She explores the implications of this analysis for feminist psychology and other psychologies with emancipatory goals.

What is personal growth? Under what conditions is it possible? How can one person help another? What is creativity, and how can it be fostered? These are some of the issues raised, which challenge many concepts of traditional psychology. Contemporary psychology derives largely from the experimental laboratory, or from Freudian theory. It is preoccupied with minute aspects of animal and human behaviour, or with the mentally ill. But there are rebels, of whom the author counts himself as one, along with Gordon Allport, Abraham Maslow and Rollo May, who feel that psychology and psychiatry should be aiming higher, and be more concerned with growth and potentiality in man. The interest of such a psychology is in the production of harmoniously mature individuals, given that we all have qualities and possibilities infinitely capable of development. Successful development makes us more flexible in relationships, more creative, and less open to suggestion and control.

Restricting ourselves to quasi-circular orbits, we integrate the linear momentum flux over time to obtain the recoil velocity as function of orbital frequency. We find that in the so-called superkick configuration the higher-order spin corrections can increase the recoil velocity up to about a factor 3 with respect to the leading-order PN prediction. Furthermore, we provide expressions valid for generic orbits, and accurate at 2PN order, for the energy and angular momentum carried by gravitational waves emitted from spinning binary black holes.

A model of a 6.5 solar masses star of solar metallicity can simultaneously match the abundances of 26Al, 41Ca, 60Fe, and 107Pd inferred to have been present in the solar nebula by using a dilution factor of 1 part of AGB material per 300 parts of original solar nebula material, and taking into account a time interval between injection of the short-lived nuclides and consolidation of the first meteorites equal to 0.53 Myr. Such a polluting source does not overproduce 53Mn, as supernova models do, and only marginally affects isotopic ratios of stable elements.

2663,240.0,"Recently, there are two hints arising from physics beyond the standard model. One is a possible energy loss mechanism due to emission of very weakly interacting light particles from white dwarf stars, with a coupling strength ~ 0.7x10^{-13}, and another is the high energy positrons observed by the PAMELA satellite experiment. We construct a supersymmetric flipped-SU(5) model, SU(5)xU(1)_X with appropriate additional symmetries, [U(1)_H]_{gauge}x[U(1)_RxU(1)_\Gamma]_{global}xZ_2, such that these are explained by a very light electrophilic axion of mass 0.5 meV from the spontaneously broken U(1)_\Gamma and two component cold dark matters from Z_2 parity. We show that in the flipped-SU(5) there exists a basic mechanism for allowing excess positrons through the charged SU(2) singlet leptons, but not allowing anti-proton excess due to the absence of the SU(2) singlet quarks. We show the discovery potential of the charged SU(2) singlet E at the LHC experiments by observing the electron and positron spectrum. With these symmetries, we also comment on the mass hierarchy between the top and bottom quarks.",Astronomy
2664,47.0,"Within the context of standard cosmology, an accelerating universe requires the presence of a third `dark' component of energy, beyond matter and radiation. The available data, however, are still deemed insufficient to distinguish between an evolving dark energy component and the simplest model of a time-independent cosmological constant. In this paper, we examine the cosmological expansion in terms of observer-dependent coordinates, in addition to the more conventional co-moving coordinates. This procedure explicitly reveals the role played by the radius R_h of our cosmic horizon in the interrogation of the data. (In Rindler's notation, R_h coincides with the `event horizon' in the case of de Sitter, but changes in time for other cosmologies that also contain matter and/or radiation.) With this approach, we show that the interpretation of dark energy as a cosmological constant is clearly disfavored by the observations. Within the framework of standard Friedman-Robertson-Walker cosmology, we derive an equation describing the evolution of R_h, and solve it using the WMAP and Type Ia supernova data. In particular, we consider the meaning of the observed equality (or near equality) R_h(t_0) ~ ct_0, where t_0 is the age of the Universe. This empirical result is far from trivial, for a cosmological constant would drive R_h(t) towards ct (where t is the cosmic time) only once--and that would have to occur right now. Though we are not here espousing any particular alternative model of dark energy, for comparison we also consider scenarios in which dark energy is given by scaling solutions, which simultaneously eliminate several conundrums in the standard model, including the `coincidence' and `flatness' problems, and account very well for the fact that R_h(t_0) ~ ct_0.",Astronomy

2666,746.0,"Outline of a Theory of Practice is recognized as a major theoretical text on the foundations of anthropology and sociology. Pierre Bourdieu, a distinguished French anthropologist, develops a theory of practice which is simultaneously a critique of the methods and postures of social science and a general account of how human action should be understood. With his central concept of the habitus, the principle which negotiates between objective structures and practices, Bourdieu is able to transcend the dichotomies which have shaped theoretical thinking about the social world. The author draws on his fieldwork in Kabylia (Algeria) to illustrate his theoretical propositions. With detailed study of matrimonial strategies and the role of rite and myth, he analyses the dialectical process of the 'incorporation of structures' and the objectification of habitus, whereby social formations tend to reproduce themselves. A rigorous consistent materialist approach lays the foundations for a theory of symbolic capital and, through analysis of the different modes of domination, a theory of symbolic power.",Sociology

K and H2 1-0S(1) images of a contiguous 8 sqr degree region are compared to photometry from Spitzer and dust-continuum maps obtained with MAMBO and SCUBA. We also measure proper motions for H2 features in 33 outflows. We increase the number of known H2 outflows in Orion A to 116. A total of 111 H2 flows were observed with Spitzer; outflow sources are identified for at least 72 of them. The MAMBO 1200 micron maps cover 97 H2 flows; 57 of them are associated with Spitzer sources and dust cores or extended emission. The H2 jets are widely distributed and randomly orientated; the jets do not appear to be orthogonal to large-scale filaments or even to the small-scale cores. Moreover, H2 jet lengths and opening angles are not obviously correlated with indicators of outflow source age - source spectral index or (sub)millimetre core flux. We demonstrate that H2 jet sources are predominantly protostellar with flat or positive spectral indices, rather than disk-excess (or T Tauri) stars. Most protostars in molecular cores drive H2 outflows. However, not all molecular cores are associated with protostars or H2 jets. On statistical grounds, the H2 jet phase may be marginally shorter than the protostellar phase, though must be considerably shorter than the prestellar phase. In terms of their spectral index, H2 jet sources are indistinguishable from protostars. The few true protostars without H2 jets are almost certainly more evolved than their H2-jet-driving counterparts. We also find that protostars that power molecular outflows are no more (nor no less) clustered than protostars that do not. The H2 emission regions in outflows from young stars clearly weaken and fade very quickly, before the source evolves from protostar to pre-main-sequence star.",Astronomy

2672,48.0,"AIMS: For six neutron-star atoll sources (4U 1608-52, 4U 1636-53, 4U 0614+09, 4U 1728-34, 4U 1820-30 and 4U 1735-44) we investigate the relationship between the observed fractional rms amplitudes of the twin kHz QPOs. We discuss whether this displays features that could have a physical meaning in terms of the proposed QPO models. METHOD: We consider the difference in rms amplitude between the upper and lower kHz QPOs, as a function of the frequency ratio R. We compare two data sets. Set I is a collection taken from published data. Set II has rms amplitude values obtained by automatic fitting of continuous segments of RXTE-PCA observations. RESULTS: For each of the six sources, we find that there is a point in the R domain around which the amplitudes of the two twin kHz QPOs are the same. We find such a point located inside a narrow interval R=1.5 +-3%. Further investigation is needed in the case of two sources to explore this finding, since we have not determined this point in Set II. There is evidence of a similar point close to R = 1.33 or R = 1.25 in the four sources. We suggest that some of these points may correspond to the documented clustering of the twin kHz QPO frequency ratios. CONCLUSIONS: For the sources studied, the rms amplitudes of the two kHz peaks become equal when the frequencies of the oscillations pass through a certain ratio R, which is roughly the same for each of the sources. In terms of the orbital QPO models, with some assumptions concerning the QPO modulation, this finding implies the existence of a specific orbit at a common value of the dimensionless radius, at which the oscillations corresponding to the two peaks come into balance. In a more general context, the amplitude difference behaviour suggests the possible existence of an energy interchange between the upper and lower QPO modes.",Astronomy
2673,84.0,"High-frequency twin peak quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) are observed in four microquasars, i.e., Galactic black hole binary systems, with frequency ratio very close to 3:2. In the microquasar GRS 1915+105, the structure of QPOs exhibits additional frequencies, and more than two frequencies are observed in the Galaxy nuclei Sgr A*, or in some extragalactic sources (NGC 4051, MCG-6-30-15 and NGC 5408 X-1). The observed QPOs can be explained by a variety of the orbital resonance model versions assuming resonance of oscillations with the Keplerian frequency or the vertical epicyclic frequency, and the radial epicyclic frequency, or some combinations of these frequencies. Generally, different resonances could arise at different radii of an accretion disc. However, we have shown that for special values of dimensionless black hole spin strong resonant phenomena could occur when different resonances can be excited at the same radius, as cooperative phenomena between the resonances may work in such situations. The special values of black hole spin are determined for triple frequency ratio sets \nu_{K} : \nu_{\theta} : \nu_{r} = s:t:u with s, t, u being small integers. The most promising example of such a special situation arises for black holes with extraordinary resonant spin a = 0.983 at the radius r = 2.395 M, where \nu_{K} : \nu_{\theta} : \nu_{r} = 3:2:1. We also predict that when combinations of the orbital frequencies are allowed, QPOs with four frequency ratio set 4:3:2:1 could be observed in the field of black holes with a = 0.866, 0.882 and 0.962. Assuming the extraordinary resonant spin a = 0.983 in Sgr A*, its QPOs with observed frequency ratio very close to 3:2:1 imply the black hole mass in the interval 4.3 x 10^6 M_sun &lt; M &lt; 5.4 x 10^6 M_sun, in agreement with estimates given by other, independent, observations.",Astronomy

2675,215.0,"PAHs have been detected toward molecular clouds and some young stars with disks, but have not yet been associated with embedded young stars. We present a sensitive mid-IR spectroscopic survey of PAH features toward a sample of low-mass embedded YSOs. The aim is to put constraints on the PAH abundance in the embedded phase of star formation using radiative transfer modeling. VLT-ISAAC L-band spectra for 39 sources and Spitzer IRS spectra for 53 sources are presented. Line intensities are compared to recent surveys of Herbig Ae/Be and T Tauri stars. The radiative transfer codes RADMC and RADICAL are used to model the PAH emission from embedded YSOs consisting of a PMS star with a circumstellar disk embedded in an envelope. The dependence of the PAH feature on PAH abundance, stellar radiation field, inclination and the extinction by the surrounding envelope is studied. The 3.3 micron PAH feature is undetected for the majority of the sample (97%), with typical upper limits of 5E-16 W/m^2. Compact 11.2 micron PAH emission is seen directly towards 1 out of the 53 Spitzer Short-High spectra, for a source that is borderline embedded. For all 12 sources with both VLT and Spitzer spectra, no PAH features are detected in either. In total, PAH features are detected toward at most 1 out of 63 (candidate) embedded protostars (&lt;~ 2%), even lower than observed for class II T Tauri stars with disks (11-14%). Assuming typical class I stellar and envelope parameters, the absence of PAHs emission is most likely explained by the absence of emitting carriers through a PAH abundance at least an order of magnitude lower than in molecular clouds but similar to that found in disks. Thus, most PAHs likely enter the protoplanetary disks frozen out in icy layers on dust grains and/or in coagulated form.",Astronomy
2676,649.0,"Gaslighting—a type of psychological abuse aimed at making victims seem or feel “crazy,” creating a “surreal” interpersonal environment—has captured public attention. Despite the popularity of the term, sociologists have ignored gaslighting, leaving it to be theorized by psychologists. However, this article argues that gaslighting is primarily a sociological rather than a psychological phenomenon. Gaslighting should be understood as rooted in social inequalities, including gender, and executed in power-laden intimate relationships. The theory developed here argues that gaslighting is consequential when perpetrators mobilize gender-based stereotypes and structural and institutional inequalities against victims to manipulate their realities. Using domestic violence as a strategic case study to identify the mechanisms via which gaslighting operates, I reveal how abusers mobilize gendered stereotypes; structural vulnerabilities related to race, nationality, and sexuality; and institutional inequalities against victims to erode their realities. These tactics are gendered in that they rely on the association of femininity with irrationality. Gaslighting offers an opportunity for sociologists to theorize under-recognized, gendered forms of power and their mobilization in interpersonal relationships.",Sociology
2677,670.0,"Though mainstream sociological theory has been founded within dualisms such as structure/agency, nature/culture, and mind/matter, a thread within sociology dating back to Spencer and Tarde favoured a monist ontology that cut across such dualistic categories. This thread has been reinvigorated by recent developments in social theory, including the new materialisms, posthumanism and affect theories. Here we assess what a monist or ‘flat’ ontology means for sociological understanding of key concepts such as structures and systems, power and resistance. We examine two monistic sociologies: Bruno Latour’s ‘sociology of associations’ and DeLanda’s ontology of assemblages. Understandings of social processes in terms of structures, systems or mechanisms are replaced with a focus upon the micropolitics of events and interactions. Power is a flux of forces or ‘affects’ fully immanent within events, while resistance is similarly an affective flow in events producing micropolitical effects contrary to power or control.",Sociology
2678,530.0,"Causal inference is of central importance to developmental psychology. Many key questions in the field revolve around improving the lives of children and their families. These include identifying risk factors that if manipulated in some way would foster child development. Such a task inherently involves causal inference: One wants to know whether the risk factor actually causes outcomes. Random assignment is not possible in many instances, and for that reason, psychologists must rely on observational studies. Such studies identify associations, and causal interpretation of such associations requires additional assumptions. Research in developmental psychology generally has relied on various forms of linear regression, but this methodology has limitations for causal inference. Fortunately, methodological developments in various fields are providing new tools for causal inference-tools that rely on more plausible assumptions. This article describes the limitations of regression for causal inference and describes how new tools might offer better causal inference. This discussion highlights the importance of properly identifying covariates to include (and exclude) from the analysis. This discussion considers the directed acyclic graph for use in accomplishing this task. With the proper covariates having been chosen, many of the available methods rely on the assumption of ""ignorability.""

While such shear flows have long been observed in the solar atmosphere, until recently, there was no compelling physical explanation for them. This paper will discuss the discovery that such shear flows are readily explained as a response to the Lorentz force that naturally occurs as bipolar magnetic fields emerge and expand in a gravitationally stratified atmosphere. It will be shown that shearing motions transport axial flux, and magnetic energy from the submerged portion of the field to the expanding portion, strongly coupling the solar interior to the corona. This physical process explains active region shear flows and why the magnetic field is found to be nearly parallel to photospheric polarity inversion lines where prominences form. Finally, shear flows driven by the Lorentz force are shown to produce a loss of equilibrium and eruption in magnetic arcades and flux ropes offering a convincing explanation for CMEs and flares.",Astronomy

2681,615.0,"Human beings, like other organisms, are the products of evolution. Like other organisms, we exhibit traits that are the product of natural selection. Our psychological capacities are evolved traits as much as are our gait and posture. This much few would dispute. Evolutionary psychology goes further than this, claiming that our psychological traits -- including a wide variety of traits, from mate preference and jealousy to language and reason -- can be understood as specific adaptations to ancestral Pleistocene conditions. In Evolutionary Psychology as Maladapted Psychology, Robert Richardson takes a critical look at evolutionary psychology by subjecting its ambitious and controversial claims to the same sorts of methodological and evidential constraints that are broadly accepted within evolutionary biology. The claims of evolutionary psychology may pass muster as psychology; but what are their evolutionary credentials? Richardson considers three ways adaptive hypotheses can be evaluated, using examples from the biological literature to illustrate what sorts of evidence and methodology would be necessary to establish specific evolutionary and adaptive explanations of human psychological traits. He shows that existing explanations within evolutionary psychology fall woefully short of accepted biological standards. The theories offered by evolutionary psychologists may identify traits that are, or were, beneficial to humans. But gauged by biological standards, there is inadequate evidence: evolutionary psychologists are largely silent on the evolutionary evidence relevant to assessing their claims, including such matters as variation in ancestral populations, heritability, and the advantage offered to our ancestors. As evolutionary claims they are unsubstantiated. Evolutionary psychology, Richardson concludes, may offer a program of research, but it lacks the kind of evidence that is generally expected within evolutionary biology.

In turn, the circumscribed flow of information within these spaces contributes to the geographic‐ and industry‐localization of VC investments. Empirical analyses demonstrate that the social networks in the VC community—built up through the industry’s extensive use of syndicated investing—diffuse information across boundaries and therefore expand the spatial radius of exchange.

Starting from three principles, those of agnosticism (impartiality between actors engaged in controversy), generalised symmetry (the commitment to explain conflicting viewpoints in the same terms) and free association (the abandonment of all a priori distinctions between the natural and the social), the paper describes a scientific and economic controversy about the causes for the decline in the population of scallops in St. Brieuc Bay and the attempts by three marine biologists to develop a conservation strategy for that population. Four ‘moments’ of translation are discerned in the attempts by these researchers to impose themselves and their definition of the situation on others: (a) problematisation: the researchers sought to become indispensable to other actors in the drama by denning the nature and the problems of the latter and then suggesting that these would be resolved if the actors negotiated the ‘obligatory passage point’ of the researchers' programme of investigation; (b) interessement: a series of processes by which the researchers sought to lock the other actors into the roles that had been proposed for them in that programme; (c) enrolment: a set of strategies in which the researchers sought to define and interrelate the various roles they had allocated to others; (d) mobilisation: a set of methods used by the researchers to ensure that supposed spokesmen for various relevant collectivities were properly able to represent those collectivities and not betrayed by the latter.

2689,124.0,"In this article we present a first discovery of non radial pulsations in both components of the Herbig Ae spectroscopic binary star RS Cha. The binary was monitored in quasi-continuous observations during 14 observing nights (Jan 2006) at the 1m Mt John (New Zealand) telescope with the Hercules high-resolution echelle spectrograph. The cumulated exposure time on the star was 44 hrs, corresponding to 255 individual high-resolution echelle spectra with $R = 45000$. Least square deconvolved spectra (LSD) were obtained for each spectrum representing the effective photospheric absorption profile modified by pulsations. Difference spectra were calculated by subtracting rotationally broadened artificial profiles; these residual spectra were analysed and non-radial pulsations were detected. A subsequent analysis with two complementary methods, namely Fourier Parameter Fit (FPF) and Fourier 2D (F2D) has been performed and first constraints on the pulsation modes have been derived. In fact, both components of the spectroscopic binary are Herbig Ae stars and both show NRPs. The FPF method identified 2 modes for the primary component with (degree l, azimuthal number m) couples ordered by decreasing probability: f_1 = 21.11 c/d with (l,m) = (11,11), (11,9) or (10,6) and f_2 = 30.38 c/d with (l,m) = (10,6) or (9,5).

2690,283.0,"Since the suggestion of relativistic shocks as the origin of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) in early 90's, the mathematical formulation of this process has stayed at phenomenological level. One of the reasons for the slow development of theoretical works in this domain has been the simple power-law behaviour of the afterglows hours or days after the prompt gamma-ray emission. Nowadays with the launch of the Swift satellite, gamma-ray bursts can be observed in multi-wavelength from a few tens of seconds after trigger onward. These observations have leaded to the discovery of features unexplainable by the simple formulation of the shocks and emission processes used up to now. But ""devil is in details"" and some of these features may be explained with a more detailed formulation of phenomena and without adhoc addition of new processes. Such a formulation is the goal of this work. We present a consistent formulation of the collision between two spherical relativistic shells. The model can be applied to both internal and external shocks. Notably, we propose two phenomenological models for the evolution of the emitting region during the collision. One of these models is more suitable for the internal shocks and the other for the external collisions. We calculate radiation flux, lags, and hardness ratios. One of our aims has been a formulation enough complex to include the essential processes, but enough simple such that the data can be directly compared with the theory to extract the value and evolution of physical quantities. To accomplish this goal, we also suggest a procedure for extracting parameters of the model from data. In a following paper we numerically calculate the evolution of some simulated models and compare their features with the properties of the observed gamma-ray bursts.(abbreviated)",Astronomy

The robustness of the observed fast dynamo is checked at different magnetic Reynolds numbers, and we find sustained dynamo action at moderate Rm. This indicates that the mechanism might indeed be of relevance for the real ISM. Sensing the flow via passive tracer fields, we infer that SNe produce a turbulent alpha effect which is consistent with the predictions of quasilinear theory.

2693,270.0,"We present a set of numerical simulations addressing the effects of magnetic field strength and orientation on the flow-driven formation of molecular clouds. Fields perpendicular to the flows sweeping up the cloud can efficiently prevent the formation of massive clouds but permit the build-up of cold, diffuse filaments. Fields aligned with the flows lead to substantial clouds, whose degree of fragmentation and turbulence strongly depends on the background field strength. Adding a random field component leads to a ""selection effect"" for molecular cloud formation: high column densities are only reached at locations where the field component perpendicular to the flows is vanishing. Searching for signatures of colliding flows should focus on the diffuse, warm gas, since the cold gas phase making up the cloud will have lost the information about the original flow direction because the magnetic fields redistribute the kinetic energy of the inflows.",Astronomy
2694,930.0,"Sociological studies of professions have traditionally focused on definitional list-making in an attempt to differentiate professions from nonprofessions. Despite recent criticisms of that approach, it has persisted. After first discussing inconsistencies and difficulties associated with the traditional approach, this paper explores an alternative perspective for analyzing professions. It is argued that the ability to obtain and maintain professional status is closely related to concrete occupational strategies and to wider social forces and arrangements of power. Such a perspective leads to a consideration of the social meaning of occupational tasks, the resources behind the emergence and continuation of professionalism, and the social consequences of professionalism.",Sociology

It is shown that SBF magnitudes are a valuable tracer of stellar population properties, and a reliable distance indicator. SBF magnitudes, SBF-colors, and SBF-gradients can help to constrain within relatively narrow limits the metallicity and age of the dominant stellar component in distant stellar systems, especially if coupled with other spectro-photometric indicators.",Astronomy
2696,21.0,"Radio interferometry probes astrophysical signals through incomplete and noisy Fourier measurements. The theory of compressed sensing demonstrates that such measurements may actually suffice for accurate reconstruction of sparse or compressible signals. We propose new generic imaging techniques based on convex optimization for global minimization problems defined in this context. The versatility of the framework notably allows introduction of specific prior information on the signals, which offers the possibility of significant improvements of reconstruction relative to the standard local matching pursuit algorithm CLEAN used in radio astronomy. We illustrate the potential of the approach by studying reconstruction performances on simulations of two different kinds of signals observed with very generic interferometric configurations. The first kind is an intensity field of compact astrophysical objects. The second kind is the imprint of cosmic strings in the temperature field of the cosmic microwave background radiation, of particular interest for cosmology.",Astronomy

Research in this area has not only helped explain behavior within and between organizations, but has also contributed to our understanding of status processes more generally. In this review, we point to the contributions of this field in terms of the determinants of status, the effects of status, and the mechanisms by which these effects are produced. We next appraise the way in which a network approach has contributed to our formal understanding of status positions and status hierarchies. We then highlight recent studies that demonstrate the value of studying the structures of status hierarchies themselves rather than focusing solely on the actors within them. After suggesting potential directions for future research, we conclude by calling for renewed efforts to translate concepts and theories across levels of analysis and substantive commitment in order to build more general theories of status processes.",Sociology

Religion is moving from a broadband construct-one that includes both the institutional and the individual, and the good and the bad-to a narrowband institutional construct that restricts and inhibits human potential. Spirituality, on the other hand, is becoming differentiated from religion as an individual expression that speaks to the greatest of human capacities. Several dangers in these trends are consiciered, including the danger of losing the sacred core of our field. An alternate approach to defining religion and spirituality is presented that preserves the heart of our discipline while encouraging the study of new pathways to the sacred and new meanings of the sacred itself.",Psychology
2699,209.0,"The chemistry in the central regions of galaxies is expected to be strongly influenced by their nuclear activity. To find the best tracers of nuclear activity is of key importance to understand the processes taking place in the most obscured regions of galactic nuclei. In this work we present multi-line observations of CS, C34S, HNCO and C18O in a sample of 11 bright galaxies prototypical for different types of activity. The 32S/34S isotopic ratio is ~10, supporting the idea of an isotopical 34S enrichment due to massive star formation in the nuclear regions of galaxies. Although C32S and C34S do not seem to be significantly affected by the activity type, the HNCO abundance appears highly contrasted among starburst. We observed HNCO abundance variations of nearly two orders of magnitude. The HNCO molecule is shown to be a good tracer of the amount of molecular material fueling the starburst and therefore can be used as a diagnostics of the evolutionary state of a nuclear starburst.",Astronomy

2705,597.0,"The constructivist psychologies theorize about and investigate how human beings create systems for meaningfully understanding their worlds and experiences. I refer to these “constructivisms” using the plural because there are many varieties of constructivism (Neimeyer & Raskin, 2001) and they have been described in various constellations (Botella, 1995; Chiari & Nuzzo, 1996a, 1996b; Lyddon, 1995; Mahoney, 1988, 1991, 1995; Rosen, 1996; Sexton, 1997). Depending upon how one chooses to carve out categories of constructivism, one finds differing areas of commonality and divergence. Regardless, the constructivist psychologies have grown immensely in quantity and influence over the past fifty years, originating in a variety of theoretical and research venues that have slowly developed greater contact with each other and with psychology at large. In fact, as the 21 Century begins, constructivist psychologists find themselves standing at the crossroads, ready to make their mark on the broader discipline of psychology. However, despite their steadily growing influence, constructivist psychologies have not evolved into a single, coherent, theoretically consistent orientation. Given numerous theoretical differences, there is not even agreement among constructivist psychologists that arriving at a singularly recognizable orientation is desirable. Nevertheless, some constructivist psychologists’ efforts to form a loosely confederated constructivist theoretical orientation have made inroads into mainstream psychology, as evidenced by the",Psychology

Just six years later, Ben-David (1981) published a review article with ""Sociology of Scientific Knowledge"" as the title. These two articles indicate the phenomenal growth of the subdiscipline in recent years.

As a participant in the development of the subject I can bear witness to both the excitement and disappointment of the period. It was exciting because the sociology of scientific knowledge appeared to promise a kind of sociological perfection. It was a field in which detailed empirical research could have the most profound theoretical consequences. Accessible and self-contained institutions contained the fundamental secrets of certainty and we had only to split these social ""atoms"" to create the light of understanding. It was immediately disappointing because hardly anybody in the major sociological marketplace, the United States, saw the light; all they felt, as it were, was the draught.

Tests of the Weak Equivalence Principle also lead to comparable bounds on present variations of constants. The ""winner in sensitivity"" depends on what relations exist between the variations of different couplings in the standard model of particle physics, which may arise from the unification of gauge interactions. WEP tests are currently the most sensitive within unified scenarios. A detection of time variation in atomic clocks would favour dynamical dark energy and put strong constraints on the dynamics of a cosmological scalar field.",Astronomy
2709,19.0,"The findings of a nine orbit calibration plan carried out during HST Cycle 15, to fully determine the NICMOS camera 2 (2.0 micron) polarization calibration to high accuracy, are reported. Recently Ueta et al. and Batcheldor et al. have suggested that NICMOS possesses a residual instrumental polarization at a level of 1.2-1.5%. This would completely inhibit the data reduction in a number of GO programs, and hamper the ability of the instrument to perform high accuracy polarimetry. We obtained polarimetric calibration observations of three polarimetric standards at three spacecraft roll angles separated by ~60deg. Combined with archival data, these observations were used to characterize the residual instrumental polarization in order for NICMOS to reach its full potential of accurate imaging polarimetry at p~1%. Using these data, we place an 0.6% upper limit on the instrumental polarization and calculate values of the parallel transmission coefficients that reproduce the ground-based results for the polarimetric standards. The uncertainties associated with the parallel transmission coefficients, a result of the photometric repeatability of the observations, are seen to dominate the accuracy of p and theta. However, the updated coefficients do allow imaging polarimetry of targets with p~1.0% at an accuracy of +/-0.6% and +/-15deg. This work enables a new caliber of science with HST.",Astronomy

And yet, unlike in the pre-civil rights era, when racial prejudice and discrimination were overt and widespread, today discrimination is less readily identifiable, posing problems for social scientific conceptualization and measurement. This article reviews the relevant literature on discrimination, with an emphasis on racial discrimination in employment, housing, credit markets, and consumer interactions. We begin by defining discrimination and discussing relevant methods of measurement. We then provide an overview of major findings from studies of discrimination in each of the four domains; and, finally, we turn to a discussion of the individual, organizational, and structural mechanisms that may underlie contemporary forms of discrimination. This discussion seeks to orient readers to some of the key debates in the study of discrimination and to provide a roadmap for those interested in building upon this long and important line of research.",Sociology

We can understand this as a position that a social actor occupies, or we can imagine such resources as a possession of an actor. The study of elites is the study of power and inequality, from above. It involves looking at the distribution of social resources, which can include economic, social, cultural, political, or knowledge capital. It also means exploring the role of institutions such as schools, families, and clubs in how such resources are organized and distributed.

Empirical observations of these phenomena point to the changing character of American inequality.",Sociology
2712,505.0,"Industrial and organizational psychology (I-O) has a long history of research and application in both the United States and abroad. In America, its earliest roots are found in the work of Hugo Munsterberg, a colleague of William James and chair of the Department of Psychology at Harvard at the beginning of the twentieth century. Munsterberg was a pioneer in industrial selection, which is still a core activity of I-O psychologists. He developed tests to hire applicants for jobs such as telephone operator and trolley driver (Landy, 1992). There has been an unbroken development of testing technique and theory for the 100 years since then. Two additional major figures in the early development of I-O psychology (circa 1910–1940) were Walter Dill Scott and Walter Van Dyke Bingham (Landy, 1993, 1997). The early history of I-O psychology was one of application of more general psychological principles, such as learning, without much emphasis on theory development (Viteles, 1932). By 1960, this had changed, and I-O psychology then and to the present day has adopted an integrated scientist-practitioner model for academic training, practice, and research.",Psychology
2713,266.0,"We report on the results from Suzaku broadband X-ray observations of the galactic binary source LS5039. The Suzaku data, which have continuous coverage of more than one orbital period, show strong modulation of the X-ray emission at the orbital period of this TeV gamma-ray emitting system.The X-ray emission shows a minimum at orbital phase ~ 0.1, close to the so-called superior conjunction of the compact object, and a maximum at phase ~0.7, very close to the inferior conjunction of the compact object. The X-ray spectral data up to 70 keV are described by a hard power-law with a phase-dependent photon index which varies within Gamma ~1.45 - 1.61. The amplitude of the flux variation is a factor of 2.5, but is significantly less than that of the factor ~8 variation in the TeV flux. Otherwise the two light curves are similar, but not identical. Although periodic X-ray emission has been found from many galactic binary systems, the Suzaku result implies a phenomenon different from the ""standard"" origin of X-rays related to the emission of the hot accretion plasma formed around the compact companion object. The X-ray radiation of LS5039is likely to be linked to very-high-energy electrons which are also responsible for the TeV gamma-ray emission. While the gamma-rays are the result of inverse Compton scattering by electrons on optical stellar photons, X-rays are produced via synchrotron radiation. Yet, while the modulation of the TeV gamma-ray signal can be naturally explained by the photon-photon pair production and anisotropic inverse Compton scattering, the observed modulation of synchrotron X-rays requires an additional process, the most natural one being adiabatic expansion in the radiation production region.",Astronomy

The present paper argues against this view as it applies to some important issues in social psychology. First, it is contended that the ‘individualistic’ bias of research in social psychology derives from the nature of the theories dominating the discipline. Second, a theory of inter-group behaviour is briefly outlined in order to show that its structure and aims are different in some important ways from the individualistic theories. The bias of these theories which is due to their assumption that social behaviour takes place inside homogeneous and unstructured social systems is illustrated using as examples the theory of belief similarity in prejudice and equity theory.",Psychology

Motivated by this study we follow the thermonuclear runaway on massive white dwarfs (M_WD=1.25 - 1.40 solar masses) with Tc lower than 10^7 K, accreting matter of solar composition. We demonstrate that in that range of the relevant parameter space (Tc,M_WD and accretion rate) the slope of the relation between the peak temperatures achieved during the runaway and Tc becomes much steeper than its value for Tc above 10^7 K. The peak temperatures we derive can lead to nuclear breakout from the conventional ""hot carbon-nitrogen-oxygen"" cycle. When breakout conditions are achieved the heavy element abundances can show a much wider variety than what is possible with the common enrichment mechanisms.",Astronomy

2718,511.0,"The distinctive metatheoretical and empirical significance of the social identity concept for social psychology is outlined with special reference to social influence and group polarization. ‘Individualism’ and ‘interactionism’ are summarized and contrasted as alternative metatheories of social psychology and it is argued that the social identity concept embodies the latter. A social identity theory of group behaviour (and the individual-group relationship) is introduced and from it are derived further theories of social influence and group polarization. The latter is explained as a special case of normal intragroup influence. It is shown how the social identity theory (theories) of group behaviour, social influence and group polarization explicitly assumes a functional interaction between psychological and social processes, in contrast to individualism, and at the same time generates distinctive, testable, empirical predictions. It is concluded that the social identity concept represents a mechanism of social-psychological interaction and as such demonstrates that social psychology need not be an individualistic science.",Psychology
2719,867.0,"While various attempts have been made to link nature and society more closely together within environmental sociology, it now appears as though there is a general acceptance of rather traditional divisions between these two domains. Yet ecology specifies that natural and social entities are bound together in complex interrelations. Why then does sociology insist on sifting out the social from the natural? The paper takes this question as its starting point and seeks to identify what environmental sociology might gain and lose from a shift towards ecological thinking. It does so by examining the case of actor-network theory, an approach that, in significant respects, closely approximates a kind of `ecological sociology'. Actor-network theory is `co-constructionist': it seeks to identify how relations and entities come into being together. Critics have focused on the problems of co-constructionism: they have argued that human actors generally possess powers of reflection (through language) and that these powers of reflection provide motive forces for action. Thus some form of social analysis is still necessary. Any ecological sociology will thus need to bring these two perspectives together so that humans and non-humans can be considered within the same frame of reference but so the distinctions that generally hold between the two can also be assessed.",Sociology

Second, as outlined in computational models, habits and deliberate goal pursuit guide actions synergistically, although habits are the efficient, default mode of response. Third, people tend to infer from the frequency of habit performance that the behavior must have been intended.

2723,18.0,"Europa is believed to have formed near the very end of Jupiter's own accretion, within a circumplanetary disk of gas and solid particles. We review the formation of the Galilean satellites in the context of current constraints and understanding of giant planet formation, focusing on recent models of satellite growth within a circumjovian accretion disk produced during the final stages of gas inflow to Jupiter. In such a disk, the Galilean satellites would have accreted slowly, in more than 10^5 yr, and in a low pressure, low gas density environment. Gravitational interactions between the satellites and the gas disk lead to inward orbital migration and loss of satellites to Jupiter. Such effects tend to select for a maximum satellite mass and a common total satellite system mass compared to the planet's mass. One implication is that multiple satellite systems may have formed and been lost during the final stages of Jupiter's growth, with the Galilean satellites being the last generation that survived as gas inflow to Jupiter ended. We conclude by discussing open issues and implications for Europa's conditions of formation.",Astronomy

In parallel, we have observed the CO(J=6-5) line in J1148+5251, which is detected at a flux level consistent with earlier interferometric observations. Using our earlier measurements of the [CII] 158 micron line strength, we derive an upper limit for the [NII]/[CII] line luminosity ratio of ~1/10 in J1148+5251. Our upper limit for the [CII]/[NII] ratio is similar to the value found for our Galaxy and M82 (the only extragalactic system where the [NII] line has been detected to date).

We can reproduce the smooth Fermi/HESS spectra as well as the spiky ATIC/PPB-BETS spectra. The spectra have a sharp cutoff that is similar to the dark matter predictions, sometimes together with a line (not similar), since higher energy cosmic-rays cool faster where the cutoff/line energy marks the source age. A GRB-like astrophysical source is expected to have a small but finite spread in the cutoff/line as well as anisotropy in the cosmic-ray and diffuse gamma-ray flux, providing a method for the Fermi and future CALET experiments to discriminate between dark matter and astrophysical origins.",Astronomy

2730,876.0,"Theories of pain have traditionally been dominated by biomedicine and concentrate upon its neurophysiological aspects, both in diagnosis and treatment. Hence, scientific medicine reduces the experience of pain to an elaborate broadcasting system of signals, rather than seeing it as moulded and shaped both by the individual and their particular socio-cultural context. Although pain lies at the intersection between biology and culture, making it an obvious topic for sociological investigation, scant attention has been paid to understanding beliefs about pain within the study of health and illness. A major impediment to a more adequate conceptualisation of pain is due to the manner in which it has been ‘medicalised’, resulting in the inevitable Cartesian split between body and mind. Consequently, the dominant conceptualisation of pain has focused upon sensation, with the subsequent inference that it is able to be rationally and objectively measured. Yet as well as being a medical ‘problem’, pain is an everyday experience. Moreover, sociological and phenomenological approaches to pain would add to, and enhance, existing bodies of knowledge and help to reclaim pain from the dominant scientific paradigm. In this paper, it is argued, firstly, that the elevation of sensation over emotion within medico-psychological approaches to pain, can be shown to be limiting and reductionist. Secondly, we attempt to show how insights from the newly-emerging sociological arenas of emotions and embodiment provide a framework which is able to both transcend the divide between mind and body and to develop a phenomenological approach to pain. Finally, in order to bring the meaning of pain into fuller focus, we draw attention to the importance of studying theodices and narratives, as well as the cultural shaping and patterning of beliefs and responses to pain.",Sociology

We conclude by discussing challenging new obstacles in the field, calling for increased attention to sociological theory, and identifying new areas where computational social science might be further integrated into mainstream sociology.",Sociology
2732,554.0,"Suicide is a leading cause of death, but it is not well understood or well researched. Our purpose in this review is to summarize extant knowledge on neurobiological and psychological factors involved in suicide, with specific goals of identifying areas particularly in need of future research and of articulating an initial agenda that may guide future research. We conclude that from both neurobiological and psychological perspectives, extant research findings converge on the view that two general categories of risk for suicide can be identified: (a) dysregulated impulse control; and (b) propensity to intense psychological pain (e.g., social isolation, hopelessness), often in the context of mental disorders, especially mood disorders. Each of these categories of risk is underlain at least to some degree by specific genetic and neurobiological factors; these factors in general are not well characterized, though there is emerging consensus that most if not all reside in or affect the serotonergic system. We encourage future theorizing that is conceptually precise, as well as epistemically broad, about the specific preconditions of serious suicidal behavior, explaining the daunting array of suicide-related facts from the molecular to the cultural level.",Psychology
2733,910.0,"This paper is concerned with the relationship between sociology and nature or the environment. We briefly summarise the various ways in which historically `nature' has been conceptualised, including the connections between the `natural' and the `market'. We suggest that there are many `natures' and then proceed to develop an agenda for a sociology of such natures. This comprises four elements: a sociology of environmental knowledges; social variation in the reading of natures; a sociology of the diverse forms of environmental damage; and a more general examination of environmentalism and society. We conclude with an examination of the relations between culture and nature suggesting that changes in this relationship now demonstrates what has always been the case, namely, that nature is elaborately entangled and fundamentally bound up with the social and the cultural. As the social and the cultural are both rapidly changing provides deciphering that relationship immensely fruitful but complex areas for future sociological work.",Sociology
2734,504.0,"Many animals produce and respond to signals made up of multiple components. For example, many avian sexual displays are highly extravagant combinations of visual and acoustic elements, and are described as being 'multicomponent'. One possible reason for the evolution of such complex signals is that they provide more reliable information for receivers. However, receivers also influence signal evolution in another important way, by how they perceive and process signals: signallers will be selected to produce signals that are more easily received. The potential role of receiver psychology in the evolution of multicomponent signals has not previously been considered; in this review I present psychological results that support the notion that two components are better received than one alone. Detection can be improved by producing two components together, thus reducing the reaction time, increasing the probability of detection and lowering the intensity at which detection occurs. Discriminability of multicomponent stimuli is also made easier through better recognition, faster discrimination learning and multidimensional generalization. In addition, multicomponent stimuli also improve associative learning. I show that multicomponency does indeed improve signal reception in receivers, although the benefits of producing components in two sensory modalities (bimodal multicomponent signals) may be larger and more robust than producing them in just one (unimodal multicomponent signals). This highlights the need for consideration of receiver psychology in the evolution of multicomponent signals, and suggests that where signal components do not appear to be informative, they may instead be performing an important psychological function.

2736,368.0,"Abstract This position paper introduces the emerging concept of work engagement: a positive, fulfilling, affective-motivational state of work-related well-being that is characterized by vigour, dedication, and absorption. Although there are different views of work engagement, most scholars agree that engaged employees have high levels of energy and identify strongly with their work. The most often used instrument to measure engagement is the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale, a self-report instrument that has been validated in many countries across the world. Research on engagement has investigated how engagement differs from related concepts (e.g., workaholism, organizational commitment), and has focused on the most important predictors of work engagement. These studies have revealed that engagement is a unique concept that is best predicted by job resources (e.g., autonomy, supervisory coaching, performance feedback) and personal resources (e.g., optimism, self-efficacy, self-esteem). Moreover, the first studies have shown that work engagement is predictive of job performance and client satisfaction. The paper closes with an account of what we do not know about work engagement, and offers a brief research agenda for future work.",Psychology

Also, we have accurate description of bremsstrahlung photons in nuclear reactions in Sun.

2746,267.0,"Context: Narrow-band surveys for Ly-alpha emitters (LAEs) is a powerful tool in detecting high, and very high, redshift galaxies. Even though samples are growing at redshifts z = 3 - 6, the nature of these galaxies is still poorly known. Aims: To study the properties of z = 2.25 LAEs and compare those with the properties of z &gt; 3 LAEs. Methods: We present narrow-band imaging made with the MPG/ESO 2.2m telescope with the WFI detector. We have made a selection for emission-line objects and find 170 candidate typical LAEs and 17 candidates which we regard as high UV-transmission LAEs. We have derived the magnitudes of these objects in 8 bands from u* to Ks, and studied if they have X-ray and/or radio counterparts. Results: We show that there has been significant evolution in the properties of LAEs between redshift z ~ 3 and z = 2.25. The spread in spectral energy distributions (SEDs) at the lower redshift is larger and we detect a significant AGN contribution in the sample. The distribution of the equivalent widths is narrower than at z ~ 3, with only a few candidates with rest-frame equivalent width above the predicted limit of 240 A. The star formation rates derived from the Ly-alpha emission compared to that derived from the UV emission are lower by on average a factor of ~ 1.8, indicating a large absorption of dust. Conclusion: LAEs at redshift z = 2.25 may be more evolved than LAEs at higher redshift. The red SEDs imply more massive, older and/or more dusty galaxies at lower redshift than observed at higher redshifts. The decrease in equivalent widths and star formation rates indicate more quiescent galaxies, with in general less star formation than in higher redshift galaxies. At z = 2.25, AGN appear to be more abundant and also to contribute more to the LAE population. [Abridged]",Astronomy

2750,699.0,"Sociology has seen a renewed interest in the study of morality. However, a theory of the self that explains individual variation in moral behavior and emotions is noticeably absent. In this study, we use identity theory to explain this variability. According to identity theory, actors are self-regulating entities whose goal is to verify their identities. An individual’s moral identity—wherever it falls on the moral–immoral continuum—guides behavior, and people experience negative emotions when identity verification does not ensue. Furthermore, the identity verification process occurs within situations that have cultural expectations—that is, framing rules and feeling rules—regarding how individuals should act and feel. These cultural expectations also influence the degree to which people behave morally. We test these assumptions on a sample of more than 350 university students. We investigate whether the moral identity and framing situations in moral terms influences behavior and feelings. Findings reveal that the identity process and framing of situations as moral are significantly associated with moral action and moral emotions of guilt and shame.",Sociology

The system shows flux variations with a peak-to-peak amplitude of about 0.7 mag and a period of about 6.96h. In August 2007, 13 spectra of SDSSJ212531.92-010745.9 covering the full orbital phase range were taken at the TWIN 3.5m telescope at the Calar Alto Observatory (Alm\'{e}ria, Spain). These confirm the typical PG1159 features seen in the SDSS discovery spectrum, together with the Balmer series of hydrogen in emission (plus other emission lines), interpreted as signature of the companion's irradiated side. A radial velocity curve was obtained for both components. Using co-added radial-velocity-corrected spectra, the spectral analysis of the PG1159 star is being refined.

2759,231.0,"Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) in the radial direction offer a method to directly measure the Universe expansion history, and to set limits to space curvature when combined to the angular BAO signal. In addition to spectroscopic surveys, radial BAO might be measured from accurate enough photometric redshifts obtained with narrow-band filters. We explore the requirements for a photometric survey using Luminous Red Galaxies (LRG) to competitively measure the radial BAO signal and discuss the possible systematic errors of this approach. If LRG were a highly homogeneous population, we show that the photo-z accuracy would not substantially improve by increasing the number of filters beyond $\sim 10$, except for a small fraction of the sources detected at high signal-to-noise, and broad-band filters would suffice to achieve the target $\sigma_z = 0.003 (1+z)$ for measuring radial BAO. Using the LRG spectra obtained from SDSS, we find that the spectral variability of LRG substantially worsens the achievable photometric redshift errors, and that the optimal system consists of $\sim$ 30 filters of width $\Delta \lambda / \lambda \sim 0.02$. A $S/N &gt; 20$ is generally necessary at the filters on the red side of the $H\alpha$ break to reach the target photometric accuracy. We estimate that a 5-year survey in a dedicated telescope with etendue in excess of 60 ${\rm m}^2 {\rm deg}^2$ would be necessary to obtain a high enough density of galaxies to measure radial BAO with sufficiently low shot noise up to $z= 0.85$.

2760,123.0,"Recent radioastronomical observations of Faraday rotation in the solar corona can be interpreted as evidence for coronal currents, with values as large as $2.5 \times 10^9$ Amperes (Spangler 2007). These estimates of currents are used to develop a model for Joule heating in the corona. It is assumed that the currents are concentrated in thin current sheets, as suggested by theories of two dimensional magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. The Spitzer result for the resistivity is adopted as a lower limit to the true resistivity. The calculated volumetric heating rate is compared with an independent theoretical estimate by Cranmer et al (2007). This latter estimate accounts for the dynamic and thermodynamic properties of the corona at a heliocentric distance of several solar radii. Our calculated Joule heating rate is less than the Cranmer et al estimate by at least a factor of $3 \times 10^5$. The currents inferred from the observations of Spangler (2007) are not relevant to coronal heating unless the true resistivity is enormously increased relative to the Spitzer value. However, the same model for turbulent current sheets used to calculate the heating rate also gives an electron drift speed which can be comparable to the electron thermal speed, and larger than the ion acoustic speed. It is therefore possible that the coronal current sheets are unstable to current-driven instabilities which produce high levels of waves, enhance the resistivity and thus the heating rate.",Astronomy

Social identities are self-definitions that are more inclusive than the individuated self-concept of most American psychology. A model of optimal distinctiveness is proposed in which social identity is viewed as a reconciliation of opposing needs for assimilation and differentiation from others. According to this model, individuals avoid self-construals that are either too personalized or too inclusive and instead define themselves in terms of distinctive category memberships.

These characteristics are commercially important because, according to the convictions of the fishermen, the consumers prefer coralled scallops to those which are not. Throughout the 1970s, the stock at Brest progressively dwindled due to the combined effects of marine predators (starfish), a series of hard winters which lowered the general temperature of the water, and the fishermen who, wanting to satisfy the insatiable consumers, dredged the ocean floor for scallops all year round without allowing time to reproduce. The production of St. Brieuc had also been falling off",Sociology

By the middle 1970s, and perhaps even earlier, Alex had hoped that astronomical molecules would prove to: possess significant diagnostic utility; control many of the environments in which they exist; stimulate a wide variety of physicists and chemists who are at least as fascinated by the mechanisms forming and removing the molecules as by astronomy. His own research efforts have contributed greatly to the realization of that hope. This paper contains a few examples of: how molecules are used to diagnose large-scale dynamics in astronomical sources including star forming regions and supernovae; the ways in which molecular processes control the evolution of astronomical objects such as dense cores destined to become stars and very evolved giant stars; theoretical and laboratory investigations that elucidate the processes producing and removing astronomical molecules and allow their detection.",Astronomy

2776,319.0,"Although researchers have long been aware that the species-typical architecture of the human mind is the product of our evolutionary history, it has only been in the last three decades that advances in such fields as evolutionary biology, cognitive psychology, and paleoanthropology have made the fact of our evolution illuminating. Converging findings from a variety of disciplines are leading to the emergence of a fundamentally new view of the human mind, and with it a new framework for the behavioral and social sciences. First, with the advent of the cognitive revolution, human nature can finally be defined precisely as the set of universal, species-typical information-processing programs that operate beneath the surface of expressed cultural variability. Second, this collection of cognitive programs evolved in the Pleistocene to solve the adaptive problems regularly faced by our hunter-gatherer ancestors--problems such as mate selection, language acquisition, cooperation, and sexual infidelity. Consequently, the traditional view of the mind as a general-purpose computer, tabula rasa, or passive recipient of culture is being replaced by the view that the mind resembles an intricate network of functionally specialized computers, each of which imposes contentful structure on human mental organization and culture. The Adapted Mind explores this new approach--evolutionary psychology--and its implications for a new view of culture.",Psychology

Building on a review of existing principles of good practice in qualitative research, we used an iterative process of revision and feedback from colleagues who engage in qualitative research, resulting in a set of seven guidelines common to both qualitative and quantitative research and seven guidelines especially pertinent to qualitative investigations in psychology and related social sciences. The Evolving Guidelines are subject to continuing revision and should not be used in a rigid manner, in order to avoid stifling creativity in this rapidly evolving, rich research tradition.",Psychology

This phenomenon, which clashes with the image of secularization, is particularly notable among the youth of the counterculture. To further sociological analysis, a conceptualization of esoteric culture is proposed. It is further argued that esoteric culture has played a significant role in Western cultural change, in such areas as artistic expressions of reality, political ideas, and even scientific thought. Esoteric culture is thus treated as a source of ideational innovations in Western modernization.",Sociology
2779,94.0,"We propose a new mechanism which explains the existence of enormously sharp edges in the rings of Saturn. This mechanism is based on the synchronization phenomenon due to which the epicycle rotational phases of particles in the ring, under certain conditions, become synchronized with the phase of external satellite, e.g. with the phase of Mimas in the case of the outer B ring edge. This synchronization eliminates collisions between particles and suppress the diffusion induced by collisions by orders of magnitude. The minimum of the diffusion is reached at the center of the synchronization regime corresponding to the ratio 2:1 between the orbital frequency at the edge of B ring and the orbital frequency of Mimas. The synchronization theory gives the sharpness of the edge in few tens of meters that is in agreement with available observations.",Astronomy
2780,826.0,"Though the word ""sociology"" was coined in Europe, the field of sociology grew most dramatically in America. Despite that disproportionate influence, American sociology has never been the subject of an extended historical examination. To remedy that situation-and to celebrate the centennial of the American Sociological Association-Craig Calhoun assembled a team of leading sociologists to produce ""Sociology in"" ""America""."" ""Rather than a story of great sociologists or departments, ""Sociology in America"" is a true history of an often disparate field-and a deeply considered look at the ways sociology developed intellectually and institutionally. It explores the growth of American sociology as it addressed changes and challenges throughout the twentieth century, covering topics ranging from the discipline's intellectual roots to understandings (and misunderstandings) of race and gender to the impact of the Depression and the 1960s. ""Sociology in America"" will stand as the definitive treatment of the contribution of twentieth-century American sociology and will be required reading for all sociologists.

This article offers a general sociological approach to this question, using the economic value of nature as a paradigmatic case, and oil spills litigations in France and the United States as real world empirical illustrations. It suggests that a full-blown sociology of economic valuation must solve three problems: the “why,” which refers to the general place of money as a metric for worth; the “how,” which refers to the specific techniques and arguments laymen and experts deploy to elicit monetary translations; and the “then what” or the feedback loop from monetary values to social practices and representations.",Sociology
2782,350.0,"Humans are an ultrasocial species. This sociality, however, cannot be fully explained by the canonical approaches found in evolutionary biology, psychology, or economics. Understanding our unique social psychology requires accounting not only for the breadth and intensity of human cooperation but also for the variation found across societies, over history, and among behavioral domains. Here, we introduce an expanded evolutionary approach that considers how genetic and cultural evolution, and their interaction, may have shaped both the reliably developing features of our minds and the well-documented differences in cultural psychologies around the globe. We review the major evolutionary mechanisms that have been proposed to explain human cooperation, including kinship, reciprocity, reputation, signaling, and punishment; we discuss key culture-gene coevolutionary hypotheses, such as those surrounding self-domestication and norm psychology; and we consider the role of religions and marriage systems. Empirically, we synthesize experimental and observational evidence from studies of children and adults from diverse societies with research among nonhuman primates.

2783,113.0,"We study the Wouthuysen-Field coupling at early universe with numerical solutions of the integrodifferential equation describing the kinetics of photons undergoing resonant scattering. The numerical solver is developed based on the weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) scheme for the Boltzmann-like integrodifferential equation. We focus on the time evolution of the Wouthuysen-Field (W-F) coupling in relation to the 21 cm emission and absorption at the epoch of reionization. We show that a local Boltzmann distribution will be formed if photons with frequency \sim \nu_0 have undergone a ten thousand or more times of scattering, which corresponds to the order of 10^3 yrs for neutral hydrogen density of the concordance \Lambda CDM model. The time evolution of the shape and width of the local Boltzmann distribution actually doesn't dependent on the details of atomic recoil, photon sources, or initial conditions very much. However, the intensity of photon flux at the local Boltzmann distribution is substantially time-dependent. The time scale of approaching the saturated intensity can be as long as 10^5-10^6 yrs for typical parameters of the \Lambda CDM model. The intensity of the local Boltzmann distribution at time less than 10^5 yrs is significantly lower than that of the saturation state. Therefore, it may not be always reasonable to assume that the deviation of the spin temperature of 21 cm energy states from cosmic background temperature is mainly due to the W-F coupling if first stars or their emission/absorption regions evolved with a time scale equal to or less than Myrs.",Astronomy

2789,838.0,"The aim of this essay is to provide a synthesis of empirical and theoretical research in an area that is a point of convergence for much of the literature on social stratification, occupational sociology, industrial sociology, the sociology of organizations, and labor economics . The analysis of labor mar­ kets is an important concern for sociological inquiry; it permits an under­ standing of the way macro forces associated with the economy of a society and elements of social structure impinge on the microrelations between employers and workers in determining various forms of inequality. Since the majority of people in industrial society obtain income and other rewards in exchange for work, labor market processes form the central mechanisms of social distribution in industrial society (Caplow, 1954). The concept of ""labor markets"" has many connotations. It has been used to denote geographical areas or occupational and industrial groups, as well as groups of workers defined by ethnicity, race, sex, and levels of education and skill. We define labor markets abstractly, as the arenas in which work­ ers exchange their l abor power in return for wages, status, and other job rewards. The concept, therefore, refers broadly to the institutions and prac­ tices that govern the purchase, sale, and pricing of labor services. These structures include the means by which workers are distributed among jobs and the rules that govern employment, mobility, the acquisition of skills and",Sociology
2790,552.0,"As the field of psychology continues to expand and evolve, one fruitful avenue of exploration has been the integration of mindfulness into psychological theory and practice. Mindfulness is defined as the awareness that arises out of intentionally attending in an open and discerning way to whatever is arising in the present moment. Two decades of empirical research have generated considerable evidence supporting the efficacy of mindfulness-based interventions across a wide range of clinical and nonclinical populations, and these interventions have been incorporated into a variety of health care settings. Still, there are many unanswered questions and potential horizons to be investigated. This special issue endeavors to assist in this exploration. It presents a combination of articles concerning aspects of clinical and scientific integration of mindfulness within psychotherapy and psychoeducational settings. This commentary attempts to highlight the main findings of the featured articles as well as elucidate areas for future inquiry. Taken as a whole, the volume supports the importance and viability of the integration of mindfulness into psychology, and offers interesting and meaningful directions for future research.",Psychology

It then turns to more recent developments in STS, outlining the importance of material semiotics to important traditions within the discipline including those influenced by actor network theory, feminism, and postcolonialism. It notes, in consistency with the Foucauldian approach, that material semiotics implies that knowledge traditions are performative, helping to create the realities that they describe. The paper concludes by exploring the implications of this performatibity for the politics of research methods and for the future character of social science research.",Sociology
